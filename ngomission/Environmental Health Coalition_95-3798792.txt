Founded in 1980, the Environmental Health Coalition (EHC) is dedicated to achieving environmental and social justice. We believe that justice is accomplished by empowered communities acting together to make social change. We organize and advocate to protect public health and the environment threatened by toxic pollution. EHC supports broad efforts that create a just society which foster a healthy and sustainable quality of life. EHC has responded to community needs in the region by empowering citizens through community organization and technical assistance, and by developing policies which lead to long-term solutions. By participating in national and international networks, EHC effectively disseminates information and creates social policy change on a broader scale.
