The mission of the United Way of Fairfield County is to improve lives through the caring power of our community. Here in Fairfield County, we're focused on critical issues such as helping children and youth succeed, family stability, health care, mental health and wellness and job development. Our goal is long lasting change that prevents problems from happening in the first place. We are working to transform that financial tightrope into solid ground by helping families learn the basics of budgeting, increase their income and start to set aside savings.
