Catholic Social Services (CSS) of Southern Nebraska traces its beginnings to 1932 when Bishop Louis Kucera founded CSS to respond to the needs of persons suffering the effects of the Great Depression. We are an agency of the Catholic Diocese of Lincoln serving under the auspices of Bishop Fabian Bruskewitz. Catholic Social Services' Department of Social Services meets the material needs of people, extending the love of Christ and the Church through programs in food, shelter, clothing, material and financial assistance, refugee resettlement, and special holiday projects. The Department provides these services through office sites and facilities located in Lincoln, Nebraska and Hastings, Nebraska.
