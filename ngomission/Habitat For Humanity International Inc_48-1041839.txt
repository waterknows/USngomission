Heartland Habitat for Humanity's mission is to build simple, decent homes and communities in partnership with God's people in need, while following biblical principles. Established in 2006, Heartland Habitat was formed by the merger of Kaw Valley Habitat for Humanity and Northland Habitat for Humanity. Since 1987, the two Habitat affiliates have built over 215 homes in Wyandotte, Leavenworth and Johnson counties in Kansas and Clay and Platte counties in Missouri.
