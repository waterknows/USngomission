Mission Year is a national Christian ministry dedicated to making lifelong disciples, developing leaders, and mobilizing Christians to love God and love their neighbor. We are an entry point into a lifestyle of faith, community, service, and justice that provides Christian young people with the opportunity to become part of the life of an urban neighborhood in Atlanta, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Houston during a yearlong program. We are Christ-centered, neighborhood focused, and justice oriented. We provide on-going support and training throughout the year for personal transformation and growth.
