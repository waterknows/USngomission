Founded in 1983, the Montana Food Bank Network (MFBN) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that works to end hunger in Montana through food acquisition and distribution, education and advocacy. As a statewide food bank, MFBN solicits, sorts, repackages, warehouses, and distributes donated and purchased food to charitable programs that directly serve hungry Montanans. From a main warehouse and office in Missoula, MFBN distributes emergency food across the state through a network of nearly 200 Partner Agencies. MFBN is the only fully privileged Montana member of Feeding America, the national hunger fighting organization.Each year the Montana Food Bank Network distributes approximately 8 million pounds of food around the state. MFBN partners with local emergency food programs to feed those who may otherwise go hungry, including women and children, the elderly, people with disabilities and the working poor.
