Incorporated in 1981, the Fuel Fund of Maryland provides resources to vulnerable Maryland families for heat and home utility needs. We support and advocate collaborative funding and services that ensure affordable energy to families that must overcome hardship caused by poverty and assist these families to meet their human needs. The Fuel Fund serves vulnerable Marylanders in Baltimore City and Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Carroll, Harford, Howard and Montgomery counties. In 2007 we helped nearly 18,000 individuals. The target population is families and individuals in Central Maryland who live at or below 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines.
