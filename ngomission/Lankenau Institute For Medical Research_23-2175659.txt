Founded in 1927, the mission of the Lankenau Institute for Medical Research is to advance human health and well-being through research to improve the detection and treatment of disease; the rapid transfer of new technology to the clinic; and the training of the next generation of scientists and physicians. Our rich history, staff of over 120, and hard working board of trustees allows us to continue our commitment to advancing an understanding of the causes of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Located on the campus of Lankenau Hospital, our scientists perform basic research studies to understand the fundamental problems associated with disease; preclinical and translational research where results are developed into new diagnostics or medications; and clinical research where advances in medicine can be brought to the patient bedside.
