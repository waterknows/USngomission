The Museum achieves this goal through the acquisition, preservation, and interpretation of original artifacts of American art and history. To this end, the Museum recognizes its responsibility to present exhibitions, educational programs, and publications that contribute to a greater appreciation of the nation's artistic accomplishments and the region's distinctive cultural history.
