French Camp Academy, a Christ centered home and school, exists to serve young people and families for the glory of God. We provide a safe, stable, healing place for young people from families in crisis. The Presbyterian church established two schools in 1885: as The Central Mississippi Institute for girls and French Camp Academy for boys. In 1915, fire destroyed the girls' institute and the schools were combined under the name French Camp Academy. French Camp Academy accepts young people from all over the country who, for one reason or another, need a place to live and learn away from home. Though French Camp Academy has primarily served young people since its founding, it is currently developing programs to offer families that promote health and healing in relationships.
