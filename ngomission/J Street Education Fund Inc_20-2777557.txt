J Street is the political home for pro-Israel, pro-peace Americans who want Israel to be secure, democratic and the national home of the Jewish people. Working in American politics and the Jewish community, we advocate policies that advance shared US and Israeli interests as well as Jewish and democratic values, leading to a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. As Americans, we advocate in Washington and in national politics for American policy that advances diplomatic resolution of Israel's conflicts with its neighbors. Within the American Jewish community, we advocate that our institutions and leaders ground our relationship with Israel in the same values they apply to other issues, including freedom, justice and peace â€“ the very principles set forth in Israel's Declaration of Independence.
