United Way of Central Maryland (UWCM) improves people's lives by addressing health and human service problems facing Baltimore City and Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Carroll, Harford and Howard counties. It supports dozens of effective and efficient programs focused on the following: (1) Education - Children enter kindergarten ready to learn and youth graduate as self-sufficient adults; (2) Income - Families find and secure safe, stable and permanent housing; (3) Health - People are free from violence and abuse. Also, through 2-1-1 Maryland at United Way, the organization provides a direct community service which connects callers 24/7 to 4,200 community resources available to them. UWCM also mobilizes volunteers for short- and long-term projects and is a vocal advocate at the local, state and federal levels.
