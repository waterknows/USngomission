Make-A-Wish Foundation of Wisconsin grants the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions to enrich the human experience with hope, strength and joy. The Wisconsin chapter was founded in 1984 and has granted more than 5,300 wishes since that time. The chapter covers the entire state of Wisconsin with the help of two regional offices in Appleton and Madison. Last year, the chapter granted 351 Wisconsin wishes. This year alone, more than 500 Wisconsin children will be diagnosed with a life-threatening medical condition, and currently, more than 330 Wisconsin children are in the process of having their special wishes granted. According to a National Study, a wish come true helps children feel stronger, more energetic, more willing and able to battle their life-threatening medical conditions. For many of them it marks a turning point in the fight against their illness.
