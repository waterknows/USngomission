The mission of The Children's Museum of Atlanta (CMA) is to spark imagination and inspire discovery and learning for all children through the power of play. CMA has a rich history, beginning in 1988, as a virtual "Museum without Walls", providing educational programming, in collaboration with other organizations, to schools and nonprofit organizations. Since the opening of our permanent facility in 2003, CMA has established itself as a community resource in the heart of downtown Atlanta. The Museum features bright, creative, hands-on exhibits designed to spark discovery, inventive problem solving, creative thinking and artistic expression. The Museum receives 200,000 guests annually and has welcomed over 1.7 million visitors to date. Through free admission programs, subsidized field trips, camp scholarships and other outreach initiatives, we are dedicated to ensuring access to children, families and school groups regardless of their ability to pay.
