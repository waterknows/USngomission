Second Harvest Food Bank of Santa Clara and San Mateo Counties' service area stretches from South San Francisco to Gilroy and from the ocean to the bay.From July 2012 through June 2013, we provided food to an average of more than 250,000 individuals each month, making us the single largest non-profit provider of food to low-income people in our service area. Of those we serve, the majority are families with dependent children and senior citizens.In that period, we provided nearly 52 million pounds of food to those in need through our direct distribution programs and our network of over 300 partner nonprofit agencies.
