It is the mission of the Virginia Beach Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (VBSPCA) to create a more humane and responsible community by decreasing our tolerance for cruelty while increasing our capacity for compassion. Founded in 1966, the VBSPCA takes in and cares for almost 4,000 homeless domestic animals each year. Our outreach and humane education programs serve almost 28,000 children each year through our Listening Ears, Compassion Classroom, Autistic Bridges, Vet for a Day and Critter Camps. We provide services in 52 elementary schools in Virginia Beach, Chesapeake and Norfolk. As the only humane organization to hold a state and federal permit for the rehabilitation and release of wildlife, we take in nearly 2,200 wildlife animals annually and provide rescue and referral to another 1,500. Our Low Cost Medical Clinic provides affordable spay/neuter services as well as routine veterinary care to households earning less than $45,000 per year. Our mobile medical unit, the Neuter Scooter, extends sterilization and vaccination services to animals in other communities.
