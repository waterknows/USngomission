Restoration Ministries' mission is to restore hope to people while bringing lasting change to the community. We have youth development programs for at-risk, underprivileged youth. These programs include Homework Help & Tutoring, Kids Cafe, Bread for the Head Reading Program, Chess Club, the Harvey Boxing Club, a visual and performing arts center, and Summer Day Camp. We also operate two free Christian-based 18-month residential programs for men and women with histories of addiction, and a food pantry and assistance programs for families, individuals and senior citizens struggling in poverty. In addition, we have two thrift stores that provide revenue for our organization and job training and employment for residents of our recovery programs.
