Show Hope is a ministry that enables individuals and communities to change the world for orphans by not only addressing a child's need for food, shelter, care, and spiritual nourishment, but by also addressing the root issue for an orphan: the lack of a family. Established in 2003 as Shaohannah's Hope, Steven Curtis Chapman and his wife, Mary Beth initially founded Show Hope out of their desire to see more children find their way into forever families. From a six-story caring facility in China, equipped to provide surgeries and medical care to special needs orphans, to multiplying the effects of the adoption grant program by assisting churches in setting up their own adoption funds, Show Hope continues to expand in its remarkable worldwide impact.
