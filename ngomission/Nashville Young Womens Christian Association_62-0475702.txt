It is the vision of the YWCA of Nashville & Middle Tennessee to focus on women and girls who desire to create a better quality of life for themselves and/or their families, to achieve self-sufficiency, and to increase their financial strength. The YWCA will also be a spokesperson for those women who have no voice. Further, we will raise the awareness and diminish the incidence of violence and racism.
