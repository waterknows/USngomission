CitySquare (formerly Central Dallas Ministries) fights the causes and effects of poverty through service, advocacy, and friendship. Working together as a community, we feed the hungry, heal the sick, house the homeless and renew hope in the heart of our city. Working hand in hand with our neighbors - we do not have clients - we develop sustainable partnerships that provide support and encouragement to all so that everyone has the opportunity to achieve their full potential.
