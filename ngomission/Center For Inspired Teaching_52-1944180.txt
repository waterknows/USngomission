Center for Inspired Teaching is building a better school experience for children through innovative teacher training. When students learn not just what to think but how to think, they will succeed in the classroom today and in college and careers tomorrow. Through professional development courses, in-classroom mentoring, and district partnerships, our research-based program challenges teachers to revisit their assumptions, personal philosophies, and beliefs about teaching and how children learn.
