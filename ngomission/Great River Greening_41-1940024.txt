Great River Greening leads and inspires community-based restoration of natural areas and open spaces. Our restoration efforts help preserve natural areas, protect clean air and water, and increase urban residents' access to natural areas and sustainable open space. Since 1995, we have engaged nearly 20,000 volunteers in projects on both public and private land that conserve critical land habitat and affect water quality. By mobilizing and educating citizens to restore woods, prairies, and other natural resources in their communities, we are building a community of individuals who will be good stewards of these natural areas in the future. Overall, we have established partnerships with more than 400 landowners, businesses, nonprofits, and government agencies.
