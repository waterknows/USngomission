Cornerstone Schools of Alabama was founded in 1993 by the late C. Molton Williams and area business and community leaders. These leaders sought to end the cycle of poverty that goes hand in hand with an inadequate education. The mission of Cornerstone Schools is to provide Birmingham's urban children a Christ-centered environment of excellence in learning, character development, fine arts, and service to community. Cornerstone recognizes the unique challenges facing today's urban families and provides the tools and resources necessary for children to develop to their fullest potential while supporting parents in nurturing their child's personal and spiritual growth, enhancing self-esteem, and teaching personal responsibility.
