The mission of the American Lung Association is to save lives by improving lung health and preventing lung disease. The American Lung Association of California takes an integrated approach to preventing lung disease and promoting lung health through advocacy, education and research. We are the only organization in California that helps people and communities improve lung health while working to create public policies that attack the causes of lung disease. As one of the leading environmental health advocates, we fight for commonsense policies to reduce both indoor and outdoor air pollution, address urgent public health issues like the asthma epidemic and spread of tuberculosis, and against the predatory tactics of Big Tobacco. We offer education and support services to help people with lung disease live quality lives and prevent others from ever getting it.
