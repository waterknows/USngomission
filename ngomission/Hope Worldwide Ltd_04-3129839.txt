HOPE worldwide's vision is to bring hope and change lives. We are a faith-based international charity that serves the poor and needy through sustainable, high-impact, community-based services on a non-sectarian basis. With a global pool of committed staff and volunteers, HOPE worldwide annually serves more than a million needy people on all six inhabited continents. We treat the sick, feed the hungry, house the homeless, comfort the downcast, educate the poor and provide loving homes for the abandoned. Our work is produced by faith, prompted by love and inspired by hope.
