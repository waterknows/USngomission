Storyteller Children's Center provides quality, tuition-free early childhood education for homeless and at-risk children, as well as comprehensive support services for their families. Storyteller families are our community's most vulnerable. Children suffer from poverty, inadequate housing, domestic violence, parental substance abuse and other risk factors. Without intervention and therapy, experts know that early childhood traumas like these can have a tremendous impact on brain development. Storyteller teachers and staff provide a stable, nurturing environment so both children and families can feel safe and secure while they work toward a better life.
