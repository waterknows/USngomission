The mission of Carolina Children's Home (CCH) is to meet the underserved mental and physical health needs of children, young adults, and their families. We support this with a range of prevention and treatment programs that provide tools and support for maximizing individual potential and transitioning to healthy adulthood. Carolina Children's Home, once an orphanage is now an accredited residential treatment facility and group home dedicated to the care and needs of today's child. We are proud to offer a full continuum of programs and services to meet the needs of children and families. The majority of the children who reside in one of the residential programs or receive services may have been the victim of abuse, neglect, and/or abandonment.
