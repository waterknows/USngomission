Founded in 1988, Good Works addresses the substandard housing issues throughout Chester County, PA. Our program uses volunteers from the community to help low-income homeowners right in their backyards. We transform substandard houses into warmer, safer, drier homes, and despair into hope. We serve families in 49 of the 73 municipalities that make up Chester County through staging sites in Coatesville, West Chester, Phoenixville, and St. Peters. Applicants must own and live in the home, participate in repairs (as possible), have property taxes paid to date, and meet income guidelines. Most of the homeowners we assist are elderly, single parents, or individuals with disabilities. Our services are provided at no cost and volunteers do most of the repairs.Substantially improving a home's physical condition makes it possible for the family to keep and remain in the home. Without Good Works intervention, many of these families risk losing their homes completely.
