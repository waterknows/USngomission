The Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) is a membership organization located in Northern California that conducts and sponsors leading-edge research into the potentials and powers of consciousness - including perceptions, beliefs, attention, intention, and intuition. IONS explores phenomena that do not necessarily fit conventional scientific models, while maintaining a commitment to scientific rigor. Through our publications, events, and educational media, we inform our members and the public about the findings of our frontier research on consciousness and its relationship to the physical world. We honor open-minded approaches and multiple ways of knowing, bring discernment to our work, and support diversity of perspectives on social and scientific matters.
