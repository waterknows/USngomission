The Kelly Anne Dolan Memorial Fund advocates for families with seriously ill, physically and cognitively challenged, or severely injured children nationwide through information and education. We provide financial assistance for needs not covered by insurance to families whose children are living in or cared for in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, or Delaware. Families in crisis are referred to us by an extensive network of social workers, case managers, physical therapists, and other healthcare professionals in hospitals, medical facilities, social service agencies, and treatment centers. We have assisted more than 23,000 families since our founding in 1976. Our programs help strengthen families, improve their quality of life, and promote self-sufficiency.
