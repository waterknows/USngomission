Founded in 1971, Help Hospitalized Veterans' (HHV) mission is to provide veteran patients of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and military facilities with activities that keep their hands active and their minds alert while assisting in their recoveries. Arts and crafts kits along with other therapeutic products and services HHV provides, come as a very welcome assurance to veteran patients that they have not been forgotten - that someone out there really does care. With increased demand for services placed upon the VA and military hospital systems, HHV's programs focus on augmenting their delivery of services and support to the veterans.
