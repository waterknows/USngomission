Founded in 1889, San Francisco Zoo connects people with wildlife, inspires caring for nature and advances conservation action. We designed the Zoo with the underlying belief that interaction and activity lead to conservation action. We hope that caring for specific animals will inspire people to care for all wildlife and that this is the first step in the journey to becoming a conservationist. The San Francisco Zoo is a multi-faceted place: a recreation area where people can relax and have fun; a center for wildlife that provides exemplary care for rare and endangered species; a community organization serving the people of the Bay Area; an educational center providing formal and informal learning programs for children and adults; a park and nature center showcasing native plants and gardens and a bird sanctuary and bird watcher's paradise.
