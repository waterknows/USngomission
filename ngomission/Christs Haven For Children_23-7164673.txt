Established in 1954, Christ's Haven for Children (CHFC) provides a warm, loving, Christian environment in which children in need of basic care can grow physically, emotionally, and spiritually to become productive citizens in society. The Christ's Haven for Children campus is located on 156 beautiful acres in Keller, TX, north of Fort Worth. In addition to our administrative offices, we have seven child-care homes, a chapel, pavilion, gymnasium, workshop, barn, swimming pool, sport courts, and multiple playgrounds. The home cares for 40 children on the campus as well as children in foster care. The children receive medical and dental care, counseling, and tutoring as needed in a warm and loving home under the care and guidance of full-time house parents.
