Missionary Aviation Repair Center (MARC) supports rural missionaries, churches, and bible camps with aviation transportation services, training, and quality airplane maintenance. We have provided a lifeline of hope to these villages, strengthened the ministry of Christians, and expanded the reach of the Gospel across the Alaskan frontier since 1964. MARC has a fleet of airplanes that fly throughout western Alaska and even across the Bering Sea into eastern Russia. In 2012, our combined ministry team flew 2,521 passengers and 298,677 pounds of cargo, making 841 stops in 82 different communities in direct support of 71 churches, missionaries, and Christian outreach organizations, making a real difference in these communities of 81,000 people.
