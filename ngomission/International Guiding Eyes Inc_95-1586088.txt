Guide Dogs of America, founded in 1948 under the name International Guiding Eyes, is dedicated to providing guide dogs and instruction in their use, free of charge, to blind and visually impaired men and women from the United States and Canada so that they may continue to pursue their goals with increased mobility and independence. Guide Dogs of America has three main programs: the breeding program, the puppy raising program, and the guide dog program. We also provide advocacy services and follow-up free of charge for our graduates. A third service we provide is public education through our web site, tour and speaker programs, and by providing information upon request to help educate business or individuals about access laws and guide dogs.
