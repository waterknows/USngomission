At Greater Ottawa County United Way, our mission is to improve the quality of life for all Ottawa County residents by identifying pressing community challenges and focusing the community's collective power and resources to address those needs. Our vision is to create lasting change in the health & human services realm through the LIVE UNITED and "Community Impact" models. United Way has been making a difference in Ottawa County for nearly a century. Known in the 1920s as United Fund or Community Chest, annual fund drives to address community needs were a fixture of life in many communities in Ottawa County.
