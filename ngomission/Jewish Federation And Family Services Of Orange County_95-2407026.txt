Jewish Federation & Family Services (JFFS) offers an array of programs, services and grants, as well as opportunities for community engagement. JFFS supports projects in Orange County, California, in Israel, and around the Jewish world; programs and services in Orange County serve people of all faiths, ethnicities and ages. Its mission is to bring together the people, the partners and the resources to care for people in need, to build a vibrant community, and to sustain and enhance Jewish life. JFFS observes its 50th Anniversary in 2015-16, having been created in 1965 as the Jewish Federation Council of Orange County. In 2011, then-Jewish Federation merged with Jewish Family Service of Orange County to form what is now JFFS.
