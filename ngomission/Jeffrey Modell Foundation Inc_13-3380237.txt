The Jeffrey Modell Foundation was established by Vicki and Fred Modell in memory of their son Jeffrey, who died at the age of 15 of pneumonia due to an underlying Primary Immunodeficiency (PI) disease. The Foundation is dedicated to early and precise diagnosis, meaningful treatments, and ultimately cures of the ever increasing known PI Diseases. Our focus is: to affirm our absolute commitment to clinical and basic research in order to better understand and treat PI; to serve as a national and international source for the dissemination of information and education into the diagnosis and treatment of genetic immunodeficiencies; to serve as an advocate on behalf of patients and families to assure their access to excellent and comprehensive care; and to promote public awareness of the PI diseases through programs.
