Founded in 2005, Clear Horizons Academy works to build brighter futures for children with autism and to help each child acquire the skills they need to succeed in life. At Clear Horizons Academy, each child is the beneficiary of a tailored educational program that integrates speech, behavioral and occupational therapies designed to meet their individual learning and developmental needs. Clear Horizons also offers additional resources for parents and teachers to improve their own skills in working with children diagnosed with this disorder.
