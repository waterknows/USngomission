Coro New York Leadership Center is New York City's premier leadership training program and a community of 2,200 alumni across business, government, schools and non-profits that is shaping NYC's future. Coro's programs have developed one of the most diverse and impactful leadership communities in the city. We are the entrepreneur who founded Hot Bread Kitchen to train immigrant men and women to work in professional kitchens; the New York City Council Member who grew up in public housing and is now fighting for tenant rights; and the high school students who advise the Chancellor and her staff to create more effective education policies.  All came away from Coro with a deeper understanding of how policy is shaped, the skills to lead change in their organizations and communities, and a network of engaged and influential alumni to help them reach their goals.
