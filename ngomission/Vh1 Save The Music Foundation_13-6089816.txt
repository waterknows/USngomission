The VH1 Save The Music Foundation was founded in 1997 as a public affairs initiative of the VH1 network. The Foundation's core mission is to restore instrumental music education programs, ensuring that every child has access to a complete education that includes the benefits of music instruction. Since its inception, The Foundation has remained faithful to and focused on making our mission come to life. The VH1 Save The Music Foundation has proudly restored over 1,850 instrumental music programs in more than 192 school districts nationwide, putting instruments into the hands of 2.1 million children.
