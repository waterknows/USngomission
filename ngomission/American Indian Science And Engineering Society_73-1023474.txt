The mission of the American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES) is to substantially increase the representation of American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, First Nations and other indigenous peoples of North America in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) studies and careers. Since 1977, AISES has worked to substantially increase American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, First Nations and other indigenous peoples of North America representation in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields - as students, professionals, mentors, and leaders. AISES employs a "full circle of support" model that begins with pre-college programs, progresses into collegiate life, and then into the professional years of members and on into retirement.
