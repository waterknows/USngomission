The Race to Erase MS is dedicated to the treatment and ultimate cure of multiple sclerosis (MS). Funding research is the core focus of the foundation and significant strides have been made to find the cause and the cure of this devastating disease. All funds raised support our Center Without Walls program, a selected network of the nation's top MS research centers. This nationwide collaboration of physicians, scientists and clinicians are on the cutting-edge of innovative research programs and therapeutic approaches to eradicate MS. In addition to combating MS through research, the foundation hopes an increased awareness will be created by educating the public about this mystifying disease.
