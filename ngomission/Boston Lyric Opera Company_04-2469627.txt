The mission of Boston Lyric Opera is to build curiosity, enthusiasm, and support for opera, by creating musically and theatrically compelling productions, events, and educational resources, for our community and beyond. We produce opera in all forms, large to small, popular to less known, from early music to newly commissioned works.Boston Lyric Opera is New England's largest opera company. Founded in 1976, BLO is recognized for its artistically excellent productions of a diverse repertoire that entertain and inspire audiences and feature emerging operatic talent. BLO produces four mainstage productions each season: three at the Citi Performing Arts Center Shubert Theatre in Boston and an Opera Annex production in an alternative space outside the traditional opera theatre. BLO's programs are funded, in part, by grants from the Massachusetts Cultural Council and the National Endowment for the Arts.
