Coming Home Network's mission is to share the truth and beauty we have discovered in the Catholic faith and to provide mutual fellowship, encouragement, and support to all men and women who have become Catholic or who are newly exploring the Catholic Church. In particular, The Coming Home Network seeks to assist non-Catholic clergy who often face acute difficulties and struggles during their journeys.
