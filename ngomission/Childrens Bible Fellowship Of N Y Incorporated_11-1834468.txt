For over 60 years the camp ministry at Children's Bible Fellowship of New York has been a central part of our goal to make disciples of New York's forgotten fields. Every summer we run two vastly different programs on our beautiful 200 acre Carmel, New York campus. Camp Joy, the older of the two camps, caters to the needs of inner city children from New York City. Camp Hope specializes in meeting the needs of disabled campers from the New York metropolitan area. Children's Bible Fellowship also runs Project Genesis, a partnership program for individuals, church groups and students to share in the ministry God has given us.
