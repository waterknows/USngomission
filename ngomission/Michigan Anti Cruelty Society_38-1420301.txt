Since 1935, the Michigan Anti-Cruelty Society (MACS) has dedicated its efforts to providing refuge to stray, injured, and forgotten animals. We work to promote humane education and actively initiate affirmative legislative action. Each year, MACS investigates between 1,200 and 1,500 animal cruelty complaints and provides extensive sheltering organizations and pet adoption to the 13,000 animals who pass through the shelter doors. We never turn away an animal in need.
