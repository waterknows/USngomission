The mission of the Flynn Center for the Performing Arts is to foster the enjoyment, understanding, and development of the performing arts in Vermont and the region. The Center is a full-service home for the performing arts in the region; offers a wide range of cultural and educational experiences to our community; and nurtures the creative development of new national and local performing artists. Events presented by the Flynn are carefully selected from among the finest performers and performances in the world; our educational programs connect audiences with the performing arts through a wide range of activities. The Flynn provides a well-equipped and managed home for the arts and services that include a box office, ushers (Flynn Spirits), concessions, and professional crew.
