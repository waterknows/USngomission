For over 40 years, Audio Scripture Ministries (ASM) has facilitated the recording and distribution of Scripture recordings in hundreds of countries world wide. We work with Bible translators, missionaries, national ministries and others who recognize the need for Scriptures in audio format. We also work to enable effective and efficient use of any technical tools available to people can listen to God's Word in their heart language. ASM funds approved technical projects (recording equipment and/or audio listening devices) enabling missionaries to focus on the actual project, not funding. We also configure systems for specific recording projects. Additionally, we help by providing appropriate playback equipment, training and strategy in the best medium for a specific field.
