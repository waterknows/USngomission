Goodcity was founded in 1986 by Rev. William (Bud) Ipema as MidAmerica Leadership Foundation around the idea that many community leaders have the drive and faith commitment to make a difference, but lack the skills and access to resources that can make their visions real. Goodcity addresses that deficit by providing consultation, financial management and skills training for local leaders - empowering residents to address local needs efficiently and effectively. The mission of Goodcity is to support emerging neighborhood and faith-based programs which promote self-sufficiency, hope, and a sense of purpose in the lives of individuals in under-resourced communities.
