Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) uses medicine and science to stop mass atrocities and severe human rights violations against individuals. We use our investigations and expertise to advocate for the:* Prevention of individual or small scale acts of violence from becoming mass atrocities* Protection of internationally-guaranteed rights of individuals and civilian populations* Prosecution of those who violate human rightsPHR was founded in 1986 on the idea that health professionals, with their specialized skills, ethical duties, and credible voices, are uniquely positioned to stop human rights violations. Today, our expertise is sought by the United Nations, international courts, and regional groups like the African Union and the European Union. We are supported by the expertise and passion of health professionals and concerned citizens alike. In 1997, we shared the Nobel Peace Prize for the International Campaign to Ban Landmines.
