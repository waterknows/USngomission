Junior Achievement of Arizona's mission is to educate and inspire young people to value free enterprise, business and economics so as to improve the quality of their lives. We have been educating K-12 students about entrepreneurship, work readiness, and financial literacy since 1957. We are a member of Junior Achievement USA, which was founded in 1919 and originally called the Boys' and Girls' Bureau Committee. Currently, the Junior Achievement of Arizona has offices in Tempe and Tucson and engages over 90,000 students throughout the state with in-school and after school programs.
