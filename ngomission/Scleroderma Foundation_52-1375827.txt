The Scleroderma Foundation (SF) is the national organization for people with scleroderma and their families and friends. It was formed in 1998 by a merger between the West Coast-based United Scleroderma Foundation and the East Coast-based Scleroderma Federation. The Foundation helps patients and their families cope with scleroderma through mutual support programs, peer counseling, physician referrals, and educational information. We promote public awareness and education through patient and health professional seminars, literature, and publicity campaigns. The Foundation also stimulates and supports research to improve treatment and ultimately find the cause of and cure for scleroderma and related diseases.
