Founded in 1939, Leader Dogs for the Blind provides dog guides to people who are blind or visually impaired to enhance their mobility, independence and quality of life. Each year, over 270 students attend our 26-day residential training program to be paired with a dog guide. This is a life-changing event that opens the doors to independence, safety and self-worth for many of our students. In addition to our dog guide program, we offer programs that enhance a person's independence and quality of life in other ways, including orientation and mobility training, Trekker training, and seminars for Orientation and Mobility professionals. Currently, Leader Dog is the only facility in the Western Hemisphere to teach Deaf-blind students to work with a dog guide.
