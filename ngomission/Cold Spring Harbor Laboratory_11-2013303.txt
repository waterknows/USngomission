Founded in 1890, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) is a private institution with research programs in cancer, neuroscience, plant genetics, genomics, and bioinformatics and a broad educational mission. We are at the forefront of efforts in molecular biology and genetics to generate knowledge that will yield better diagnostics and treatments for cancer, neurological diseases and other major causes of human suffering. Each year 8,000 of the world's leading life scientists attend CSHL's legendary Meetings and Courses program and seminal Banbury conferences. The CSHL Press publishes textbooks, laboratory manuals, and research journals that are among the most highly cited in their fields.
