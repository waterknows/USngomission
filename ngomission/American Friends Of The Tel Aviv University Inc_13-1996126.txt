Tel Aviv University's American Friends are a worldly and intellectually sophisticated group, committed to nurturing higher education and developing Israel's best minds. We offer a stimulating variety of cultural, social and educational activities throughout the year, at venues across the country: special briefings, international conferences, intimate get-togethers and more formal events. We serve as a dynamic bridge between two inspired communities, American and Israeli, dedicated to excellence in scholarship and to strengthening Israel and the vital city of Tel Aviv.
