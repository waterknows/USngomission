Amigos For Kids was founded in 1991 to create awareness and obtain support from the burgeoning Hispanic community in South Florida. Today, Amigos For Kids has evolved into a mainstream non-profit and its child abuse prevention message now reaches communities across the country - no matter their ethnicity or native language. Our mission is to prevent child abuse and neglect by valuing children, strengthening families and educating communities.
