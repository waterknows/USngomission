Family Matters is a non-profit ministry whose goal is to see families transformed by God's grace into instruments of restoration and reformation by equipping families for every age and stage of life. We view families as the foundation of a successful society. Today, perhaps more than ever before, the family is being fragmented and undermined by many counter-forces such as busyness, relentless change, a lack of clear moral values, an attitude of indifference, and children being forced to grow up too fast. When families are unhealthy, our communities suffer many of the consequences in areas relating to economic productivity, education, law enforcement, health care needs, abuse, and violence.
