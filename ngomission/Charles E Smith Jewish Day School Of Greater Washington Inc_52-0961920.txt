The Charles E. Smith Jewish Day School of Greater Washington is an independent, community day school, serving students from kindergarten through twelfth grade. The School is dedicated to creating an environment in which students can grow to their fullest potential as responsible and dedicated members of the Jewish people, and of American society. Based on six basic Jewish precepts, the mission of our School is to teach its students: Torah L'Shmah, Ahavat Torah, K'dushah, Ahavat Yisrael, V'ahavta L'Rayakha and Tikun Olam.
