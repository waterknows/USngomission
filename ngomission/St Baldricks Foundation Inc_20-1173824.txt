St. Baldrick's Foundation began in 2000 as a challenge between friends and has since grown into the world's largest volunteer-powered, donor centered fundraising program for childhood cancer research. The Foundation now funds more in childhood cancer research grants than any organization except the U.S. government. Its signature head-shaving events are coordinated worldwide, where volunteers get bald to stand in solidarity with kids with cancer and raise money to support lifesaving research. Since its start, nearly 400,000 shavees, including over 51,000 women, have shaved their heads at more than 9,700 head-shaving events in 28 countries and 50 U.S. states. St. Baldrick's has committed more than $178 million since 2005 to fund local institutions as well as cooperative research on a national scale to help doctors work together to develop the best treatments for all children with cancer.
