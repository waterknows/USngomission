Since its founding in 1904, the Humane Society of New York has been a presence in New York City, caring for animals in need when illness, injury or homelessness strikes. Today our hospital and our Vladimir Horowitz and Wanda Toscanini Horowitz Adoption Center help more than 30,000 dogs and cats annually, and their numbers continue to grow. The Society has long been noted for its innovative, highly individualized approach to animal care; its pioneer attitude is now reflected in programs coming to the fore nationwide. On any given day the Society is responsible for hundreds of animals with diverse needs. For many, the Society is the only place they will find help.
