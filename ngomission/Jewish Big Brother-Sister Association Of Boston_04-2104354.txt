At Jewish Big Brothers Big Sisters of Greater Boston (JBBBS), we help to connect children in need to adult mentors, and we introduce adults who have disabilities to new friends in their communities. In this way, and in the spirit of chazak v'nithazaik (strengthening one another), we seek to support and empower individuals and families to engage, to participate actively in the life of their communities, to live inspired and to inspire others that none may be lost to us. Jewish Big Brothers Big Sisters of Greater Boston was founded in 1919.
