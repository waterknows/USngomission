Founded in 1936 as the Antiquarian & Landmarks Society, we are a state-wide network of twelve significant historic properties that span three centuries of New England history. Our museums are starting points, "landmarks in every sense," for deeper exploration and greater appreciation of the Connecticut experience. We have something for everyone: from captivating house tours to lovely historic gardens, history celebrations and remarkable collections of art and antiques. Our real-life stories, as told through our collections, make history matter. Connecticut Landmarks, connects you to Connecticut's past - one great place at a time.
