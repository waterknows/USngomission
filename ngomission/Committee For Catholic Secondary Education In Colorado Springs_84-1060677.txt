Established in 1885 as the Loretto Academy, St. Mary's High School is an academic community modeled on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ and the living tradition of the Catholic Church. This community challenges and empowers students to: grow in mind, body, and spirit, respecting the dignity of all; master the skills and knowledge for the next phase of their development, primarily a college education; and become responsible, ethical decision-makers in a diverse, complex world. Our vision is to be southern Colorado's leader in educating a diverse student body to become moral leaders for tomorrow.
