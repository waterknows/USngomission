The Delaware Museum of Natural History opened to the public in 1972 to excite and inform people about the natural world through exploration and discovery. As the only natural history museum in the state, the Museum welcomes more than 75,000 visitors each year to experience an African watering hole, gaze up at a giant squid, encounter a jaguar face-to-face, and marvel at the diversity of shells from around the globe. Gallery highlights also include the only permanent dinosaur collection in Delaware, a simulated coral reef, and a Science in Action paleontology lab. Throughout the year the Museum also hosts several special exhibits on national tour.
