The mission of the National Steinbeck Center is to tell the story of John Steinbeck's rich legacy and to present, create and explore stories of the human condition. Located in John Steinbeck's hometown of Salinas, the Center offers three distinct visitor experiences in literature and history, agriculture and art, as well special events and educational programs. In the John Steinbeck Exhibition Hall, literature jumps off the printed page and into your imagination. Discover Steinbeck's world through interactive, multisensory exhibits for all ages, rare artifacts, and seven themed theaters showcasing East of Eden, Cannery Row, Of Mice and Men, The Grapes of Wrath and much more. Explore the stories of the Salinas Valley from field to fork in the Rabobank Agriculture Museum, and enjoy changing art and cultural exhibits in the our multiple gallery spaces.
