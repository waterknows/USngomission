Founded in 1983, the Sjögren's Syndrome Foundation (SSF) provides patients with practical information and coping strategies that minimize the effects of Sjögren's syndrome. In addition, the Foundation is the clearinghouse for medical information and is the recognized national advocate for Sjögren's syndrome. The Foundation's mission is to: educate patients and their families about Sjögren's syndrome; increase public and professional awareness of Sjögren's syndrome; and to encourage research into new treatments and a cure. Sjögren's syndrome is a chronic autoimmune disease in which people's white blood cells attack their moisture-producing glands. Today, as many as four million Americans are living with this disease.
