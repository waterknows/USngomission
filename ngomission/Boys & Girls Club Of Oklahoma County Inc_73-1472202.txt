Boys & Girls Club of Oklahoma County inspires and enables all young people, especially those who need us most, to realize their full potential as productive, responsible and caring citizens. In every community, boys and girls are left to find their own recreation and companionship in the streets. An increasing number of children are at home with no adult care or supervision. Young people need to know that someone cares about them. The Boys & Girls Clubs of Oklahoma County offer that and more. Club programs and services promote and enhance the development of boys and girls by instilling a sense of competence, usefulness, belonging and influence.
