Middleton Outreach Ministry (MOM) was established in 1980 by a local church in the community to care for the basic needs of some of the area's residents. In 2007, with demand continuing to increase, MOM transitioned into a business-based organization both at the Board and leadership levels. Through the support of business partners, area schools and faith communities, as well as numerous individuals and service organizations, MOM provides - free of charge - food, clothing, housing assistance, emergency financial assistance, and special services for seniors. Together, MOM is leading a community-wide effort to prevent homelessness and end hunger for people throughout Middleton, West Madison and Cross Plains.
