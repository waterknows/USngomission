The Cape Eleuthera Foundation provides financial assistance for the furtherance of education at the Island School in Cape Eleuthera, Bahamas. The programs supported by the Cape Eleuthera Foundation continue to provide transformational life-changing educational experiences. The foundation invests in future leaders through support of programming to help them realize their own potential, to gain perspective on cultures different than their own, and by creating a broader community that is supportive of that leadership development. As a natural outgrowth of this process, whereby students are learning to live on a green campus powered by renewable energy and that recycles its waste, and whereby students from Eleuthera are realizing opportunities on-and-off island as part of their middle school training, and whereby ongoing science research is attracting expertise, generating knowledge, and informing local decision-makers we have been recognized as a model for sustainable development.
