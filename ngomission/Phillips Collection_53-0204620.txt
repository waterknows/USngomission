The Phillips Collection is an intimate museum combined with an experiment station. At its heart is an exceptional collection of modern and contemporary art around which the museum creates a dynamic environment for looking, learning, and enjoyment. Created by visionary Duncan Phillips, the museum has engaged artists, visitors, scholars, students and teachers with modern art in a profound and personal way for more than 85 years. While small in scale and focused in its exhibitions and programming, the Phillips is national and international in its reach and impact. With the new Center for the Study of Modern Art, the museum has become a lively forum for a global conversation about the visual expressions and ideas of today.
