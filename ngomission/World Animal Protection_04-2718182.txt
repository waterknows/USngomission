World Animal Protection seeks to create a world where animal welfare matters and animal cruelty has ended. We were known WSPA (World Society for the Protection of Animals). We are active in more than 50 countries, working directly with animals and with people and organizations that can ensure animals are treated with respect and compassion. We campaign effectively to combat the world's most intense and large-scale animal welfare issues, and we are the world leader in animal-focused disaster response and risk reduction. Locally, we improve animals' lives by working directly with communities and owners. Globally, we have Consultative Status at the Council of Europe and General Status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations. We partner with individuals, organizations, governments, humanitarian groups and international agencies across the world to show that animals matter.
