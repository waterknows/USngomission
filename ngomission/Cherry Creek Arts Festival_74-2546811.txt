The Cherry Creek Arts Festival's (CCAF) mission is to provide access to a broad array of arts experiences and support arts education in Colorado. The Arts Festival weekend event is a world-class and award-winning celebration of the visual, culinary and performing arts, and enjoys an attendance of 350,000 visitors over the course of the 3-day event. The CCAF gives patrons the FREE, rare and special opportunity to meet and talk with international visual artists, sample fine cuisine, enjoy live musical performances and artist demonstrations, and entertain their families with interactive â€˜ARTivities.' Along with the annual civic event, CCAF provides year-round mission-based art education and outreach programs in local area schools.
