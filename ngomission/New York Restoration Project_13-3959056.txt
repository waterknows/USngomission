Founded in 1995 by Bette Midler, the New York Restoration Project (NYRP) carries out Midler's dream of a cleaner, more beautiful New York. NYRP restores, develops, and revitalizes underserved parks, community gardens, and open space in New York City. We invest in the communities we serve by providing on-going maintenance and programs because we believe that every individual has the right to a beautiful neighborhood and the responsibility for contributing to its care. Now into our second decade, we've removed over 875 tons of garbage from project sites and reclaimed more than 400 acres of under-resourced and rundown parkland. We've rescued scores of community gardens from commercial development and served over 10,000 at-risk urban youngsters with free environmental education programs.
