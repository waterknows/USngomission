In 1983, Friends of Child Advocates, now CASA of Los Angeles, organized a public/private partnership to increase awareness and raise money for the recruitment, training and support of volunteer advocates for abused and neglected children under the care of the Dependency Court. The mission of CASA of Los Angeles is to improve the lives of foster children with trained volunteer advocates. A Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) is appointed by a judge to advocate for the best interests of a foster child. CASA seeks to reduce and reverse the effects of child abuse and neglect.
