OneSky (formerly Half the Sky) believes in the vast potential hidden in our world's most vulnerable children. We create and implement simple, replicable early learning programs that provide nurturing, responsive care, transforming the lives of thousands of at-risk children every day and ensuring that those most in need have a second chance at childhood.Founded in 1998 to provide care for institutionalized children in China, OneSky has learned over nearly two decades of work that the needs of young children are universal. OneSky is working toward large-scale, practical application of its innovative yet proven early childhood interventions models across multiple developing countries and for children living outside as well as inside orphanage walls. To date, OneSky has trained 14,000 caregivers to provide life-changing care for 130,000 children.
