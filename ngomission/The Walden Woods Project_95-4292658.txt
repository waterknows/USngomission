The Walden Woods Project preserves the land, literature, and legacy of the quintessential American author, philosopher, and naturalist, Henry David Thoreau, to foster an ethic of environmental stewardship and social responsibility. The Project achieves this mission through the integration of five important core activities: Conservation, scholarship, education, program activities, and advocacy/awareness. One word, Walden, has come to represent a powerful way of thinking about important global issues.
