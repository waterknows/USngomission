The Brother Benno Foundation, founded in 1983, is dedicated to distributing the generous gifts entrusted to it by the community, to serve and uplift the dignity of those in the community who are in vital need in North Coastal San Diego County. The goals of the Brother Benno Foundation are to see that, within the limits of our resources, no one in our area goes hungry, no one goes without shelter or clothing, and most importantly, no one goes without someone to care for him or her. We also strive to help our guests attain self-sufficiency. From the beginning, our founders decided to refer to the people they serve as guests instead of clients. Their choice of the word guest has been the underpinning of their entire philosophy, which is one of loving service and the belief that everyone has value and no one is a lost cause.
