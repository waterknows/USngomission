Founded in 1978, Wilderness Inquiry's mission is to provide equitable, inclusive access to the many benefits of the natural world for all communities. We do so through shared outdoor education and adventure programs that inspire personal development, enhanced environmental awareness, and community integration for people of all ages, abilities and backgrounds, including those marginalized from the mainstream. Over 37 years, WI, with its many partners, has pioneered innovative programs to serve over 411,000 people from all walks of life. Annually we offer over 400 experiences ranging from outdoor workshops at local community events to multi-day trips worldwide. WI adventures encourage people to open themselves to new possibilities and opportunities.
