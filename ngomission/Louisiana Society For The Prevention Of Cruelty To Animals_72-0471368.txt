The Louisiana SPCA advocates for the animals of Louisiana by advancing their welfare, promoting their interests, and fostering the human-animal bond through innovative programs, education, and service. We are committed to: providing shelter and temporary refuge to those animals who are homeless or are in need of respite from cruelty and neglect; finding forever families for adoptable animals; promoting and supporting positions that have a positive impact on the quality of life for animals; reuniting lost pets and their owners; eliminating overpopulation of animals through aggressive spaying/neutering and education; educating the public regarding responsible pet ownership and respect for animal life; securing basic medical services for animals in need; and reducing cruelty through stronger ordinances, investigations, partnerships, and education.
