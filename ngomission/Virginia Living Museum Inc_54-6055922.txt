In 1987, the Virginia Living Museum became the first living museum east of the Mississippi, combining the elements of a native wildlife park, science museum, aquarium, botanical preserve and planetarium. The exhibits showcase all of the state's regions from the upland coves of the Appalachian Mountains to the salty offshore waters of the Atlantic Ocean and feature more than 245 different animal species. The Museum's unique exhibits are also a vital component in its extensive education programming. The museum believes in hands-on education; that by experiencing science it will become memorable. More than two million students have visited the museum since 1987.
