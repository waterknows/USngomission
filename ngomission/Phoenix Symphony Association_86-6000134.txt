The vision of The Phoenix Symphony is to be the arts leader in the revitalization of a thriving Arizona. In ten years, The Phoenix Symphony will be a cultural icon and a reason people will like to live in Arizona whether they attend concerts or not. And, the Symphony will be one of the many compelling reasons people will want to move to Arizona. This will happen because our community will recognize that the Symphony provides unparalleled civic value. Our mission is to provide the joy of music as a catalyst in helping Arizona to become the best place in America to work and live. We accomplish this mission by creating high quality music experiences to feed the souls of our residents, to bolster the cultural economy and to educate and strengthen our next generation resulting in a creative workforce.
