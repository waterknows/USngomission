Founded in 1983, The INN (Interfaith Nutrition Network) addresses the issues of hunger and homelessness on Long Island by providing food, shelter and long-term housing and supportive services in a dignified and respectful manner for those who seek our help. We are a volunteer-based organization with a dedicated staff, a broad base of community support and a commitment to educate the public about these issues. Anyone who comes to The INN's soup kitchens receives a hot, nutritious meal, a warm welcome and access to whatever additional support services are available. The INN has a total of 14 soup kitchens (in 21 locations), operating as part of The INN's network across Long Island. More than 5,500 people are fed each week. The INN also has three Emergency Shelters and a Long Term Housing Program (23 housing sites).
