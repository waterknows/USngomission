A principal leader of Boston's arts community since 1815, the Handel and Haydn Society is dedicated to performing Baroque and Classical music at the highest level of artistic excellence and to sharing that music with as large and diverse an audience as possible through concert performances at Symphony and Jordan Halls, tours, recordings, radio broadcasts, and outreach initiatives for students and underserved communities.
