Founded in 1920, The Omaha Home for Boys is a privately funded youth care provider dedicated to supporting and strengthening youth and families with the majority of residents receiving care at no cost. The Home's Residential Care program provides a safe, structured living environment in a cottage setting with caring House Parents, balanced meals and educational support for boys ages 10 - 18 years. Each year more than 100 boys are taught basic behavioral, disciplinary and living skills. All youth attend public school. Additionally, over 50 young men and women who have aged-out of group home programs can continue to receive help as they are taught how to live independently and transition into adulthood through the Home's Independent Living program.
