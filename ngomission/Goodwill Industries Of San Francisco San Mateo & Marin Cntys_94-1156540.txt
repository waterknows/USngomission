Founded in 1916, Goodwill Industries of San Francisco, San Mateo and Marin Counties is dedicated to creating solutions to poverty through workforce creation and environmental stewardship. In the last year we put more than 600 people back to work and helped thousand more through job readiness programs. That means at-risk families not only remained intact but also moved from poverty toward self-reliance. Goodwill offers numerous employment programs and services designed to help people find a dignified path out of poverty through the power of work.
