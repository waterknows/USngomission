Since 1978, GroundSpark has produced and distributed films, educational resources and campaigns on issues ranging from environmental concerns to affordable housing to preventing prejudice. Our mission is to create visionary films and dynamic educational campaigns that move individuals and communities to take action for a more just world. Working closely with educators, activists, national and local organizations, we ensure that our films are used to inspire meaningful social change. GroundSpark's landmark program, The Respect For All Project, facilitates the development of inclusive, bias-free schools and communities by providing media resources, support and training to youth, educators and service providers.
