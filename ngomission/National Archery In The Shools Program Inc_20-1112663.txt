National Archery in the Schools Program promotes the teaching of target archery as a part of the in-school curriculum to improve educational performance of students and encourage their participation in the shooting sports. Some basic operating principles were established and implemented in twenty one pilot middle schools in Kentucky in March, 2002. These same operating principles remain constant today and account for the steady growth and continued interest in 12,000 schools in five countries. More than a million students will learn archery from their teachers this school year.
