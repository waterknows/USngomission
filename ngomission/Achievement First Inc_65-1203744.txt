Achievement First is a growing network of non-profit, high-performing, college-preparatory, K to 12 public charter schools. Originally established in 2003, Achievement First has grown into a network that includes 22 public charter schools in four cities. The mission of Achievement First is to deliver on the promise of equal educational opportunity for all of America's children. We believe that all children, regardless of race or economic status, can succeed if they have access to a great education. Achievement First schools provide all of our students with the academic and character skills they need to graduate from top colleges, to succeed in a competitive world and to serve as the next generation of leaders in our communities.
