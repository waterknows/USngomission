The Loomis Chaffee School is a New England boarding school located on a 300-acre campus in Windsor, Connecticut. Chartered in 1874 by five siblings whose children all died tragically and who then selflessly determined to found a school as a gift to the children of others, Loomis Chaffee provides a superb education for boys and girls regardless of religious or political beliefs, national origin or financial resources. Academically challenging, the school promotes active learning and close faculty-student bonds within a respectful and civil community. All Loomis Chaffee students, who come from 26 states and 20 countries, plan to attend four-year colleges and universities.
