The Wiregrass United Way was founded in 1938. We work throughout the year to raise awareness and funds for the community and our agencies. We coordinate workplace campaigns with hundreds of employers and advocate for positive change in the areas of education, income and health. Our goal is to create lasting changes that prevent problems from happening in the first place. We operate under the idea that when we reach out a hand to one, we can influence the condition of all.
