At the Center for Children and Families, Inc. (CCFI), we offer strength-based programs and services to aide and educate families coping with abuse, neglect, divorce, separation, teenage pregnancy, a lack of quality out-of-school care, and/or other adverse experiences. Since 1969, CCFI has partnered with schools, neighborhoods, donors, public agencies, and families to provide education, prevention, and treatment services for families because we believe that every boy and girl deserves to grow up safe, nurtured and loved.
