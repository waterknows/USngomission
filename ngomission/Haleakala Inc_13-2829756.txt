Founded as an artist collective in 1971, The Kitchen has from its infancy been a space where experimental artists and composers share progressive ideas with like-minded colleagues. The Kitchen is one of New York City's oldest nonprofit spaces, showing innovative work by emerging and established artists across disciplines. The Kitchen's programs range from dance, music, performance, and theater, to video, film, and art, in addition to literary events, artists' talks, and lecture series. It has been a powerful force in shaping the cultural landscape of this country, and has helped launch the careers of many artists who have gone on to worldwide prominence.
