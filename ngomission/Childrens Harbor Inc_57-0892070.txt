Ben and Luanne Russell began dreaming of building a place for children and families on Lake Martin in 1987. The dream became a reality in 1990 with the dedication ceremonies of Children's Harbor. From the beginning the mission was simple: strengthening children and families. Each year, at our Lake Martin campus, we partner with over 16 different groups who serve the seriously ill and the disabled to provide camping and adventure services to children with long-term serious illnesses and their families. In 2001 the Russells' commitment continued with their gift to build the state-of-the-art Children's Harbor Family Resource and Counseling Center at Children's Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama where we provide counseling, education, recreation, respite and other supportive services to these children and their families.
