In 1995, a small group of dedicated philanthropists established FJC, with the goal of making it the premier foundation of donor advised funds for discerning philanthropists who appreciate a better way of giving. FJC works to increase and maximize the impact of charitable dollars, create innovative philanthropic solutions, and respond effectively to the needs and interests of donors. To date, FJC has established over 1,000 donor advised fund accounts and manages over $255 million in assets. We have distributed over $270 million in grants to charities around the world. The FJC Agency Loan Fund (ALF) has advanced over $200 million in loans to 200 non-profit organizations globally
