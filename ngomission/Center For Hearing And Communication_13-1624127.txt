The Center for Hearing and Communication is committed to improving the quality of life for children and adults with all degrees of hearing loss and listening and auditory challenges. We work to make life better for people with hearing loss. We designed our services to help make sure hearing loss doesn't keep you from your full potential. Isolation, dropping out of the conversation—even lost earnings and health issues—are associated with hearing loss, but we don't believe they need to be. We accomplish our mission by providing hearing rehabilitation and human services for people who are hard of hearing or deaf, and their families, regardless of age, ability to pay, or mode of communication, and by empowering our clients to achieve their potential.
