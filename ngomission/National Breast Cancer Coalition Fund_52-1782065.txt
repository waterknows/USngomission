The National Breast Cancer Coalition Fund (NBCCF) supports the educational efforts of the National Breast Cancer Coalition. It empowers and trains advocates to be effective in every aspect of the fight to end breast cancer. NBCCF gives women the tools to make their own informed decisions and take a leadership role with legislative, scientific and clinical decision makers. NBCCF also helps guide the public through the maze of information on breast cancer. Project LEAD is one of the NBCCF's many programs. An innovative science program for breast cancer activists, Project LEAD offers courses that prepare advocates for participation in the wide range of forums where breast cancer research decisions are made.
