Detroit Police Athletic League (PAL) is a non-profit organization positively impacting the lives of more than 11,000 children each year. With roots dating back to 1969, our group works to create safe and supportive places for kids to play. We also train and certify more than 1,500 volunteers each year to become encouraging coaches and mentors to the city's youth. Detroit PAL's mission is to build character in young people through athletic, academic and leadership development programs and to help provide young people with the support and told necessary for them to achieve their highest potential as adults.
