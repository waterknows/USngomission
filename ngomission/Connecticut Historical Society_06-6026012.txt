Established in Hartford in 1825, the Connecticut Historical Society (CHS) is a museum, library, and education center. Our mission is to inspire and foster a life-long interest in history through exhibitions, programs and Connecticut-related collections because examining and understanding the past, and connecting the past with the present, provides a guide for the future. The museum's collections include more than 242,000 prints and photographs and 38,000 objects, with strengths in 17th and 18th century furniture; costume and textiles; portraits and landscapes; tavern and trade signs; decorative arts; and toys and tools. The library holds more than 125,000 volumes, 1,300 maps, 3,700 broadsides, and nearly three million manuscripts, including one of the nation's finest genealogical collections. CHS offers a wide range of educational programs for students in grades K through 12.
