Opened in 1986, the mission of the Vermont Foodbank is to gather and share quality food and nurture partnerships so that no one in Vermont will go hungry. Today the Vermont Foodbank, Vermont's only food bank, serves 280 sites that assist as many as 86,000 Vermonters each year. Last year, the Vermont Foodbank distributed more than 8 million pounds of food to its Network Partners around the state from its distribution centers in Barre, Brattleboro and Wolcott.
