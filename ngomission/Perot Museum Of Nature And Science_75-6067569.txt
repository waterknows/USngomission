Founded in 1968, the Perot Museum of Nature and Science exposes our children to a world of ideas and concepts in science, math and technology, all within one spectacular location. By offering hands-on ways to learn about scientific evidence, mathematical concepts and natural history, the Museum will profoundly affect what and how our kids experience science and nature. Future scientists, mathematicians and engineers will find inspiration and education through interactive exhibits, multimedia presentations and vivid contextual displays.
