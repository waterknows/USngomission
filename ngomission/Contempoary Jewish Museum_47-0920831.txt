The Contemporary Jewish Museum's (CJM) core purpose is to be an engaging forum for diverse audiences where new perspectives on Jewish culture, history, art, and ideas thrive. The CJM makes the diversity of the Jewish experience relevant for a twenty-first century audience. We accomplish this through innovative exhibitions and programs that educate, challenge, and inspire. Since its founding in 1984, the Contemporary Jewish Museum (CJM) has distinguished itself as a welcoming place where visitors can connect with one another through dialogue and shared experiences with the arts.
