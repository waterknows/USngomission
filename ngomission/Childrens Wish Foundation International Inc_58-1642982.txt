Founded in 1985, Children's Wish Foundation (CWFI) is committed to bringing joy and happiness to seriously ill children throughout the world and this dedication has created special experiences for children around the globe. Recognizing our families' needs outside of the scope of wish fulfillment, we stepped up our commitment to the children by developing hospital enrichment programs which place educational and entertainment materials in children's hospitals throughout the world as well as our Family Focus programs. To keep costs to a minimum, we operate with the efforts of a small staff and only one U.S. office, relying on a network of volunteers to act as our "hands and feet" in communities around the world. To date, CWFI has touched the lives of children in 53 countries, providing a lifetime of memories for them and their family.
