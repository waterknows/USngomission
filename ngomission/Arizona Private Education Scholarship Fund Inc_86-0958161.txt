The Arizona Private Education Scholarship Fund (APESF) is a School Tuition Organization developed under the guidelines provided in the AZ Private School Tuition Tax Credit Law of 1997. APESF was founded and incorporated in 1998 to provide educational scholarships to students attending private K-12 schools in the state of Arizona. APESF directs its support toward the student only, not the school. Therefore, all scholarships are awarded to the student applicant regardless of the qualified private school they have selected to attend.
