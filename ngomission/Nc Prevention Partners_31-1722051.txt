NC Prevention Partners works to reduce preventable illness and early death caused by tobacco use, poor nutrition and physical inactivity. Our mission is: prevention first for a healthier North Carolina. Founded in 1998, our work brings together leaders from business, health insurers, schools, hospitals, foundations, researchers, consumers, public health and advocacy organizations to improve health and control costs. Our ultimate goal is for all North Carolinians to have the opportunity to enjoy good health.
