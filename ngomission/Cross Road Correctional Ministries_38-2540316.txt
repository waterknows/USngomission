Crossroad Bible Institute equips the church to disciple people in prison with the Word of God, free of charge, wherever they are incarcerated. Millions of incarcerated persons in North America and beyond are in darkness and searching for a ray of hope. Now, more than ever, people in prison need the light of God's truth. That's why Crossroad Bible Institute has been working since 1984 to provide them with faith-based reentry education, to equip the church to make disciples, to guide our students into reentry agencies upon their release and to educate the church on criminal and restorative justice issues.
