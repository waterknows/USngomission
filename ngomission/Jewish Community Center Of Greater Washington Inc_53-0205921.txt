The Jewish Community Center of Greater Washington (JCCGW) is one of the largest metropolitan JCCs in the country. Our mission is to promote Jewish continuity and identity, and create community in an atmosphere of warmth and meaning. We inspire and connect people of all ages and backgrounds through educational, cultural and recreational opportunities in a welcoming and inclusive environment. The JCCGW was created in 1913 and incorporated in 1923. Today, the JCC's programs and facilities serve more than 2,500 people of varying backgrounds and ages each day. With more than 2,000 diverse programs, services and classes offered each year, every individual and family can create their own personal JCC experience.
