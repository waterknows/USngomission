The Botanical Garden Foundation is the membership organization that supports the North Carolina Botanical Garden, its mission, and its programs. The Foundation and its Board of Directors raise nearly 50 percent of the funds for operating expenses of the Garden. In addition, the Botanical Garden Foundation protects nearly 300 acres of land for conservation purposes. The North Carolina Botanical Garden is a unit of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The Garden furthers the University's mission of teaching, research, and public service through its own mission to inspire understanding, appreciation, and conservation of plants in gardens and natural areas and to advance a sustainable relationship between people and nature.
