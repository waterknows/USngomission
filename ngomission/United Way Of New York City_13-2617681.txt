United Way of New York City fights poverty throughout the five boroughs. We design and invest in evidence-based programs that ensure that low-income New Yorkers have both a safety net and a springboard to a better life. We rigorously evaluate our work and use lessons learned to advance citywide policies and practices that prevent and alleviate poverty by improving educational outcomes, strengthening financial stability, and promoting healthier lifestyles. Throughout our work, we partner with neighborhood organizations, government, business, foundations, volunteer and others so that collectively we can create change on a scale that no single organization can achieve on its own. We offer individuals and organizations diverse opportunities to give, advocate and volunteer to advance the common good.
