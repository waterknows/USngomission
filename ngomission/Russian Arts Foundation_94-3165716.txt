The Russian Arts Foundation is a US non-profit established in 1992 to promote international understanding through the arts. The Foundation is also assisting in the development of a tradition of private individual and corporate support of the arts within Russia. The arts offer a unique opportunity to deepen cross-cultural understanding, to bring the world closer through cultural exchange and education. The arts demonstrate and emphasize our common humanity, promoting globalism instead of isolationism, community instead of conflict. The Russian Arts Foundation is vigorously engaged in advancing these ideals through its many programs.
