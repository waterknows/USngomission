Founded in 1920, the United Way of Central Massachusetts' mission is to inspire and mobilize the caring power of our community to ensure that children, youth, families and those in need have the opportunity to become self-sufficient and successful members of society. United Way of Central Massachusetts has played a critical role in the local community by helping those in need. As community leaders, we convene local resources - donors, volunteers, partners and agencies to address the most critical human needs, and create a positive, measurable impact in the community. Our impact areas include: ensuring children's readiness for school; supporting positive youth development; and helping people most in need.
