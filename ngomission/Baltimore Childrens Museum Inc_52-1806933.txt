Port Discovery's mission is to connect purposeful play and learning. Activities and exhibits are based on the Museum's five learning initiatives: Early Childhood Learning, Healthy Families: Healthy Communities, STEM Learning (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics), Financial Literacy, and Creative Arts and Culture. Since opening in the historic Fish Market building in Downtown Baltimore in 1998, Port Discovery has served more than 3.7 million visitors.
