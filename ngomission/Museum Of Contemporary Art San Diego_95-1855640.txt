The mission of the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego (MCASD) is to serve diverse audiences through the exhibition, interpretation, collection, and preservation of art created since 1950. Founded in 1941, MCASD engages regional, national, and international audiences including the binational constituency of the San Diego/Tijuana region. Its vision is to provide public access to contemporary art, artists, and the creative process; be a forum for the exploration and understanding of contemporary art and ideas; and a laboratory for artists to experiment with new forms of creative expression. Located in the heart of downtown San Diego and in the coastal community of La Jolla, MCASD provides an unprecedented variety of exhibition spaces and experiences for the community, showcasing an internationally recognized collection and a dynamic schedule of exhibitions and public programs.
