Established in 1961 as Laguna Gloria Art Museum, the Austin Museum of Art (AMOA) is dedicated to developing and educating a broad audience for the visual arts in Austin, focusing primarily on 20th-century and contemporary art. AMOA presents and originates a broad range of exhibitions designed to appeal to a general audience as well as occasional shows of more challenging work. Lively interpretative programming emphasizes interdisciplinary connections between the visual arts and other art forms and creates connections to our lives today. With two locations to welcome our city and its visitors, AMOA presents an array of art experiences in the fun, informal, and collaborative spirit of Austin. As a community-oriented museum, we reflect the character and vibrancy of our city.
