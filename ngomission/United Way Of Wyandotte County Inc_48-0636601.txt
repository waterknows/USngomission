The United Way of Wyandotte County is one of nearly 1,400 community-based United Way associations across the United States and is governed by an independent board of 36 local community leaders and volunteers. The money we raise stays in Wyandotte County to support programs operated by non-profit social service agencies based in our community. The United Way of Wyandotte County funds programs that help meet basic needs, nurture children and families, and promote health and quality of life. Community volunteers are today, as always, our greatest asset. Volunteer leadership drives the United Way of Wyandotte County's mission to increase the community's understanding of human needs and mobilize resources to address those needs.
