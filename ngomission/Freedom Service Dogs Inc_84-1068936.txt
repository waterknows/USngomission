Freedom Service Dogs is a nonprofit organization that enhances the lives of people with disabilities by rescuing dogs and custom training them for individual client needs. Clients include children, veterans and active duty soldiers, and other adults. Their disabilities include Autism, Traumatic Brain Injury, Cerebral Palsy, Spinal Cord Injuries, Muscular Dystrophy, Multiple Sclerosis, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Unlike most service dog organizations, we rescue our dogs, not breed. Our dogs come from various parts of the country and we custom train them to become amazing service dogs. FSD does not have a puppy-breeding or raising program. Our experience is that there are plenty of unwanted dogs in shelters that are eager to get a second chance and a whole new career. Over the course of our 27+ years, we have found that with dedicated training these dogs become heroes to those with disabilities, transforming their lives forever.
