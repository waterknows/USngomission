Washington Policy Center (WPC) improves lives of Washington citizens by providing accurate, high-quality research for policymakers, the media and the general public. WPC is an independent, non-partisan, research and education organization located in Seattle, Washington, that publishes studies, sponsors events and conferences and educates citizens on public policy issues facing our region. We believe ideas, supported by sound research and promoted through publications, conferences and the media, over time, create an environment in which sound public policy decisions are made.
