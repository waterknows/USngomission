The Arizona Chapter works tirelessly to improve the quality of life for the 45,500 people affected by MS throughout Arizona. Our mission is to create a world free of multiple sclerosis. We have been serving the state of Arizona since 1956. During this time, our understanding of MS has increased, the services we are able to provide have grown and the research we help to fund has led to treatments and therapies where none existed only 15 years ago. We proudly serve over 8,000 Arizonans affected by MS.
