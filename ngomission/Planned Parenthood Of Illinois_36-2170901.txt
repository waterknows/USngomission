Planned Parenthood of Illinois (PPIL) is a trusted health care provider, an informed educator and a passionate advocate. PPIL's 18 health centers deliver vital health care services, sex education, and sexual health information to over 80,000 women, men, and young people each year. For more than 60 years, PPIL has promoted a commonsense approach to women's health and well-being, based on respect for each individual's right to make informed, independent decisions about sex, health, and family planning. Each health center provides safe, reliable services that prevent unintended pregnancies through contraception, reduce the spread of sexually transmitted infections through testing and treatment, and screen for cervical and other cancers.
