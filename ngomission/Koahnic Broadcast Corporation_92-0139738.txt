Koahnic Broadcast Corporation (KBC) is an Alaska Native governed and operated media center located in Anchorage, Alaska. "Koahnic" is an Athabascan word in the Ahtna dialect meaning "live air." The mission of KBC is to be the leader in bringing Native voices to Alaska and the nation. KBC pursues its mission through operation of three projects: National Programming, including Native-oriented programming for the entire public radio system; Koahnic Training Center, which provides workshops, youth programs, and internships to increase the number of Native people employed in media fields; and KNBA 90.3 FM, the first Native radio station located in an urban market.
