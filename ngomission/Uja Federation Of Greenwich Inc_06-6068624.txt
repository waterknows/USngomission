The UJA Federation of Greenwich is committed to the preservation, enrichment and continuity of the Jewish people and to the enhancement of Jewish life in Greenwich, North America, Israel, and throughout the world. Central to our mission is a community built on the Jewish ideal of tzedakah: charity, righteousness and social justice. It is our support for local programs, agencies and the humanitarian work of the United Jewish Communities, that enriches local, national and international Jewish life.
