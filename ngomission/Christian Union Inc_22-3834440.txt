Christian Union's mission is to transform our nation and world by developing and connecting bold Christian leaders. Christian Union's two main emphases on select universities and professionals in key cities reflect our concern to reach people groups that exert disproportionate cultural influence in the United States. Imagine our society and world transformed by the leadership and values of Christians of wholehearted devotion to the Lord. At present, these eight very influential universities export spiritual darkness into our culture through secularized leadership. It will take prayer, effort and financial resources to reach these future leaders for Christ.
