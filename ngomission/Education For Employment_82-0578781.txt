Education For Employment's (EFE) mission is to create economic opportunity for unemployed youth in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) by providing world-class professional and technical training that leads directly to jobs and entrepreneurship support. EFE is an affiliated network of locally-run non-profit organizations in MENA that provides youth with training in vocational and professional skills in high demand by the local labor market, and connects graduates to jobs. To promote job creation and an alternative pathway to economic opportunity, youth entrepreneurship programs are also being piloted. 



Graduates of our programs have access to the EFE alumni network, which offers opportunities for continuing professional development, civic engagement and leadership, mentoring, networking, and international exchange.



To broaden its impact for systemic change, we work with governments and public educational institutions to implement youth employability programs.

The EFE Network is comprised of locally-run affiliates in Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Palestine, Tunisia and Yemen, and a presence in the Gulf, and support organizations in Spain and the United States that support the regional affiliates.
