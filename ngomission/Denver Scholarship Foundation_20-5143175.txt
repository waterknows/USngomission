For many students in Denver, continuing their education beyond high school doesn't seem like a viable option. Most often, it's not low grades or lack of extracurricular activities keeping them from pursuing their dreams. There are thousands of intelligent, hard-working individuals facing the most intimidating barrier to college of all -- they think it just isn't possible. But the Denver Scholarship Foundation (DSF) is changing that. DSF inspires and empowers Denver Public School students to enroll in and graduate from post-secondary institutions of higher education by providing the tools knowledge, and financial resources essential for success.
