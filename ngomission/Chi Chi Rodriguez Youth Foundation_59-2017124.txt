The Chi Chi Rodriguez Youth Foundation supports the Chi Chi Rodriguez Academy. Whether kids struggle in school, socially or just want to learn golf, all are welcome at Chi Chi's and we have a program for them. The Public Partnership School serves struggling students in grades 4-8. Upon completion of the program, students will be better prepared to successfully enter high school and graduate. The Community Service program offers service learning opportunities to students who are working to fulfill their required service hours. The First Tee of Clearwater offers after school, summer and weekend programs that teach life skills and core values through golf.
