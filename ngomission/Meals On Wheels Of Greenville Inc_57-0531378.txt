Since 1968, Meals on Wheels has grown to a volunteer corps of more than 2,500 individual, group and corporate volunteers serving 1,500 meals daily throughout Greenville County. All of our clients are referred by a physician and there never has been a waiting list. Meals are provided free of charge and there is no financial qualification to receive meals. Our clients are homebound and physically or mentally challenged to a point where meal preparation is nearly impossible. Most clients live alone or with another incapacitated person. Volunteers monitor the welfare of the clients on their routes and serve as a link to other community-based services such as transportation, home health services, financial services and even home repair and handicap accessible modifications. Over the past forty-two years, Meals on Wheels has served more than nine million meals to people in need.
