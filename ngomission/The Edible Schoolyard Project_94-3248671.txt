The mission of the Edible Schoolyard Project is to build and share a food curriculum for all schools. We envision this 'edible education' as part of the core curriculum of every school in the country. If we can provide every student with a free nutritious lunch and interactive experiences in the classroom, kitchen, and garden, edible education has the power to transform the health and values of every child in America.
