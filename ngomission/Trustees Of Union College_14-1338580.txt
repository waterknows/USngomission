Founded in 1795, the first college chartered by the Board of Regents of the State of New York, Union College is an independent, liberal arts college. Its name reflects the sense of community felt by members of various groups who were instrumental in its founding. Our tradition and history provide a rock-solid foundation for innovation and inspire us to do great things. Union offers nearly 1,000 courses in the humanities, the social sciences, the sciences, and engineering - a range that is unusual among America's highly-selective colleges.
