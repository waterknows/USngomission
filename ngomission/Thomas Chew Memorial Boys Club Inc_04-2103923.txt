The Boys & Girls Club of Fall River is a youth development agency. We have been serving youth in grades kindergarten through senior year of high school in the Greater Fall River Area for over 124 years. We offer a safe place for these children to learn, play and grow. Club programs and services promote and enhance the development of our members by instilling a sense of competence, usefulness, belonging and a power of influence. Our mission is to enable youth to reach their full potential as responsible, caring and productive citizens. We believe that that every child in our community should have a safe place to learn and play, where caring adults supervise, guide and lead them to adulthood.
