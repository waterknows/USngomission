Established in 1988, Rainforest Trust partners with local, in-country conservation organizations around the world to strategically purchase and protect lands vital for wildlife conservation. We specifically target rainforests and tropical habitats that are critical for preventing species extinctions and that are exceptionally rich in biological diversity. Celebrating over 25 years of lasting conservation action, we are proud to have saved nearly 8 million acres of rainforests across 22 countries and 86 new permanent protected areas.
