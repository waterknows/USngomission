The United Way of Tri-County is a community building organization that brings people together to care for one another. We provide programs and services, connect volunteers, strengthen agencies, teach social responsibility, and meet the critical needs of the community with the help of people like you. The United Way understands that you want to make an impact in your community. Our 75 years of experience also tells us it takes a whole community working together to have lasting impact. That's why we're connected to all of our communities through business, government, faith groups, schools, agencies, and ordinary citizens. That way your donation not only goes further, it goes where it's needed most.
