Seeking to put God's love into action, Habitat for Humanity brings people together to build homes, communities and hope. Moving faith into action, Morris Habitat for Humanity advocates for and builds decent affordable housing to enhance lives and strengthen the community in partnership with volunteers and families in need. Through volunteer labor and donations of money and materials, Morris Habitat for Humanity builds and rehabilitates houses in partnership with families in need. Habitat houses are affordable because there is no profit included in the sale price and no interest is charged on the mortgage. The family's monthly mortgage payments go into a revolving fund which is used to build more houses.
