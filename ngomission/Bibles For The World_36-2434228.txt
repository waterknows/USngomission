Founded in 1971, Bibles For The World (BFTW) shares the good news of God's love in Christ Jesus by ministering to the unreached, to the Church and to Christian leaders in developing nations, with a strong emphasis on India. We do this by: strategically distributing Bibles, New Testaments, and other scripture portions; raising up godly, well educated children through our affiliated schools both in Northeast India and in Delhi; and networking and encouraging Indian churches and national Christian leaders for greater effectiveness. Equipping such leaders through the Trinity College and Seminary in Manipur, through our partnership with Serampore University in West Bengal, and through our networks with other fine evangelical seminaries throughout India.
