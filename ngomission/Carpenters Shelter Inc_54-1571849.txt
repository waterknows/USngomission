Carpenter's Shelter is Northern Virginia's award-winning homeless program, dedicated to offering housing and hope through respect, responsibility and results. In the beginning, we provided little more than bedding on cold nights in Alexandria churches. Since our doors opened in 1988, Carpenter's has helped children, families, and adults stabilize their lives, overcome homelessness, and become contributing members of their communities. We fulfill the needs of more than 700 children, families and adults each year as they work towards a better tomorrow. We operate a day shelter, the official Winter Shelter for the City of Alexandria, and an emergency shelter with comprehensive case management and education classes focused on life skills.
