The National Emergency Medicine Association (NEMA), founded in 1982, is committed to trauma prevention and the delivery of quality medical services at each stage of trauma with and emphasis on first response at the time of the emergency. Our mission is the prevention of injury and illness by addressing health and social issues through education, applied research, technology, and equipment. For more than twenty years, this work has been accomplished through our special programs including the National Heart Council, National Stroke Council, Kids Do Matter, National Alzheimer's Council, and Senior Life. We have become known for our educational health-related materials, which are free to schools, hospitals, health centers, and a wide array of social service programs.
