Founded in 1966, the Consortium for Graduate Study in Management is an alliance of the leading American business schools and some of our country's top corporations. The Consortium works to enhance diversity in business education and leadership by helping to reduce the serious underrepresentation of African Americans, Hispanic Americans and Native Americans in both our member schools' enrollments and the ranks of management. We recruit for graduate business education qualified U.S. citizens and U.S. permanent residents from these underrepresented groups, as well as other persons who can demonstrate a commitment to the Consortium's mission and can best assist the Consortium in pursuing this mission.
