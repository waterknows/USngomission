Community LINC works to end homelessness, impact poverty and remove barriers to self-sufficiency for the families we serve. We believe in a holistic approach to homelessness by providing a safe, stable place to stay and comprehensive services to equip our families to transform their lives. We teach core competencies in coaching, budgeting, and mental wellness counseling supplemented by employment services, financial education, life skills training, and exposure to health lifestyles. Since 1988 Community LINC has served 3700 families with over 11,000 individuals and 8,000 children with shelter or programming.
