SIGN Fracture Care International is a humanitarian organization that is responding to the need to provide orthopaedic treatment to trauma victims in developing countries. We focus on the poorest countries where the epidemic of road traffic and other accidents cause the most disability and loss of lives. We alleviate this burden by providing the local surgeons with the training and medical implants they need to properly treat the patients that they serve. It is through the hands and minds of the local surgeons that we can promote healing, restore health, and provide hope to the trauma victims and their families.
