Founded in 1998, the Children's Scholarship Fund (CSF) provides partial tuition assistance for low-income families to send their children to private schools. Currently, 25,700 children nationwide are using CSF scholarships. These children are attending private school through the generosity of our donors, the efforts of 30 scholarship programs, and the sacrifices made by the families themselves, who pay, on average, 50% of their children's tuition. CSF provides scholarships for children grades Kindergarten - 8th grade. The Fund focuses on elementary education because the earlier a child receives sound schooling, the better. Scholarships are awarded to all eligible children in a family to attend the school or schools of their choice.
