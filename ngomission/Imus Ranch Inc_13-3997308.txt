The Imus Ranch is an authentic working cattle ranch nestled beneath a majestic mesa in the rolling hills near Ribera, New Mexico, fifty miles northeast of Santa Fe. Founded by Don Imus and Deirdre Imus in 1998, the ranch was conceived and designed with the sole purpose of providing the experience of the great American cowboy to children suffering from cancer or serious blood disorders, and children who've lost brothers and sisters to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Our objectives are to encourage in them a sense of achievement, responsibility and self-esteem, and to instill pride and restore their dignity as they become aware of just how much they are able to accomplish. Many have become convinced that because they are sick they are not normal. At The Imus Ranch they quickly discover that they can do anything any other kid can do. Well over 1,000 kids have.
