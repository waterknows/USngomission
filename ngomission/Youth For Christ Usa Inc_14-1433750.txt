Founded in 1975, Capital District Youth for Christ reaches young people everywhere, working together with the local church and other like-minded partners to raise up lifelong followers of Jesus who lead by their godliness in lifestyle, devotion to prayer and the Word of God, passion for sharing the love of Christ and commitment to social involvement. City Life is a ministry within YFC. It is a relational, holistic, community based ministry that desires to see deep change in an urban neighborhood through the raising of indigenous leaders from the young people in that community. Our vision is to empower urban youth to change their community for Christ.
