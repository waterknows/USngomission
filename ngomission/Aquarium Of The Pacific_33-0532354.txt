The Aquarium's mission is to instill a sense of wonder, respect and stewardship for the Pacific Ocean, its inhabitants and ecosystems, by involving the community, the region, and the nation in engaging, educational, and empowering exhibits and programs. Our vision is to create the first aquarium, and perhaps the first institution, in the world dedicated to conserving and building Natural Capital (Nature and Nature's services) by building Social Capital (the interactions between and among peoples). Opened in 1998 and located on the urban waterfront in Long Beach, California, the Aquarium of the Pacific hosts approximately 1.5 million visitors each year. The 156,000 square foot campus houses over 11,000 animal inhabitants of the Pacific Ocean, which provide the foundation for all Aquarium activities and serve as ambassadors for their animal counterparts in the wild.
