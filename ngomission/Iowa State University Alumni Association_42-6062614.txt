Founded in 1878, the Iowa State University Alumni Association's long-held mission is to facilitate the lifetime connection of alumni, students, and friends with Iowa State University and each other. Our vision is to be the central organization serving and connecting all alumni and members of the Iowa State family. We host a variety of events, programs and services for alumni and friends locally and across the nation, to engage alumni in the life of the university.
