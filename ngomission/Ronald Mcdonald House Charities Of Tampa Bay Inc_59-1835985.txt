Ronald McDonald House Charities of Tampa Bay provides comfort and care to children and their families by supporting local Ronald McDonald Houses, its cornerstone program, and by making grants to other local not-for-profit organizations that help children in need. Ronald McDonald House of Tampa Bay is comprised of three Houses, two in St. Petersburg and one in Tampa, offering 66 bedrooms with private baths. Together, our Houses became a home-away-from-home and serve 2,000 pediatric families annually. The supportive environment at each of our Houses, offered through dedicated volunteers, staff and other residents, provides comfort and care to those who supply the love, understanding, nurturing and emotional support essential for their child's recovery from illness or injury.
