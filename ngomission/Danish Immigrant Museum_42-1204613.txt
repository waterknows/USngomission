The Danish Immigrant Museum was founded in 1983 to preserve the history of Danish immigration to America. In October 2013 the museum officially adopted the name Museum of Danish America. The Museum of Danish America celebrates Danish roots and American dreams. The museum's artifact collection of over 35,000 artifacts is diverse and wide ranging. There are family heirlooms brought from Denmark, remarkable examples of needlework, tools of early immigrant tradesmen and memorabilia from Danish-American clubs and organizations. Many of the items on display are treasures which have been passed down through the generations in Danish families.
