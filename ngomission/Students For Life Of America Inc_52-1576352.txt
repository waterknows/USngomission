Founded in 1988, Students for Life works to create a culture where those most affected by abortion are empowered and equipped to recruit their peers to join our human rights movement, save lives on the front lines, lead local and national initiatives, and provide tangible resources while supporting those facing an unplanned pregnancy. Since 2006, Students for Life has helped start over 550 new student pro-life organizations, trained hundreds of previously existing student pro-life groups, and trained tens of thousands of pro-lifers at its national and regional conferences and one-on-one campus trainings, and saved the lives of countless preborn children.
