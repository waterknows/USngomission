Founded in 1993, the mission of Any Baby Can is to serve families with children facing serious health or developmental challenges. Any Baby Can services are provided free of charge - regardless of income - to families who have a child birth through 12 years of age, and/or an adult individual with a chronic illness, disability, developmental delay or health risk. The child must reside in either Bexar, Atascosa, Bandera, Blanco, Caldwell, Comal, Edwards, Frio, Gillespie, Gonzales, Guadalupe, Hays, Kendall, Kerr, Kimble, Medina, Real, Uvalde or Wilson County.
