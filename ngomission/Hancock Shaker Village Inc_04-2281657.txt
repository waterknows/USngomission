Hancock Shaker Village brings the Shaker story to life and preserves it for future generations. Through this story we promote appreciation of the aesthetics, beliefs, achievements and controversies that have defined the Shaker experience in America. The Shakers are a religious order which believed in pacifism, celibacy, and communal living. Worship could take the form of singing and ecstatic dance, which is why they were called the "Shaking Quakers," or "Shakers." The utopian sect is renowned today for its plain architecture and furniture.
