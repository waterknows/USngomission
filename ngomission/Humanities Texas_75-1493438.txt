Founded in 1976, Humanities Texas advances heritage, culture, and education. As the state affiliate of the National Endowment for the Humanities, we conduct and support public programs in history, literature, philosophy, and the other humanities disciplines. These programs strengthen Texas communities by cultivating the knowledge and judgment that representative democracy demands of its citizens.
