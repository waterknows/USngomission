Jobs with Justice (JwJ) engages workers and allies in campaigns to win justice in workplaces and in communities where working families live. JwJ was founded in 1987 with the vision of lifting up workers' rights struggles as part of a larger campaign for economic and social justice. We believe in long-term multi-issue coalition building, grassroots base-building and organizing and strategic militant action as the foundation for building a grassroots movement, and we believe that by engaging a broad community of allies, we can win bigger victories. We reach working people through the organizations that represent them - unions, congregations, community organizations - and directly as JwJ activists. Nearly 100,000 people have signed the JwJ pledge to be there at least five times a year for someone else's struggle as well as their own.
