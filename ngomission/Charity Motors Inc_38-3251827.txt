Charity Motors is dedicated to helping people in need with transportation. Charity Motors provides transportation assistance to over 5,000 underprivileged individuals at a price significantly below fair market value to help foster personal development and educational advancement. Charity Motors will sell your vehicle, at a discount, to someone in need. This helps provide individuals who have struggled finding access to transportation with the freedom of their own car or truck. The proceeds from those sales benefit thousands of charities or any charity you designate at the time of donation.
