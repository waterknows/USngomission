Founded in 1837, Mount Holyoke College is a highly selective, nondenominational, residential, research liberal arts college for women enrolling approximately 2,200 students hailing from 48 states and nearly 70 countries. One of the most esteemed liberal arts colleges in the nation, Mount Holyoke is a vibrant academic community where intellectual rigor and creative thinking are prized. The College offers 49 departmental and interdisciplinary majors. As the first of the Seven Sisters - the female equivalent of the once predominantly male Ivy League - Mount Holyoke has led the way in women's education. A model upon which many other women's colleges were patterned, it quickly became synonymous with brilliant teaching and academic excellence.
