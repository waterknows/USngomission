Rally Foundation for Childhood Cancer Research was founded in 2005 in Atlanta, GA to raise awareness and funds to bridge the gap in childhood cancer research funding across the country. Rally empowers volunteers across the country to raise funds for childhood cancer research to find better treatments with fewer long-term side effect and, ultimately, cures.
