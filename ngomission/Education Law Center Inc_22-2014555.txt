Founded in 1973, the Education Law Center (ELC) serves as a voice for New Jersey's public school children and advocates for equal educational opportunity and education justice in the United States. ELC promotes educational equity through coalition building, litigation support, policy development, communications, and action-focused research in New Jersey, in other states, and at the federal level. ELC's legal and policy advocacy works to advance the provision of fair school funding, high quality early education, safe and adequate school facilities, and school reform, especially to schools serving high concentrations of at-risk students and students with disabilities and other special needs.
