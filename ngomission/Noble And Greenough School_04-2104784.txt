Noble and Greenough School, known informally as Nobles, was founded as a boys' day school in 1866. With the advent of coeducation in the mid-seventies, the student body eventually increased to its current 567. The Nobles of today is a coeducational, nonsectarian day and boarding school for students in grades seven through twelve. The School is a rigorous academic community that strives for excellence in its classroom teaching, intellectual growth in its students and commitment to the arts, athletics and service to others. Our diverse community draws together the range of experience from people of different backgrounds and promotes the principles of respect for self and for others in all its activities.
