Boys & Girls Clubs of the Austin Area works to inspire and enable all young people, especially those who need us most, to realize their full potential as productive, responsible and caring citizens. We provide kids a safe place to learn and grow; ongoing relationships with caring, adult professionals; and life-enhancing programs and character development experiences. With 18 Clubs here in Austin, we help over 12,000 kids each year (and over 1,700 each day) grow into healthy responsible, caring young adults.
