Navajo Ministries serves people, primarily the Navajo, in the Four Corners region of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and Colorado. Since 1953, we have helped to meet the physical, emotional, educational and spiritual needs of Navajo families and children. We will continue to build a future for Navajo families through programs that instill hope, restoration and Christian values. Navajo Ministries reaches Navajoland through the following programs: Four Corners Home for Children, Navajo Ministries School, Navajo Nation Outreach, and KNMI Vertical Radio, FM 88.9.
