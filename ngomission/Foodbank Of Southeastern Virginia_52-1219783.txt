The Foodbank of Southeastern Virginia (FSEVA), a member of Feeding America and the Federation of Virginia Food Banks, has served hungry people in since 1981. The Foodbank is a warehouse or "bank" where recovered and contributed food is collected, sorted and distributed to over 500 agencies including church pantries and area Kids Cafes who then prepares and serve the food to those in need. FSEVA has established 25 Kids Cafes, wonderful after-school feeding programs for disadvantaged latchkey children. FSEVA also provides low-income seniors with highly nutritious food items, particularly towards the end of the month when most food budgets are low or depleted.
