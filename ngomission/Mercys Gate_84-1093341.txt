Mercy's Gate began 30 years ago as a food pantry called Northern Churches Care. Our mission was to join together to love our neighbors in Colorado Springs by helping with their physical, financial, emotional, and spiritual needs. Over the years, we've seen the city's boundaries change and the needs of our community grow. As a result of the increased need, we've grown, expanded our services and programs, and have spread out into three different locations. Every week, through our member churches and faithful volunteers and staff, we provide much-needed food, clothing, help with utilities and rent, medical assistance . . . and most importantly, spiritual care and emotional support. The need is great.
