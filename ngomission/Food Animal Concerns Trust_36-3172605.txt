Food Animal Concerns Trust (FACT) is a Chicago based non-profit organization that promotes humane and healthy farms through science-based advocacy, consumer education, and support for humane farmers. Since 1982 we have been involved in efforts to increase awareness about the conditions experienced by chickens, pigs and cows. FACT seeks to improve the welfare of food producing animals, broaden opportunities for humane farmers, and address the public health problems that come from the production of meat, milk, and eggs.
