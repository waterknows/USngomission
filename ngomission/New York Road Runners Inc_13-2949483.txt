Founded in 1958, NYRR has grown from a local running club to the world's premier community running organization, whose mission is to help and inspire people through running. NYRR's commitment to New York City's five boroughs features races, community events, youth initiatives, school programs, and training resources that provide hundreds of thousands of people each year, from children to seniors, with the motivation, know-how, and opportunity to run for life. We are committed to the runners of tomorrow, passionately providing youth programs that educate and motivate more than 200,000 kids in communities in New York City, across the United States, and around the world. NYRR's premier event, the TCS New York City Marathon, features 50,000 participants, from the world's elite athletes to a wide range of recreational and charity runners, and is part of the World Marathon Majors, an alliance of the world's six biggest marathons that determines each year's top male and top female marathoner.
