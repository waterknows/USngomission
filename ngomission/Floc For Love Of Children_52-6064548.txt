For Love of Children (FLOC) has worked to protect and inspire thousands of Washington, DC's most vulnerable children and youth, and to strengthen their families, since its founding in 1965. Today, FLOC's mission is to offer educational services that equip high-risk children and youth with the skills necessary to break the cycle of poverty, become life-long learners, and make substantial contributions to their communities. Through example and partnership, For Love of Children will use education to empower young people and their families to close society's achievement gap. For the past 40 years, FLOC has helped more than 10,000 children discover and build on their dreams for a bright future.
