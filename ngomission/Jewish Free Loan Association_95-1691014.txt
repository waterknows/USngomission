The Jewish Free Loan Association of Los Angeles ("JFLA") offers interest-free loans on a non-sectarian basis to individuals and families whose needs are urgent and who may not qualify through normal financial resources. Interest-free loans instead of charity fill an important gap in our social system by promoting self-sufficiency with dignity. JFLA affirms the ancient biblical requirement for interest-free lending by offering assistance to people in need with the goal of helping them to lead more rewarding and responsible lives.Today, JFLA grants more than 1,200 interest-free loans per year for emergencies, education, healthcare, developing small businesses, environmental upgrades and life cycle events. JFLA maintains a 99% repayment rate and as loans are repaid new loans are made, perpetuating a cycle of hope.
