The Boston Arts Academy Foundation is dedicated to raising funds in support of Boston Arts Academy, Boston's only public high school for the visual and performing arts. Founded in 1998, Boston Arts Academy (BAA) provides Boston's low-income students with access to a quality arts and academic education not otherwise available to them. The school's mission is to prepare a diverse community of aspiring artist-scholars to be successful in their college or professional careers and to be engaged members of a democratic society. Our academic-blind admissions process ensures that students of all levels of academic ability have the opportunity to pursue their passion for the arts. Over 70% of the school's 440 students are from low-income households. Through the arts, coupled with a full-college preparatory education, an average of 94% of BAA graduates are accepted to college -- many being the first in their families to reach this milestone.
