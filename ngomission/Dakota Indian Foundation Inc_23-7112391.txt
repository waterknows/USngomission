Dakota Indian Foundation was founded in 1971 because of the concern for the plight of the Dakota Sioux Indian and to find some means to assist them and preserve their history and culture. The Foundation grants funds to groups and organizations throughout the former Great Sioux Nation to support a wide variety of activities directly related to the social enhancement and cultural preservation of the Dakota Sioux Indian People, such as: the publication of texts which preserve and teach the language and culture; preschool tuition and post-High School scholarships; distribution of clothing, bedding and books on the reservations; and a facility to house, preserve and display examples of the Indian culture.
