REDF (also known as The Roberts Enterprise Development Fund) is a San Francisco-based venture philanthropy organization that creates jobs and employment opportunities for people facing the greatest barriers to work. Founded in 1997 REDF provides equity-like grants and business assistance to a portfolio of nonprofits in California to start and expand social enterprisesâ€”nonprofit-operated businesses selling goods and services demanded by the marketplace while intentionally employing young people and adults who would otherwise face bleak prospects of ever getting a job.
