The Shea Center for Therapeutic Riding is dedicated to improving the lives of people with disabilities through therapeutic horse-related programs. The Shea Center operates under the rules and regulations of The North American Riding for the Handicapped Association. A variety of therapeutic riding classes are usually operating at the same time over various parts of the property. A NARHA certified instructor, assigned to each class, will lead that class through riding exercises specifically designed to address and improve client disabilities. Group classes are small, usually 4 - 6 riders, and last about one hour.
