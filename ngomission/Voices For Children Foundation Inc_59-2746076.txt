Founded in 1984, Voices For Children Foundation raises funds to support the 11th Judicial Circuit Guardian Ad Litem (GAL) Program. Additionally, Voices raises funds to meet the social, educational, and medical needs of Miami-Dade's abused, abandoned, and neglected children. Voices For Children exists to fill a big gap. The State of Florida requires that the interests of every abused, abandoned, and neglected child be represented by a GAL. However, the GAL Program does not receive adequate public funding. That's where Voices helps.
