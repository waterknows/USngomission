Habitat for Humanity of Kent County strengthens families and communities in service to God through partnerships, healthy house building, and affordable homeownership. Habitat homes are not given; they are purchased by homeowners through 25 year, zero-interest mortgages. Habitat partners work side by side with other future homeowners, and community volunteers to build homes. Habitat partners must be willing to contribute 300-500 hours of sweat equity and attend the required homebuyer educational classes, workshops. Habitat for Humanity of Kent County has built more than 260 homes since its founding in 1983 and has had only three foreclosures.
