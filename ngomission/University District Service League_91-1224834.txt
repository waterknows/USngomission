For 32 years, University District Food Bank has helped prevent hunger in Northeast Seattle neighborhoods. Each week, families receive the groceries they need to prepare nutritionally balanced meals at home. We are consistently one of the busiest food banks in the City of Seattle. Our home delivery program reaches homebound seniors and our backpack program provides kids with healthy meals and snacks for the weekend when school meals aren't available.
