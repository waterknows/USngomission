The Erie City Mission is a Christian social outreach program created in 1911 by the famous evangelist Bill Sunday. Located in Erie, Pennsylvania the Mission encompasses two buildings at 1017 and 1023 French Street. The Mission has many programs to serve the local community and continues to expand its care programs. The 1017 Building contains Hope Center Addiction Treatment Services. It is a fully licensed in-patient drug and alcohol program for men and out-patient program for women and men. Hope Center also treats gambling addiction. In the 1023 building we house the Men's New Life Program and serve the general public a meal at noon each day.
