Founded in 1996 by three of New York's most acclaimed downtown theater artists -director Jim Simpson, designer Kyle Chepulis and playwright Mac Wellman - the award-winning Flea Theater was originally formed out of the purely artistic impulse to create "a joyful hell in a small space." Brash, energetic and dedicated, we quickly became a downtown beacon for creative artists of every discipline, and for audiences seeking bold and inventive work. Soon a more formal mission was born: to present distinctive work that raises the standards of Off-Off-Broadway for artists & audiences alike. Comfortable seats and decent dressing rooms became as much a part of our goal as our commitment to supporting talented artists with big ideas.
