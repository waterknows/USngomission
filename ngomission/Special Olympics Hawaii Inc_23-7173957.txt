Special Olympics unleashes the human spirit through the transformative power and joy of sports everyday in Hawai'i. Through work in sports, health education and community building, Special Olympics is addressing inactivity, injustice, intolerance and social isolation by encouraging and empowering people with intellectual disabilities which leads to a more welcoming and inclusive society. Founded in 1968 by Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the Hawai'i Special Olympics movement has grown from a handful of athletes to more than 3,900 athletes across the state. With the support of more than 8,500 coaches and volunteers, Special Olympics is able to deliver nine Olympic-type sports and more than 40 competitions throughout the year. There is never a fee for any athlete or family to participate in Special Olympics programs.
