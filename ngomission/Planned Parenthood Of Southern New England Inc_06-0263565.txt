Planned Parenthood of Southern New England (PPSNE) was formed in 2009 with the merger of Planned Parenthood of Connecticut and Planned Parenthood of Rhode Island. PPSNE provides birth control, pregnancy testing, STD testing and treatment, and other essential services to nearly 70,000 patients each year. The mission of Planned Parenthood of Southern New England is to protect the fundamental right of all individuals to manage their own fertility and sexual health, and to ensure access to the services, education and information to realize that right.
