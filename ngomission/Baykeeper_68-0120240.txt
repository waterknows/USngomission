San Francisco Baykeeper's mission is to safeguard San Francisco Bay from pollution. Baykeeper was established in 1989 to defend the water quality of San Francisco Bay and to protect the Bay ecosystem, wildlife and local communities. Baykeeper's small, highly skilled staff uses on-the-water patrols, water quality monitoring, science, education, advocacy and legal action to strengthen clean water laws and keep pollution out of the Bay. With the help of our members, Baykeeper works to ensure a healthy San Francisco Bay for all.
