Founded in 1958, the Boys & Girls Clubs of the Peninsula guides and inspires the youth of our community to develop the attitudes and life skills they need to thrive. The Boys & Girls Clubs of the Peninsula provides places where young people aged 6-18 are welcome and can belong after school and all day during the summer. At each of the Club's now nine sites located in the most challenged areas of Menlo Park, East Palo Alto and Redwood City, California, trained and caring staff and a cadre of volunteers work through a broad range of programs. Over 1,100 youth attend the Club daily.
