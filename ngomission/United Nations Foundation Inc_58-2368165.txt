The United Nations Foundation (UN Foundation) was created in 1998 with entrepreneur and philanthropist Ted Turner's historic $1 billion gift to support UN causes and activities. We are an advocate for the UN and a platform for connecting people, ideas and resources to help the United Nations solve global problems. We help the UN take its best work and ideas to scale - through advocacy, partnerships, constituency building and fund raising. The UN Foundation, through our sister organization, the Better World Campaign, advocates in support of a strong, effective and fully funded United Nations. A strong UN is the world's most effective voice for international cooperation on behalf of peace, development, human rights and the environment.
