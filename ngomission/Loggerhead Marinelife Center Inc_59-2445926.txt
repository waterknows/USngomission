Loggerhead Marinelife Center's (LMC) works to promote conservation of Florida's costal ecosystems with a special focus on threatened and endangered sea turtles. LMC is dedicated to ocean conservation efforts specifically through education and research efforts of LMC staff and volunteers. We can not do this alone - we need your help to speak on behalf of the endangered sea turtles and other marine life found in our coastal waters.
