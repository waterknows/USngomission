Founded in 1909, United Way of Greater Milwaukee is committed to improving lives in our community. We provide for people's basic needs, we strengthen families, children and youth, and help individuals become self-sufficient. We also focus on the root causes of our community's most critical problems to break the cycle of poverty - the key to lasting change. United Way supports a safety net of services that provides people with the support and tools they need to build a better life while also focusing on the underlying causes of problems by investing in programs that address: early education, healthy girls, job training and retention, and asset building.
