Nebraska AIDS Project leads the community in the fight to overcome HIV/AIDS and its stigma through education, supportive services and advocacy. Nebraska AIDS Project was organized in 1984 when medical professionals, Catholic nuns, Health Department officials, concerned citizens, friends, family members and lovers joined together for one cause - fighting AIDS. Organized to provide compassionate support to those dying with AIDS and to provide education to prevent the further spread of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, Nebraska AIDS Project remains true to that mission: prevention and support.
