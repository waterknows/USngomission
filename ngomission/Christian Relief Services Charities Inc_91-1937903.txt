Incorporated in 1985, Christian Relief Services was founded on the belief that community partnerships are the best way to solve problems related to poverty, both here in the United States and around the world. The mission of Christian Relief Services is to work through partnerships and in collaboration with grassroots charitable organizations to connect the vast resources of the United States with communities in need to enable the people of these communities to help themselves. Through partnerships with local, non-governmental organizations and our affiliates, we provide donations of food, medical supplies, hygiene items, school supplies and building materials to hospitals, clinics, schools, orphanages and refugee camps in several African countries.
