Habitat for Humanity of Spartanburg is an ecumenical Christian ministry that builds simple, decent, affordable houses in partnership with Spartanburg families. Habitat invites people of all backgrounds, races and religions to join us in building houses together in partnership with families in need. Our partner families are first-time owners and contribute 250 hours of 'sweat equity' and pay a low-interest mortgage. Habitat for Humanity of Spartanburg has 115 homes in Spartanburg since our founding in 1987. We are projected to build seven homes in the 2015-16 fiscal year.
