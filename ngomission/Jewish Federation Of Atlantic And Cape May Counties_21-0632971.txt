The Jewish Federation of Atlantic and Cape May Counties is the umbrella organization for the organized Jewish Communities. The Federation cares for those in need, rescues those in harm's way and renews and strengthens the Jewish people in our area, in Israel and in 33 nations around the world. By participating in the Federation's programs and policies, individuals can contribute to two pillars of the Jewish faith: Tikkun Olam, the healing of the world and Tzedakah, righteousness.
