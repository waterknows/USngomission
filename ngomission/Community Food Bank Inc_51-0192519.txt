Through education, advocacy and the acquisition, storage and distribution of food, we will anticipate and meet the food needs of the hungry in our community. The Community Food Bank distributes enough food for over 61,000 meals every day. Every month 225,000 people in Southern Arizona receive assistance through our programs.
