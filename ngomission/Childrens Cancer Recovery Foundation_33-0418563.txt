Children's Cancer Recovery Foundation annually assists more than 16,000 children, and their families, who are facing the hardships of a cancer diagnosis. Its mission is to deliver simple acts of care and kindness to children and their families experiencing cancer. It focuses on improving the mental, social and emotional well-being of children with cancer by minimizing the devastation that cancer can cause. Its programs deliver toys to children in hospitals, provide financial assistance to families, send children to recreational camps, and promote toxic free lifestyles to reduce childhood cancer incidence and mortality.
