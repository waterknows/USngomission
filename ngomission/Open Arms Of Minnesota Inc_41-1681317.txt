Open Arms is the only nonprofit organization in Minnesota that cooks and delivers free meals specifically tailored to meet the nutrition needs of individuals living with cancer, HIV/AIDS, MS, and ALS. We also work with communities in sub-Saharan Africa, providing food and technical assistance for people living with and affected by HIV/AIDS. Open Arms meals are tasty, convenient and healthy. Our professional chefs focus on using fresh ingredients in our meals instead of heavily processed food, so you can rest assured that you are getting great nutrition. We even have an urban farm that produces beautiful veggies for our kitchen during the summer and fall.
