Founded in 1992, the mission of the Childhood Leukemia Foundation (CLF) is to lift the spirit and enhance the quality of life of children suffering with cancer. Our goal is to make sure children battling cancer know they are not alone. All of our programs have been designed to: educate and entertain; provide a sense of physical normalcy and help raise self esteem; encourage physical participation and therapeutic play; maintain a communications lifeline; and provide care management tools. CLF works with more than 140 specialized treatment centers. The organization serves over 15,000 children nationwide with free program and service offerings for childhood cancer patients and their families.5
