Since our founding in 1874, the East Bay SPCA has been a national leader in and advocate for animal welfare. Our shelter, adoption services and advocacy date back 140 years and our low-cost veterinary clinic established in 1927, was one of the first in the nation and still stands alone in our region. The East Bay SPCA is committed to the welfare of cats and dogs in the communities we serve. We strive to eliminate animal cruelty, neglect and overpopulation by providing programs and education that support people and companion animals.We believe in keeping people and their pets together and provide affordable veterinary and spay/neuter services, and educate owners and the general public on responsible pet ownership with behavior and training classes and outreach to children and adults teaching humane values. We have two Adoption and Education Centers and three clinics in the community, serving Alameda and Contra Costa counties.
