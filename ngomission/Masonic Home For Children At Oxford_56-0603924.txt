The Masonic Home for Children at Oxford assists families in need by providing a safe, home-like setting for children until they are reunited with family or achieve independence. Children in our residential care program live in a family setting and receive quality care in a caring and stable environment. Our Independent Living Program serves young adults ages 18 to 21, as they leave foster care or achieve independence. Our Home survives and our children are cared for through the charity of others. The Masonic Home for Children continues to grow, adapt, and change to meet the needs of children today and preparing them for a better tomorrow.
