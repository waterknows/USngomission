Founded in 1950, Junior Achievement of Northern New England works to inspire and prepare young people to succeed in a global economy. Using hands-on experiences, JA helps to prepare young people for the real world by teaching skills in financial literacy, workforce readiness and entrepreneurship. Junior Achievement trains community volunteers to deliver curricula, and to incorporate the sharing of personal and professional experiences with students. The hallmark of Junior Achievement efforts, these mentors inspire students by transforming the JA lessons into relevant messages that connect what is learned in the classroom to real-world situations.
