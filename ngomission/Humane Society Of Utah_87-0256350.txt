The Humane Society of Utah (HSU) is dedicated to the elimination of pain, fear and suffering in all animals. The HSU is the largest and most effective shelter in Utah. As of 2015, the HSU gained "no-kill" status as well. The HSU provides the following programs to save the lives of animals: shelter, care and adoption of homeless pets; low-cost sterilization surgeries and vaccinations at our own state-of-the-art in-house clinic; full-time cruelty investigator; foster care program to ensure the adoptability of pets; outreach adoptions to bring adoptable animals to off-site locations; behavior and training; and transfer and rescue to intake at-risk pets from other overcrowded shelters. We also educate the public about humane care of animals and adoption through presentations with school-aged children, publications, and social media.
