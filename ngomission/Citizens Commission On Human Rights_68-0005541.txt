The Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR) is a non-profit, non-political, non-religious mental health watchdog, responsible for helping to enact more than 150 laws protecting individuals from abusive or coercive practices. CCHR functions solely as a mental health watchdog, working alongside many medical professionals including doctors, scientists, nurses and those few psychiatrists who have taken a stance against the biological/drug model of "disease" that is continually promoted by the psychiatric/pharmaceutical industry as a way to sell drugs. It is a non political, non-religious, non-profit organization dedicated solely to eradicating mental health abuse and enacting patient and consumer protections. CCHR's Board of Advisers, called Commissioners, include doctors, scientists, psychologists, lawyers, legislators, educators, business professionals, artists and civil and human rights representatives.
