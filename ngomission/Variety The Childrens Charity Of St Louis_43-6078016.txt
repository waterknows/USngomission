Founded in 1932, the mission of Variety the Children's Charity of St. Louis is to serve children with physical and mental disabilities in the Greater St. Louis region whose needs would not be met were it not for Variety's sustained commitment. Variety serves these children each time they need assistance, from infancy to the age of 21, focusing on four core areas to help kids become independent and productive: gifting medical equipment for mobility and independence; developing unique education and recreational programs; and funding therapy. Variety partners with 75 agencies to support programs and give scholarships that directly impact the lives of Variety children.
