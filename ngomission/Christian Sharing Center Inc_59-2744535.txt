The Christian Sharing Center works to prevent hunger and homelessness by assisting with basic and essential needs during times of personal financial crises caused by job loss and medical issues. Clients may receive food and clothing, help with costs of rent/mortgage, transportation, bus tokens, costs of prescriptions and other medical issues, utilities, household goods. Children or adults in the family may be assisted in special ways specific to their individual or family needs. Our Oasis daytime service center allows homeless people to get showers, clean clothes, haircuts, access to computers for job searches and links to other services to help them find jobs or housing and regain stability.
