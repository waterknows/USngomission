Haiti Outreach, Inc. is a non-governmental organization (NGO) based in Minnesota in the U.S. and Pignon, Haiti, that works with communities in Haiti on water, education and other projects that the communities initiate, help build and sustain. We operate using a 4-point community development model for long term sustainability to ensure that the projects will last over a long period of time. In order for this to happen, a maintenance program based on an economic system - a community savings account to which all users contribute and from which future repairs can be paid - is created and used. Our work is based on a grassroots effort involving community responsibility, participation and ownership, unlike many well-intentioned development projects that lack this economic sustainability element and end up creating a dependency.
