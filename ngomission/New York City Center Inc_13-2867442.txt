Opened in 1943, New York City Center's (NYCC) mission is to make the finest in the performing arts accessible to the broadest possible audience, while insuring that its landmark facility remains an active and welcoming venue to both audiences and artists throughout the year. NYCC accomplishes this mission by celebrating and preserving the American musical theater heritage through performances, score restorations and other archival activities; presenting and producing new and innovative programming resonant of NYCC's artistic history, with a specific emphasis on dance; supporting resident and visiting companies and artists; providing educational opportunities to NYC students and their teachers; and maintaining and enhancing the physical facilities that comprise the performing arts center.
