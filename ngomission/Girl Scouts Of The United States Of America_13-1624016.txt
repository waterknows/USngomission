Founded in 1912, Girl Scouts of the USA is the world's preeminent organization dedicated solely to girls where, in an accepting and nurturing environment, girls build character and skills for success in the real world. In partnership with committed adult volunteers, girls develop qualities that will serve them all their lives, like leadership, strong values, social conscience, and conviction about their own potential and self-worth. Today there are 3.3 million Girl Scouts - 2.4 million girl members and 928,000 adult members. Girls at home and abroad participate in more than 236,000 troops and groups in more than 90 countries through USA Girl Scouts Overseas, and over 300 local Girl Scout councils offer girls the opportunity for membership across the United States.
