Founded in 1998, Washington Area Women's Foundation transforms the lives of women and girls, the Washington region and the world. The Foundation connects the DC area with the global movement that recognizes that promoting women's and girl's prosperity is key to stronger, more resilient and healthier communities. We believe in the promise and value of every women and girl in the Washington area because we know that when they achieve their full potential, our entire region benefits. In 2011, The Women's Foundation responded to the continuing national economic crisis and increase in local poverty by sharpening its focus on the economic security of women and girls. The Foundation wanted to ensure that our community's collective resources are focused on the intersection of where there is the most need and where we can have the most impact.
