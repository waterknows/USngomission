California Community Foundation is the charitable fund serving all of Los Angeles County.  We do this by helping individuals, families and organizations meet their own philanthropic goals and by supporting Los Angeles nonprofits through our grantmaking, program-related investments and endowment building services. We seek to improve life for all residents, especially those who are most vulnerable; promote philanthropy and act as an effective steward of charitable funds; and work with others to address the core causes of problems facing our region.
