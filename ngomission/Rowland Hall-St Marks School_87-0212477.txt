Rowland Hall-St. Mark's School (RHSM) inspires students to lead ethical and productive lives through a college preparatory program that promotes the pursuit of academic and personal excellence. RHSM was formed in 1964 through the merging of St. Mark's, a boys' day school, with Rowland Hall, a boarding school for young women. Today two urban campuses serve 1,000 students from preschool (age 2) through grade 12. The student-teacher ratio is 10:1; average class size is 14 students. RHSM offers a full liberal arts curriculum plus art, music, drama, dance, service learning, technology, physical education, and interfaith chapel. Nearly 20 percent of the student body represents diverse ethnic, national and racial backgrounds.
