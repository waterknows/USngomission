Council for Children's Rights is a legal advocacy program for children in the Southeast which stands up for every child's right to be safe, healthy, and educated. In 2006, the Council for Children and the Children's Law Center united to create Council for Children's Rights. As the state's leading expert on children's issues, we provide holistic representation for children in Mecklenburg County to ensure their long-term success and well-being. Our team of 30, highly-skilled advocates, attorneys and social workers provide legal representation, advocacy, systems reform, public policy, and research and planning for the most at-risk populations in the community.
