Founded in 1971, The Hasten Hebrew Academy of Indianapolis has a long history of providing a high quality education to students in early childhood through eighth grade. Our mission is to create a learning environment that fosters the religious, social and academic growth of all students. Because the progress of each student is valued highly, great efforts are made to assure stable learning goals for everyone. All students are encouraged to work toward producing a maximum potential. In pursuit of academic excellence, we emphasize basic skills, higher-order thinking and life long learning. Together as a community of learners, we promote growth in knowledge and identification with Jewish traditions. By nurturing a love of learning, we seek to develop responsible, ethical and caring Jewish adults and American citizens of the future.
