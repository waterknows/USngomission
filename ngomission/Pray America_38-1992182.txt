Pray America is a Jesus-centered ministry committed to loving the hurting and marginalized people in the Chichicastenango area of Guatemala. Our desire is to see these long-oppressed people realize spiritual, physical, emotional and relational freedom. The foundations of the ministry are a commitment to intercessory prayer, living in community with the people we serve and sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ through both words and works.
