The Student Conservation Association is the only national organization that builds new generations of conservation leaders and inspires lifelong stewardship of our environment and communities by providing high school and college students with service opportunities in all 50 states, from urban communities to national parks and forests. More than 4,000 SCA members annually render over two million hours of conservation service, an experience that transforms both the land and the individual. Founded in 1957, SCA is headquartered in Washington D.C., and operates the SCA National Conservation Center in Charlestown, NH as well as regional offices in Anchorage, AK, Boise, ID, Oakland, CA, Pittsburgh, PA, and Seattle, WA.
