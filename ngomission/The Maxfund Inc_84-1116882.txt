The MaxFund Animal Adoption Center was established in 1988 to provide medical care for injured pets with no known owners, and to seek out new homes for these animals once they have recovered. The MaxFund provides emergency care and a home for injured animals until the owner is located or a suitable home is found. This service is provided, without cost, to the caring person who notifies the MaxFund. The MaxFund is a true no-kill shelter. We also provide low-cost vaccinations, pet food, and spay/neuter clinics for pets of low income families; no-fee adoptions for senior citizens and AIDS patients; and a therapy program which takes pets to visit senior centers, the VA Hospital and nursing homes.
