Established in 1928, Crane Country Day School has remained true to the vision of its founders, offering rigorous academic programs with hands-on experiences that challenge both the intellect and the imagination. At Crane, we teach the whole child. We provide children with opportunities in academics, arts, sports, and community service. Involvement in these activities helps each child discover talents and strengths, which build every child's joy and confidence. Part of Crane's philosophy is a focus on hard work and personal responsibility. Crane's rigorous academic standards in combination with effective, individualized teaching methods allow us to challenge our students to move to the next level. We seek to inspire students to develop a deeper understanding of subject matter both in and beyond the classroom.
