Presbyterian Frontier Fellowship's (PFF) mission is to mobilize congregations to participate with God in bringing good news of the kingdom into cultures where the church has yet to take root. We seek to stimulate congregational involvement in mission among people groups where there is no indigenous church. In 2010, over 800 churches met with staff of PFF. Many churches are catching a vision for frontier mission and we are excited to see that vision grow and expand each day.
