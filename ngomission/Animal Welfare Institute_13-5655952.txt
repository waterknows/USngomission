Horses brutally butchered for sale abroad. Dogs and cats stolen for experimentation. Wildlife caught in brutal traps. Farm animals confined in coffin-like crates. Majestic whales slaughtered at sea. The Animal Welfare Institute (AWI) works around the world and on Capitol Hill to address these issues and other forms of animal suffering. Founded in 1951, our mission is to eliminate pain and fear inflicted on animals by humans. In 2006, we launched our Animal Welfare Approved program which sets high welfare standards for animals raised for food; by labeling products from compliant family farms, this program provides consumers with humanely produced eggs, meat and dairy products.
