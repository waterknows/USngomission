United Way of Collier County advances the common good for all who live and work in Collier County, Florida. To fulfill our mission, we conduct organized, coordinated fundraising campaigns and events that are generously supported by both the business community and private individuals. We partner with over 30 human service agencies and provide funding to hundreds of local programs and services that help over 100,000 adults and children annually in our community. Beginning October 1, 2013, we assumed the responsibility for the oversight and operation of the non-emergency "211" hotline serving Collier County. The "211" hotline provides information and referrals  for both those seeking basic human service needs and those in crisis. To give, advocate, or volunteer, please call 239-261-7112 or visit www.uwcollier.org.
