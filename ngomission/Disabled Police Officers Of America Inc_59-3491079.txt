The Disabled Police Officers of America (DPOA), formerly known as the Disabled and Retired Police Officers Educational Fund (DRPOEF), was established in 1998. The DPOA mission is to provide financial assistance to disabled and regularly retired officers to pursue the academic degree or vocational training required to obtain civilian employment following their retirement from law enforcement. In addition the DPOA provides financial assistance for a variety of uses to help retired and disabled officers though a short-term financial crisis. Requests for assistance have ranged from help paying for medications, utility bills, rent, and emergency repairs.
