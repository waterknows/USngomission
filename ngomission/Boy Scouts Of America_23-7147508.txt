The mission of the Boy Scouts of America, Quivira Council is to prepare young people to make ethical and moral choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the scout oath and law scout oath. Quivira council, Boy Scouts of America was incorporated on January 22, 1924. Since then it has been our honor to instill in the youth we serve the values and traditions that make Boy Scouts of America stand apart in the crowd. Thirty counties throughout central and south central Kansas are served by the Quivira Council.
