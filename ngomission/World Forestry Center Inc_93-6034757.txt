Founded in 1964 in Portland, Oregon, the World Forestry Center works to educate and inform people about the world's forests and trees, and their importance to all life, in order to promote a balanced and sustainable future. We do this with three programs: Discovery Museum, tree farms, and the World Forest Institute. Our 20,000 square foot Discovery Museum is located in Portland's beautiful Washington Park. All new hands-on, interactive exhibits are family friendly and designed to engage visitors to learn about the sustainability of forests and trees of the Pacific Northwest and around the world. The World Forest Institute was established in 1989 as the information services division of the World Forestry Center.
