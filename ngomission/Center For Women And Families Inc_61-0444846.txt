The Center for Women and Families helps victims of intimate partner abuse or sexual violence to become survivors through supportive services, community education and cooperative partnerships that foster hope, promote self-sufficiency and rebuild lives. Originally part of the YWCA, The Center for Women and Families has been serving our community since 1912. Today The Center is a private organization with 6 regional locations serving 10 Kentuckiana counties: Bullitt, Henry, Jefferson, Oldham, Shelby, Spencer and Trimble counties in Kentucky and Clark, Floyd and Harrison counties in Indiana.
