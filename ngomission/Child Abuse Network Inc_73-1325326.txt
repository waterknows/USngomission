The Child Abuse Network is Tulsa's Children's Advocacy Center (CAN). CAN serves as the coordinator for the multiple agencies that interact with children of reported child abuse. The result is a collaborative and non-duplicated interagency approach to investigate abuse and protect children in crisis. CAN's mission is to provide collaborative intervention services to child abuse victims, so that they are encouraged to embrace a future driven by hope.
