The Federal Employee Education & Assistance Fund (FEEA) is the only non-profit organization devoted solely to helping civilian federal and postal employees. FEEA helps federal employees every day through our three signature programs, including an annual scholarship competition, emergency assistance program, and child care subsidy program. FEEA sponsors the only annual, merit-based contest open only to civilian federal and postal employees, their spouses and college-age children. Emergency loans are available to help employees who fall behind on basic living expenses (mortgage/rent or utilities) due to unforeseen emergencies such as leave without pay, government pay error, death or illness in the family. FEEA administers a childcare subsidy program for more than two dozen federal agencies.
