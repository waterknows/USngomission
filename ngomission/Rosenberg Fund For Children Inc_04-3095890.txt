The Rosenberg Fund for Children (RFC) was established to provide for the educational and emotional needs of children whose parents have suffered because of their progressive activities and who, therefore, are no longer able to provide fully for their children. The RFC also provides grants for the educational and emotional needs of targeted activist youth. The RFC defines targeted as someone who as a result of his or her activism, has: lost a job; suffered physical or mental injury or disability; been harassed or discriminated against; been imprisoned; or died. The RFC was founded in 1990 by Robert Meeropol, who was orphaned at age six when his parents, Ethel & Julius Rosenberg, were executed at the height of the McCarthy Era.
