Manna Food Center strives to eliminate hunger in Montgomery County through food distribution, nutrition education, and advocacy. What we do is simple and essential. Manna Food Center fights hunger by collecting and distributing 4 million lbs of food each year to needy individuals and families. Manna provides a 3-5 day supply of balanced food at a dozen distribution points in the County.  We also share healthy Smart Sacks with the families of 2,400 elementary school children every Friday of the school year. We help our neighbors learn to shop on a budget with our grocery store tours, and regularly provide recipes and cooking demonstrations. We are at the center of local efforts to provide a safety net to the most vulnerable & build prosperity for the working poor struggling to make ends meet. Through Community Food Rescue we build the capacity of other agencies to feed more and waste less. 94 cents of every dollar donated goes to program expenses. Thank you for your support.
