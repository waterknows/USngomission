Energy Outreach Colorado is dedicated to keeping Colorado homes warm, healthy and safe by raising money for energy assistance. We assist people in emergency situations by helping pay the balances on their utility bills. We also help limited income families to be more self-sufficient by funding energy efficiency measures that lower energy costs in affordable housing across Colorado. Through the Charitable Energy Network and the Low-Income Energy Assistance Program (LEAP), we help those in need across Colorado. We also support Energy Efficiency Programs that provide long-term solutions to help needy Coloradoans control their energy use and lower their bills.
