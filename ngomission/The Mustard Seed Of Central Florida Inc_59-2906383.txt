The mission of the Mustard Seed of Central Florida is to provide household goods, furniture, clothing, toys and books to those who have suffered from natural or personal disaster and who demonstrate the desire to rebuild their lives and become self-sufficient. The Mustard Seed helps an average of over 100 traumatized families a month regain their dignity and independence. The Mustard Seed Furniture and Clothing Bank provides the basic life necessities to help our Mustard Seed families regain their dignity and self-worth. We are helping rebuild the disrupted, often shattered, lives of the homeless and others who have lost everything, due to unforeseen circumstances.
