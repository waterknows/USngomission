The Coalition On Temporary Shelter (COTS) was founded in 1981 to address Detroit's growing crisis of homelessness. Today, COTS manages three 24-hour facilities. Annually we serve approximately 2,000 Detroit area homeless people in our Emergency Shelter and approximately 260 individuals and families in our transitional and permanent housing programs. Through case management and a wide array of supportive services and housing programs, COTS helps homeless individuals and families break the cycle of homelessness by addressing the causes of their homelessness.
