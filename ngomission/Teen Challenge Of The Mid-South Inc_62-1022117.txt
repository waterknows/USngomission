In 1978, Teen Challenge of the Mid-South was birthed in Chattanooga and has been involved in meeting the needs of those bound by life-controlling addictions. Our organization has grown from its humble beginnings in a small home on Willow Street serving only six men, to its present location of seven acres at the foot of Lookout Mountain. We now have the ability to serve over 100 men and women. This is a 12-month residential program for both men and women. The goal of Teen Challenge of the Mid-South is to evangelize people who have drug, alcohol, and other life-controlling problems and initiate the discipleship process to the point where they can function as Christians in society by applying spiritually-motivated biblical principles to relationships in the family, local church, their chosen vocation, and the community.
