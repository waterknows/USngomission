The Community Soup Kitchen and Outreach Center provides nutritious meals in a warm, safe and caring environment, free of charge, no questions asked, to anyone who comes seeking nourishment. As part of our hospitality we also encourage and assist our guests in accessing community resources, services and educational programs. Our Free Farmers Markets provide fresh fruit, vegetables and meat for guests to take home three days a week. In response to the need in the community, this year we also began opening our doors at 9:00 a.m. and offering breakfast. Over the last 12 months, the Community Soup Kitchen served more than 58,000 breakfast and lunch meals, distributed over 425,000 pounds of food, and provided more than 2,600 referrals to social and medical services to help our guests get back on their feet. The Community Soup Kitchen receives no government funding and has never missed a day in more than 30 years.
