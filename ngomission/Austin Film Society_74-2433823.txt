The Austin Film Society is a non-profit organization that empowers our community to make, watch and love film and creative media by: showing great films and premieres, managing a 100,000 square foot film production facility in central Austin, awarding grants and supporting filmmakers, teaching kids & adults about filmmaking and presenting the annual Texas Film Awards to raise funds for all the above. The Austin Film Society began in 1985 with a group of friends getting together to watch films that weren't distributed to the general public. As word got out, that small group of cinephiles turned to hundreds and the Austin Film Society (AFS) was born, honoring classic and independent film with screenings in venues all over Austin.
