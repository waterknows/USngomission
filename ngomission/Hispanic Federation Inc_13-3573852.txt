Established in 1990, the Hispanic Federation is a service-oriented membership organization that works with over 90 Latino health and human services agencies to promote the social, political and economic well-being of the Latino community. The Federation's member agencies work in the areas of education, health, elderly services, child care, HIV/AIDS, housing, immigrant services, arts and culture, and economic development. Each year, these agencies serve millions of the northeast region's most underprivileged and vulnerable Latinos. The Hispanic Federation's mission is to serve the community by building and supporting Latino institutions.
