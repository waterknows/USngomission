Centurion Ministries (CM) was founded in 1983 in Princeton, NJ. Recognized in North America as a pioneer in this field, CM has successfully reinvestigated and freed score of factually innocent people within the U.S. and Canada. We take advantage of DNA and other forensic testing to prove innocence when we can; however, most wrongful convictions do not have evidence that can be scientifically tested to prove innocence. Therefore, the bulk of our case work Is non-DNA and requires 'in-the-field' investigation of wrongful convictions that have taken place throughout the nation. At any given time CM has a case load of approximately 20 active cases, all in different stages of development.
