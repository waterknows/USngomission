The Native American Heritage Association (NAHA) is dedicated to helping Native Americans living on the tribal reservations in South Dakota. The state of South Dakota is home to some of America's most scenic landscapes, the Badlands, and also the home to the poorest people in our nation. NAHA supports the Sioux people through medical, food, fuel, and clothing programs.
