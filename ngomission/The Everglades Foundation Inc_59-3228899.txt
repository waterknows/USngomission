Founded in 1994, the Everglades Foundation is a science-based, non-profit organization dedicated solely to restoring one of the world's greatest natural ecosystems - America's Everglades. From the Kissimmee River Watershed to the St. Lucie & Caloosahatchee Rivers, and south to Florida Bay, the Everglades is the water supply for over 8 million Floridians and a major driver of Florida's economy. The Foundation advances scientifically sound and achievable solutions to reverse environmental damage to Everglades. To do so, it builds consensus among public and private organizations, forms coalitions, sets priorities and promotes a widespread understanding of the Everglades and its irreplaceable environmental and economic value.
