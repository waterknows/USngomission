Established in 1977, the mission of the National Abortion Federation (NAF) is to ensure safe, legal, and accessible abortion care to promote health and justice for women. NAF is the professional association of abortion providers in North America. We are unique among pro-choice organizations because we represent the providers who make reproductive choice a reality. Our work supports these three fundamental aspects of our mission: providing our members with the education and professional support they need to provide the highest quality abortion care; providing the medical, provider, and patient perspectives in debates about abortion policies; and providing women with the resources they need to make informed decisions about their pregnancies.
