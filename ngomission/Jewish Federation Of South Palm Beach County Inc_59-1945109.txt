The Jewish Federation of South Palm Beach County is the primary fund-raising, planning and allocating agency for one of the fastest-growing Jewish communities in North America. Incorporated in 1979, today, we have four founding-member agencies: the Adolph and Rose Levis Jewish Community Center; the Donna Klein Jewish Academy; the Jewish Association for Residential Care; and Ruth Rales Jewish Family Services. In addition, the Jewish Federation of South Palm Beach County provides its own programs and services through three key departments: the Jewish Community Foundation; the Jewish Community Relations Council; and the Jewish Education Commission.
