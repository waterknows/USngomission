PBHA strives for social justice. As a student-run organization, we draw upon the creative initiative of students and community members to foster collaboration that empowers individuals and communities. Through social service and social action, PBHA endeavors to meet community needs while advocating structural change. PBHA seeks to promote social awareness and community involvement at Harvard and beyond. PBHA is the umbrella organization for 86 student-directed programs, supported by full-time staff members. Together, these programs strive for change on multiple levels in the Boston and Cambridge communities. PBHA's dual focused mission is to provide vital resources to local communities and grow public service leaders.
