Long Island Cares is a community based organization working in partnership with other charitable agencies to fight hunger in Nassau and Suffolk Counties. We are the leading anti-hunger organization and the only food bank on Long Island. Long Island Cares was founded in 1980 by the late singer/activist Harry Chapin in response to the immediate needs of hungry Long Islanders. Long Island Cares provides emergency food where and when it is needed, sponsors programs that help families achieve self-sufficiency, and educates the general public about the causes and consequences of hunger on Long Island.
