Founded in 1981, Feeding South Florida (formerly Daily Bread Food Bank) empowers other South Florida non-profit organizations to assist people in need and improve their lives. We do this by providing food and other grocery products; and by educating and engaging our community to fight hunger and poverty. We are the South Florida affiliate of Feeding America, a member of the Florida Association of Food Banks and the largest food bank in the State of Florida. Feeding South Florida provided over 30 million pounds of food last year to nearly 600 member agencies throughout Broward, Miami-Dade, Monroe and Palm Beach Counties.
