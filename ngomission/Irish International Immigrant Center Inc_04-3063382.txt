The Irish International Immigrant Center assists immigrants from Ireland and from around the world as they integrate into American society, and with partner organizations, promotes reconciliation in Ireland. We are a vibrant welcome center that provides legal, wellness and education services, advocates for systemic change, and facilitates cross-cultural community building. Our vision is of a shared society where all people are welcomed and valued and enjoy equal opportunities, and protections.
