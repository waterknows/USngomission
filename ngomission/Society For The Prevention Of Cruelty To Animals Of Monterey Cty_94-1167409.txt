Founded in 1905, The SPCA for Monterey County's doors are open to all animals in need, including dogs, cats, small animals, barn animals, exotic animals, and wildlife. We never turn away any animal that needs our help. Our mission is to assure compassionate and humane treatment of all animals in our community. The SPCA has had a long and rich history of helping people and animals in Monterey County. Guided by our comprehensive, long-range strategic plan, The SPCA will maintain our majestic 200 acres of land for animal welfare needs, and expand our community outreach, education programs, and community collaborations administered by hundreds of volunteers and staff members.The SPCA for Monterey County is a nonprofit, independent, donor-supported humane society that has been serving the animals and people of Monterey County since 1905. The SPCA is not a chapter of any other agency and does not have a parent organization. Everything we do is made possible by you.
