Seattle Audubon Society cultivates and leads a community that values and protects birds and the natural environment. Since 1916, Seattle Audubon members and volunteers have helped protect millions of acres of important bird habitat across the Pacific Northwest. Through our environmental education, conservation advocacy, citizen science, and community engagement programs, Seattle Audubon helps connect people with birds and nature. Whether defending green spaces in our urban neighborhoods or protecting vulnerable bird populations in Puget Sound, we are on the front lines of conservation.
