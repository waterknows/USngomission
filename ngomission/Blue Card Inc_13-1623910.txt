The mission of The Blue Card is to provide direct financial assistance, with a minimum of obstacles, in a caring and dignified manner to needy Jewish survivors of Nazi persecution and their families in the United States. The Blue Card was established by the Jewish Community in 1934 in Germany to help Jews already being affected by the Nazi persecution through loss of jobs and other forms of oppression. In 1939, The Blue Card was reestablished in the United States to continue adding refugees of Nazi persecution resettling in America. The Blue Card offers its help in five types of programs: emergency cash assistance, monthly stipends, Jewish holiday gifts, emergency response, and summer vacations.
