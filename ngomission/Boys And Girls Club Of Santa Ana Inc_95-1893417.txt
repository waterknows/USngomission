The Boys & Girls Club of Santa Ana works to promote the positive and healthy development of youth, especially from disadvantaged circumstances, by providing services in a safe environment that build the skills, civility and self-confidence necessary to succeed in a competitive world. Our vision is to provide safe places and results-based programs where young people learn, grow, have life changing experiences, and establish ongoing relationships with caring adult professionals that will lead to opportunity, accomplishment and a life as productive, responsible adults.
