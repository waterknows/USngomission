Founded in 1946, the United Way of West Alabama (UWWA) seeks to determine the needs of the West Alabama community and through the support of community volunteers and donors works to solve those needs for positive changes within the West Alabama community. United Way creates opportunities by focusing on the building blocks for a good life: Education, Income/Financial Stability, & Health. United Way is helping children and youth achieve their potential through education, helping families become financially stable and independent, improving people's health, and responding to emergency and disaster needs.
