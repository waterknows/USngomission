Founded in 1982, Ronald McDonald House Charities of Greater Cincinnati provides an affordable "home away from home" for families and their children receiving medical treatment at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. Ronald McDonald House Charities also awards grants to local not-for-profit organizations serving children through a portion of donations from McDonald's customers and Global Ronald McDonald House Charities' matching funds. We work to offer all the comforts of home to every family and hospitalized child. In Spring 2009, Cincinnati's Ronald McDonald House will open its doors again to a new expansion offering 30 additional rooms, half of which are long-term suites. This expansion will allow our House to serve an additional 500 families each year.
