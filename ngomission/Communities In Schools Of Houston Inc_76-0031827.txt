Beginning in 1979, Communities In Schools of Houston (CIS) began making a difference in the stay-in-school and graduation rates among Houston area schools! The mission of CIS is to surround students with a community of support, empowering them to stay in school and achieve in life. CIS is based on the belief that programs don't change people-relationships do! CIS of Houston works with at-risk students in grades pre-K through post-secondary, by placing a full-time social service provider on the school campus to implement a student-centered, goal-oriented, solution-focused case management model, which is a process for assessing and meeting a student's needs. CIS Project Managers are committed adults who invest in at-risk students' personal and academic success, building significant relationships with students to encourage him/her to set and attain academic, personal, and career goals.
