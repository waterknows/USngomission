Since 1834, Worcester Academy has educated students to achieve the honorable. Our mission is to instill in our students the desire to learn throughout life, to engage passionately with the world around them, and to be honorable persons of strong and resourceful character. Worcester Academy is a co-ed day and boarding school for grades 6-12 and postgraduates. In the classroom, students are challenged by accomplished faculty and a classic college-preparatory curriculum that is supplemented with the most advanced educational technology. We also believe that there are many important life-lessons to be learned outside of the classroom, inherent in our diverse visual and performing arts program, competitive athletics and community service requirement.
