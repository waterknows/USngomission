The mission of DuPage PADS is to end homelessness in DuPage County. The solution to end homelessness is more complex than providing individuals with food and shelter. Founded in 1985, DuPage PADS is the largest provider of interim and permanent housing, coupled with support services in order to help individuals work toward becoming self-sufficient. These vital support services enable the individuals we help to receive case management and life coaching, employment support such as GED courses and job coaching, as well as engagement with employers-effectively stopping the cycle of homelessness.With the support of more than 130 congregations and organizations, 4,000 volunteers and numerous community advocates and other service organizations, we were able to offer hope for more than 1,398 families and individuals in our communities through housing programs and support services.DuPage PADS IS the solution to end homelessness-because when someone believes in you, everything can change.
