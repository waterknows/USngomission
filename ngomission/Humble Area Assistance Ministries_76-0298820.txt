Founded in 1990, Humble Area Assistance Ministries (HAAM) is a faith-based organization that helps community residents in crisis by providing essential resources to move towards self-sufficiency. The vision of HAAM is to meet immediate basic living needs, promote self-sufficiency, partner with other community agencies/organizations to continue to assist those in the community, and proactively seek new resources and tools to serve those in need.
