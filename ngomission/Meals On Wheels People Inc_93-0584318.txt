Meals on Wheels People was founded in 1969 with the mission to enrich the lives of seniors and assist them in maintaining independence by making nutritious food, social contacts and other resources accessible. To the extent possible we will also serve disabled, institutionalized and other nutritionally at-risk populations. We accomplish this through an organization that is community-based, emphasizes volunteer involvement, and is financially sound. Today Meals on Wheels People produces 5,000 hot, nutritious meals five days each week in a 14,000-square-foot commercial kitchen located in the heart of Multnomah Village. Meals are then delivered to 30 senior centers throughout Multnomah, Washington and Clark counties where they are served at noon to seniors in center dining rooms or sent out as Meals on Wheels to frail, homebound elderly.
