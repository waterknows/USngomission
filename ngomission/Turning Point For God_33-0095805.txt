Turning Point's mission is to deliver the unchanging Word of God to an ever-changing world. We strive to promote ministry in the lives of our listeners by teaching them to reach their own circle of influence for Jesus Christ and to build up the local church by building-up the people of the local church. We are dedicated to the daily walk of our listeners and viewers by providing Bible study resources to help them grow spiritually. The ministry is broken up into several different aspects such as radio, television and monthly giving programs like the Circle of Friends. Each message that is aired, whether over the radio or television, is presented by Dr. David Jeremiah, and the resources that we provide are derived from those messages.
