Founded in 1998, the mission of Room to Grow is to enrich the lives of babies born into poverty throughout their critical first three years of development. Room to Grow's program provides parents raising babies in poverty with one-on-one parenting support and essential baby items throughout their children's critical first three years of life. Parents expecting a baby are referred to Room to Grow by selected prenatal programs assisting low-income families. Upon their referral, parents visit Room to Grow's warm and inviting space once every three months from just before the birth of the baby until their child turns three. During their one-on-one appointments with our staff clinicians, typically lasting two hours, parents receive developmental information, customized support, and all of the needed baby items to ensure a healthy and secure start for their child.
