Legal Services for Children (LSC) was founded in 1975 as one of the first non-profit law firms in the country to provide free legal representation and social work services to children and youth. LSC's mission is to ensure that all children and youth in San Francisco Bay Area have an opportunity to be raised in a safe environment with equal access to a meaningful education and the services and supports they need to become healthy and productive young adults. LSC pioneered a unique interdisciplinary approach to legal services, employing teams of attorneys and social workers to comprehensively meet the needs of our clients. We represent children and youth in cases that include legal guardianship, dependency, school discipline, immigration, emancipation, and restraining order proceedings.
