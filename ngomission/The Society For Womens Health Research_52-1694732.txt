The Society for Women's Health Research (SWHR), a national non-profit organization based in Washington DC, is widely recognized as the thought leader in research on sex differences and is dedicated to improving women's health through advocacy, education, and research.Founded in 1990 by a group of physicians, medical researchers and health advocates, SWHR aims to bring attention to the myriad of diseases and conditions that affect women uniquely. Due to SWHR's efforts, women are now routinely included in most major medical research studies and scientists are beginning to consider biological sex as a variable in their research.
