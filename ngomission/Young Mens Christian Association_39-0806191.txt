The YMCA of the Fox Cities seeks to put Christian principles into practice by promoting youth, adult and family activities that build a healthy spirit, mind and body for all. During 2007 we provided licensed child care and educational programs for kids ages 6 weeks through 12 years. We provided swimming and sports instruction, values training and recreational activities in a wholesome environment to all skill levels for youth and adults. In addition, we provided therapeutic and rehabilitative programming to arthritic, cardiac, disabled and other special needs population. Our special population programs and workshops, targeting teens, older adults and families are designed to provide training in basic life skills such as leadership, coping, nutrition and decision making.
