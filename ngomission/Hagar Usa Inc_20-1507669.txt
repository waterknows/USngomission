The purpose of Hagar is singular; we restore broken lives. We welcome the toughest of human conditions. We stay focused on the individual. And we do whatever it takes for as long as it takes to restore life in all its fullness. Hagar is a global Christian organization that operates commercial and non-profit entities and engages in private and public sector partnerships in pursuit of its mission to restore women and children who suffer extreme human rights abuse to life in all its fullness.
