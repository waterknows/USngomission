Founded in 1968 by Frank M. Young, Theatre Under The Stars (TUTS) is dedicated to enriching life through the experience of quality musical theatre and positively impacting lives beyond the stage through innovative education and community outreach initiatives. In 2008, TUTS produced seven presentations to more than 180,000 people, and TUTS' School of Musical Theatre held 82 classes and enrolled approximately 1,435 individuals. TUTS' downtown home, the Hobby Center for the Performing Arts contains the 2,650-seat Sarofim Hall, the 500-seat Zilkha Hall, a restaurant, a parking garage, offices and classroom space, and TUTS' own theatrical boutique. The fiber-optic ceiling of Sarofim Hall now keeps TUTS under the stars all year long.
