The Free Software Foundation (FSF), founded in 1985, is dedicated to promoting computer users' rights to use, study, copy, modify, and redistribute computer programs. The FSF promotes the development and use of free software, particularly the GNU operating system and its GNU/Linux variants - and free documentation for free software. The FSF also helps to spread awareness of the ethical and political issues of freedom in the use of software. Current projects include GPL Version 3; the GPL Compliance Lab; the Free Software Directory; and Savannah, software development services provided to free software developers around the world. Additionally, FSF is committed to furthering the development of the GNU Operating System, providing development systems for GNU software maintainers.
