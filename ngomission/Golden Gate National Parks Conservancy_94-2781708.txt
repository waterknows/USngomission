The Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy is the nonprofit membership organization created to preserve the Golden Gate National Parks, enhance the experiences of park visitors, and build a community dedicated to

conserving the parks for the future. Since its inception in 1981, the Parks Conservancy has provided the Golden Gate National Parks with $140 million in support. Currently, the Conservancy has more than 13,500 members. We steward more than 80,400 acres across more than 30 spectacular park sites; foster environmental awareness in 18,000 school children every year; and protect 1,200 plant and animals species, while growing over 140,000 native plants each year for restoration work park wide.
