The mission of United Methodist Children's Home is to follow the example of Christ by embracing all God's children . . .one child, one family at a time. The Children's Home makes a real difference in the lives of children. It has helped to transform the lives of thousands of hurting children since 1890. Many of our alumni are now successful adults who are giving back to the communities which gave to them. We presently offer the following services: residential programs for youth, and for young mothers & infants; foster care programs; family preservation and support services; and spiritual life and development programs.
