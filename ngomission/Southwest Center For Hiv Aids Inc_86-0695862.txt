Southwest Center for HIV/AIDS is the largest clinical trial, education, behavioral health and nutrition support center dedicated to fighting HIV and AIDS in the Southwestern United States. Southwest Center for HIV/AIDS (formerly Body Positive) was founded in 1990 by Kirk Baxter. The Center's vision, "leading the fight against HIV and AIDS" is carried out through our mission of reducing infection, improving quality of life and contributing to worldwide research. Today, hundreds of thousands of people around the world are taking HIV- and AIDS-fighting drugs that earned Federal Drug Administration approval, thanks in part to the Center's clinical trials and biomedical research program.
