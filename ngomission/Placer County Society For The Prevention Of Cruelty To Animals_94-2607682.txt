Placer SPCA works to enhance the lives of companion animals and support the human-animal bond through adoption, reunification, education and affordable spay and neuter services. In addition to finding permanent loving homes for homeless companion animals, the Placer SPCA strives to promote responsible and successful pet ownership and provide essential resources to ensure the health of the animals in our community. Our vision is that: every adoptable companion animal in Placer County has a home; every lost companion animal in Placer County is reunited with its owner; every dog and cat owner in Placer County has access to affordable spay and neuter services; and that every companion animal is treated with kindness and respect.
