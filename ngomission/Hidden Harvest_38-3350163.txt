Founded in 1994, HIDDEN HARVEST strives to alleviate hunger and end food waste in the Bay, Midland and Saginaw region by providing a safe and coordinated system of rescuing surplus food and redistributing it to feed people in need. Each day, HIDDEN HARVEST rescues thousands of pounds of food from hospitals, hotels, restaurants, wholesalers, bakeries, grocery stores, and other health department or USDA approved sources. This food is immediately delivered free of charge, to soup kitchens, food pantries, shelters, and other nonprofit community programs that help many of our neighbors every day.
