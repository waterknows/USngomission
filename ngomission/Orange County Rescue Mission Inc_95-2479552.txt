The Orange County Rescue Mission's goal is to minister the love of Jesus Christ to the least, the last, and the lost of our community through the provision of assistance in the areas of guidance, counseling, education, job training, shelter, food, clothing, health care and independent living communities. The Mission was formed as a faith based organization in 1963. Since that time the Mission has shared hope through Jesus Christ to those without hope in Orange County. Our programs are designed to give comprehensive services that move homeless men, women and children to self-sufficiency.
