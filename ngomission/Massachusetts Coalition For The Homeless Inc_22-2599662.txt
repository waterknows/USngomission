Founded in 1981, the Massachusetts Coalition for the Homeless (MCH) is committed to ensuring that everyone has a place to call home. MCH's policy work and programs address this issue on three fronts. First, the Coalition provides bridges over short-term crisis, helping homeless and at-risk people to relocate quickly into new housing or avoid homelessness altogether. Second, MCH works to ensure adequate and appropriate shelter if homelessness is unavoidable. Third, MCH advocates for long-term solutions to the housing crisis, promoting government support for income and housing resources so that all Massachusetts residents can obtain and maintain safe, affordable housing. As MCH works to address the causes, not just the symptoms of homelessness, it remains committed to creating opportunities for families and individuals to advocate for their own needs.
