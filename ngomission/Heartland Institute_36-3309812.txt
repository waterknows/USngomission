The Heartland Institute is a national, non-partisan research and education organization founded in Chicago in 1984. Heartland's mission is to discover and promote free-market solutions to social and economic problems. Such solutions include parental choice in education, choice and personal responsibility in health care, market-based approaches to environmental protection, privatization of public services, and deregulation in areas where property rights and markets do a better job than government bureaucracies. The Heartland Institute produces six monthly publications on budget and tax issues, environment and climate, health care reform, information technology and telecommunications, school reform, and finance, insurance, and real estate.
