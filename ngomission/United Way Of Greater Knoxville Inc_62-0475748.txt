With roots tracing back to 1922, United Way of Greater Knoxville brings together resources to improve the lives of people in our community by helping them achieve their potential for self sufficiency. Here in Knoxville, we're focused on critical issues like healthcare, education for adults and children, and the rising number of working people living on the edge of poverty. United Way's work is focused on the building blocks for a good life: the Community Care Fund, the Non-Profit Management Center, the Success by Six program, and the Medical Health Home Initiative.
