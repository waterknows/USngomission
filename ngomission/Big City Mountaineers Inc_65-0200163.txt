Big City Mountaineers transforms the lives of under-served urban youth through wilderness mentoring expeditions that instill critical life skills. We partner with community-based youth organizations and caring adult volunteers who act as mentors in the field to help young people realize their potential. Our curriculum improves integrity, self- esteem, responsibility, decision-making abilities and communication skills. We also rely on the support of our Summit for Someone climbers. Our SFS climbers take on two formidable commitments: mentally and physically preparing to climb one of North America's most challenging peaks, and raising thousands of dollars. All to help improve the lives of kids they might never meet.
