Founded in 1924 by a group of New York bankers, The New York Community Trust is one of the country's oldest and largest community foundations. The Trust helps charitable New Yorkers make a real difference: We offer donors a number of flexible, efficient, and rewarding ways to accomplish their charitable giving, now or later; we work with lawyers and financial advisors to help their clients incorporate charity into their financial and estate plans; through the generosity of generations of New Yorkers, we support thousands of the City's best nonprofits and the extraordinary people who help make our town a great place to live and work.
