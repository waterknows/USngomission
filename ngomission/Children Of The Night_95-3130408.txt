Children of the Night is the only place in North America where a child can call from a seedy motel or truck stop anywhere in the United States, reach a skilled child care worker 24/7 who knows how to intervene with the police, escape from a dangerous condition with our help, take pre-arranged transportation to an airport, board a pre-paid airline, meet a child care worker at Los Angeles International Airport and arrive in the safe, loving, nurturing Children of the Night home within 24 hours of his/her initial call for help.Children of the Night has rescued over 10,000 American children from sex trafficking/prostitution right here in the United States--that is more children than all of the other sex trafficking programs combined.The Children of the Night home is open to child prostitutes throughout the United States, and the Children of the Night hotline is ready and able to rescue these children 24 hours a day.
