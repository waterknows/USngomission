Fresh Lifelines for Youth (FLY) prevents juvenile crime and incarceration through legal education, leadership training, and one-on-one mentoring. Research based and outcome driven, FLY's programs inspire and empower youth in the juvenile justice system, and youth at-risk for system involvement to alter the trajectory of their lives by helping them identify, build upon, and re-direct their strengths. Over the last 10 years, FLY has helped nearly 10,000 marginalized and under-served youth gain the life skills and character needed to avoid the criminal justice system and transform into positive community leaders.
