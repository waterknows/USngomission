Founded in 2000, ForestEthics is a nonprofit environmental organization with staff and board members in Canada and the United States. Our mission is to protect Endangered Forests and wild places, wildlife, and human well-being. Climate change, which threatens to undermine all of our conservation efforts, is also one of our campaign focus areas. We catalyze environmental leadership among industry, governments and communities by running hard-hitting and highly effective campaigns that leverage public dialogue and pressure to achieve our goals. Our current campaigns focus on wild places in Canada. Our efforts have transformed the environmental practices of Fortune 500 companies including Dell, Staples, Office Depot, Victoria's Secret, Williams-Sonoma, and many others.
