San Antonio Metropolitan Ministries, founded in 1983, is an interfaith ministry whose mission is to help the homeless and those at risk of becoming homeless attain self-sufficiency. SAMMinistries does this by providing transitional housing, employment development, education assistance, and San Antonio's largest resource for homeless prevention services to families and individuals in Bexar County. SAMMinistries also provides volunteers opportunities to be renewed and fulfilled as they serve.
