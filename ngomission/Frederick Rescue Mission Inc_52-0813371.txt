The Frederick Rescue Mission is a Christ-centered ministry providing residential programs to the homeless and chemically dependent, food to the hungry, and clothing and furniture to the needy, and connection within our community through relationships. The Mission serves the community both through emergency services and transitional shelters. The emergency services we provide help to change and bring hope to lives NOW, while our transitional shelters not only help for today, but bring about life changes that last for ETERNITY.
