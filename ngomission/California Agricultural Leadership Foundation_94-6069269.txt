The California Agricultural Leadership Foundation is committed to leadership training and transformational learning experiences in partnership with four California universities. We support the California Agricultural Leadership Program, which enhances the long-term viability of California agriculture through leadership development. Each year, up to 60 fellows study business, government, economics, and urban affairs in a two-year that contains both domestic and internationally based seminars. We also support the Washington, D.C. Educational Fellowship Program (or D.C. Exchange), hosted by the Ag Leadership Alumni Council. It educates D.C.-based decision makers about current issues and complex challenges facing California's farmers and ranchers.
