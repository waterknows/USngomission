The mission of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) organization is to prepare young people to make ethical and moral choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Law. The National Capital Area Council (NCAC), established in 1910, works to accomplish the mission of the BSA in such an exemplary manner as to be recognized by our public as the premier youth organization in the communities we serve and by other councils and the National Council as second to none in all our endeavors. The NCAC is a class 200 council, (one of the largest) and is geographically comprised of ten counties in Northern Virginia, six counties in Maryland, and the District of Columbia.
