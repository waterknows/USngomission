Earth Day Network (EDN) grew out of the original Earth Day in 1970. EDN works to grow and diversify the environmental movement worldwide, and to mobilize it as the most effective vehicle for promoting a healthy, sustainable planet. We pursue our mission through education, politics, events, and consumer activism. We are a driving force steering environmental awareness around the world. Through EDN, activists connect, interact, and have an impact on their communities, creating positive change in local, national, and global policies. Earth Day is the only event celebrated simultaneously around the globe by people of all backgrounds, faiths and nationalities. More than a billion people participate in Earth Day each year.
