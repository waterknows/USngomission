Catholic Answers is an apostolate dedicated to serving Christ by bringing the fullness of Catholic truth to the world. We help good Catholics become better Catholics, bring lapsed Catholics home, and lead non-Catholics into the fullness of the faith. Founded in 1979, Catholic Answers has become one of the nation's largest lay-run apostolates of Catholic apologetics and evangelization.
