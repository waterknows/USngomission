The Gateways mission is to nurture and sustain Jewish identity, strengthen a connection to Israel and empower participants to make informed decisions about their Jewish future. We accomplish this through a wide array of meaningful immersion based educational and social programs led by a robust leadership team of renowned scholars and talented educational innovators.
