Youth Service America (YSA) improves communities by increasing the number and the diversity of young people, ages 5-25, serving in substantive roles. Founded in 1986, YSA supports a global culture of engaged youth committed to a lifetime of service, learning leadership, and achievement. The impact of YSA's work through service and service-learning is measured in student achievement, workplace readiness, and healthy communities. Our goals are to: educate youth, teachers, community organizations, media, and public officials in the power of youth as problem solvers and engage children and youth as volunteers, as academic achievers, and as community leaders.
