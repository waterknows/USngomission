Friendship Home's mission is to enrich the lives of individuals with developmental disabilities and their families by providing quality respite care and support services in a safe and caring environment. Our programs build self-esteem and community involvement for our participants, while providing support for their families who may become overwhelmed and isolated by the daily demands of caring for their family members. While our programs directly address the needs of individuals with developmental disabilities and their families, we are proud of our efforts to serve the entire community by raising up the people that we serve as vital contributors to our communities.
