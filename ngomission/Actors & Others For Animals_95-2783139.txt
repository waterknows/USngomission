Founded in 1971, Actors and Others for Animals is dedicated to the promotion of the humane treatment of animals. Our main mission is to curb the pet overpopulation problem by subsidizing spay/neuter surgeries. Together with other vital services, we are there to help pet guardians living on a low and/or fixed income care for their beloved companions. We are a community based animal welfare organization serving the greater Los Angeles area and surrounding counties. Our programs include: pet overpopulation, spay/neuter help, pet care, emergency medical help, pet-assisted therapy, humane education, and a feral cats assistance program.
