Mobile Loaves & Fishes empowers communities into a lifestyle of service with the homeless. We provide food and clothing and promote dignity to our homeless brothers and sisters in need. MLF offers flexible micro-enterprise opportunities for the chronically homeless to use their individual talents and skills to earn a modest living income. Our "Community First" program teaches the principles and practices of organic and sustainable agriculture while encouraging residents and homeless individuals to cultivate relationships and develop community.
