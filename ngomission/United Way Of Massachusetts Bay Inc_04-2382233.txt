United Way of Massachusetts Bay and Merrimack Valley brings our communities together to help improve people's lives and strengthen the neighborhoods in our region. United Way was built on the idea that if we are to make meaningful, lasting change, we have make it easier for these efforts to come together. To make the greatest impact possible, United Way aligns a network of more than 200 independent health and human service under the same set of community goals. According to our common goals, we seek to: nurture children so that they are prepared to enter school ready to learn; provide youth with adult guidance to give them positive options for the future; and ensure that families have safe permanent homes as well as the skills and opportunities to build better futures.
