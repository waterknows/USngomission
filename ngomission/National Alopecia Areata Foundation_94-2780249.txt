The National Alopecia Areata Foundation (NAAF) supports research to find a cure or acceptable treatment for alopecia areata, supports those with the disease, and educates the public about alopecia areata. Founded in 1981, NAAF accomplishes this by funding research and research workshops that add to the scientific knowledge about alopecia areata, its causes, and different treatments; providing local support and education for people with alopecia areata and their families; informing the public about alopecia areata; advocating the concerns of people affected alopecia areata; and creating and distributing educational materials to health professionals as well as those affected, so that all may better understand alopecia areata. Alopecia areata is a highly unpredictable, autoimmune skin disease resulting in the loss of hair on the scalp and elsewhere on the body.
