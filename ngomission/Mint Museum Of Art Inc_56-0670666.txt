Two unique museums make up The Mint Museums: the Mint Museum of Art (MMA) and the Mint Museum of Craft + Design (MMCD). Opened in 1936 as North Carolina's first art museum, the MMA is a rich and diverse resource with noted collections of American art, pre-Columbian art, American and European ceramics, American decorative arts, historic costumes and accessories, African art, Asian art, historic maps, contemporary art and photography. Enhancing the permanent collections is an active schedule of changing exhibitions and education programs. The MMCD features a permanent collection documenting contemporary studio craft, tracing the movement's historical roots in the 19th century and its relationship to traditional decorative arts and industrial design.
