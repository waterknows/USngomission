United Way of Blount County is advancing the common good by creating opportunities for a better life for all.

We all win when a child succeeds in school, when families are financially stable and when people have good health. That's why United Way is focused on the building blocks for a better life by supporting programs that help kids succeed, strengthen and support families, promote self-sufficiency, improve people's health, and protect community well-being. Our goal is to create lasting changes in our community by addressing the root causes of Blount County's problems.
