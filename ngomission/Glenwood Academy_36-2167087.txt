With a reputation for excellence for over 125 years, Glenwood Academy is greater Chicago's only boarding school that offers a safe, nurturing environment for disadvantaged children. Willing and able to learn but constrained by difficult social and economic situations, each year approximately 150 of these children come to Glenwood to live and learn - both in and out of the classroom. Here, young minds are challenged, character built, family relationships strengthened, and potential attained. More than just a school, Glenwood is a bright new world of promise for disadvantaged children with the ability and desire to succeed. Glenwood is a special organization whose services meet the needs of a very specific population - children whose future successes are threatened by their surroundings. Glenwood programs are centered on parental partnership and preventative intervention for economically and socially disadvantaged children from low-income, single-parent families undergoing crisis.
