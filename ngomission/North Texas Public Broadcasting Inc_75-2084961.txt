KERA 13 and KERA 90.1 are the public radio and television stations for North Texas, touching the lives of 2.5 million people every week via television, radio and the Internet. Serving our local communities with thought-provoking, award-winning television and radio programs that offer insights and serve as an outlet for a diversity of voices is our top priority. We produce over 1,000 hours of original local radio programming, and high-definition television content including weekly programs and quarterly documentaries that focus on issues important to our region and our state. One of the key parts of our mission is to touch the lives of people throughout the communities we serve. At KERA, we realize that a big part of our work happens off the air. This includes extensive work with schools and teaching organizations throughout North Texas.
