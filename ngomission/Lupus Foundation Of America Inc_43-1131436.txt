The Lupus Foundation of America (LFA) is the foremost national nonprofit voluntary health organization dedicated to finding the causes of and cure for lupus, and providing support, services, and hope to all people affected by lupus. The LFA and its nationwide network of nearly 300 chapters, branches and support groups conduct programs of research, education, advocacy, and support. An estimated 1.5 million Americans and at least five million people worldwide have some form of lupus. Lupus is a chronic autoimmune disease that results from an unbalanced immune system that becomes destructive to any organ in the body. Lupus is unpredictable and potentially fatal, yet no satisfactory treatment or cure exists.
