The Kentucky Opera aims to give performance of operas and operettas of all types and to perform all acts and functions necessary or desirable in connection with the training and development of competent young performers in the field of opera. The company is committed to increasing its young audience through the development of several educational initiatives designed to make opera more accessible. Meeting tremendous success in its inaugural year, Kentucky Opera launched the Music! Words! Opera! program in Kentucky and Southern Indiana in May of 2000. Developed by OPERA America, the yearlong program trains teams of teachers to facilitate students to create their very own opera. With help from teachers, local artists and musicians and Kentucky Opera professionals, the students compose music, write librettos, design sets and costumes and perform their opera in front of a live audience.
