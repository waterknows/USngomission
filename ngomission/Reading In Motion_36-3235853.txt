Reading In Motion's works to get every at-risk student reading at or above grade level within the first years of school through the power and discipline of the arts. To accomplish this, we partner with schools and teachers to create and deliver an innovative, supplemental reading program that uses music and drama to engage students. Reading In Motion is currently in 140 Chicago-area classrooms and has helped more than 45,000 students since it was founded in 1983.
