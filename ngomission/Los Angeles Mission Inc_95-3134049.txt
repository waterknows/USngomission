The Los Angeles Mission exists to provide help, hope and opportunity to men, women and children in need. We see each individual as a spiritual person of worth and dignity and worthy of assistance in their journey. Our vision is to see individuals and families set free from addictions and homelessness, transformed by God to become physically and spiritually healthy; educationally equipped to participate in society and sustain housing; and encouraged to create relationships of love and service to others. We seek to help those who have been abused and neglected to find a better life. We seek to help those who have become addicted to understand their addictions, to expect physical healing and to live in ways that are healthy to soul, mind and body.
