The ALS Association Florida Chapter leads the fight to treat and cure ALS through global research and nationwide advocacy while also empowering people with Lou Gehrig's Disease and their families to live fuller lives by providing them with compassionate care and support. Through care management and Florida Chapter programs, our experienced team of Care Coordinators provides essential assistance for patients and their families at every stage of the disease. To live each day with ALS, your Care Coordinator will help you manage and maintain your physical and emotional health, navigate the insurance and health care systems and gather resources.
