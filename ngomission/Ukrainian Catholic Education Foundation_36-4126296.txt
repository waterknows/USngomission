Established in 1997, the Ukrainian Catholic Education Foundation (UCEF) informs Americans about the academic and financial needs of the Ukrainian Catholic Church and its educational institutions in Ukraine. We foster the communion of Ukrainian Americans with the Ukrainian nation and of Roman Catholics in the West with the largest Eastern Catholic Church. The Catholic Church in Ukraine was persecuted by the Soviets from 1946 to 1990; all of its activities were driven underground and its properties were confiscated. The UCEF Institutional Support Program helps educational and religious institutions in Ukraine to meet present needs and develop endowments for the future.
