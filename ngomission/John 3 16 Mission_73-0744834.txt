John 3:16 Mission is an interdenominational Christian ministry that provides food, shelter, clothing and rehabilitation services to Tulsa's homeless and at-risk population. Founded in 1952, the Mission has served thousands of homeless men, women and children through the decades, showing them the way to a better life through Jesus Christ. Our shelter provides a safe refuge from the street each night for up to 110 men. We also serve around 250 meals each day to the homeless and to men enrolled in our recovery program. Additionally, the Mission operates a Family and Youth Center (FYC) located in north Tulsa. The FYC provides material, spiritual and educational support to at-risk, low-income families living in inner-city environments.
