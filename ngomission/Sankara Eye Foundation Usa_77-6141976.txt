Founded in 1998, the mission of the Sankara Eye Foundation, USA (SEF, USA) is to realize the goal of 20/20 vision for the people of India by the year 2020. We initiate and drive community eye care activities in India by working with eye care organizations such as Sankara Eye Society, which runs the Sankara Eye Hospital in Coimbatore. SEF, USA has played a significant role in increasing the number of free surgeries eight fold to its current projected annual rate of about 70,000.
