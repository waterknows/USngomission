The Children's Discovery Museum of San Jose (CDM) serves the needs of children, families and schools as a center for learning and discovery. In its unique environment, children actively make connections among ideas, people and cultures. The Museum's programs encourage children to define their role in and contribution to both local and global communities. Encompassing the broad themes of community, connections and creativity, exhibits invite self-directed, open-ended explorations, while programs provide facilitated, focused, and sustained interactions. Since opening in 1990, the Museum has welcomed over five million visitors and has offered new interactive exhibits each year that respond to children's diverse educational needs.
