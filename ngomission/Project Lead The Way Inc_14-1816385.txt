Project Lead The Way (PLTW) is the nation's leading provider of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) programs. As a nonprofit organization, PLTW's mission is simple: prepare students for the global economy. PLTW's world-class, activity-, project-, and problem-based curriculum and high-quality teacher professional development model, combined with an engaged network of educators and corporate partners, help students develop the skills needed to succeed in our global economy. Courses are designed to complement math and science courses offered by a school and in some instances are used as the core curriculum. PLTW programs can be found in over 5,000 elementary, middle, and high schools in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. 100% of all philanthropic gifts go directly to support grants for schools, student and teacher scholarships, PLTW event sponsorship, or donor-approved projects.
