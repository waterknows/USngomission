Founded in 1981, the mission of the Chrysalis Shelter for Victims of Domestic Violence is to lead our community to broad-based solutions to prevent domestic abuse. For over 34 years, Chrysalis has been servicing the needs of women, children and men throughout the Valley who are trying to break the cycle of violence and abuse with a wide array of comprehensive services. The number of lives affected by Chrysalis has grown fourfold since its inception, with more than 1,200 individuals now being helped each year through the efforts of Chrysalis staff and volunteers.
