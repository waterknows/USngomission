Treehouse is Washington's leading nonprofit organization addressing the essential education and enrichment needs of kids in foster care. The youth Treehouse serves struggle against tremendous odds: backgrounds of abuse and neglect, parental substance abuse, low incomes, and moves from foster home to foster home while in the care of the state. Treehouse helps 8,000 kids in foster care each year through programs that help them succeed in school, fulfill key material needs, and provide important childhood experiences every child deserves. Treehouse is dedicated to closing the achievement gap between foster children and their peers, and has set an ambitious goal that foster youth in King County will graduate from high school at the same rate as their peers with a plan for their future by 2017. Treehouse gives foster kids a childhood and a future.
