GreatSchools is an independent organization that improves education by inspiring parents to get involved. It empowers parents with information and tools so they can choose the best school for their children, support their children's education, and improve schools in their communities. Parents choose GreatSchools to connect with each other - to find the right schools, to share stories and advice, and to get their parenting questions answered. Today, GreatSchools features more than one million parent ratings and reviews nationwide for more than 200,000 PreK-12 schools.
