MAZON: A Jewish Response to Hunger is a national nonprofit organization working to end hunger among people of all faiths and backgrounds in the United States and Israel. Founded in 1985, MAZON, which means "food" in Hebrew, was the first national organization to rally the American Jewish community around the issue of hunger, and remains the only national Jewish organization dedicated exclusively to that same cause. MAZON works to ensure that nutritious food is available for and accessible by all those at risk of hunger. MAZON employs three interrelated strategies to advance its mission: (1) advocacy and education - to raise awareness about the prevalence of hunger and rally American Jews in the fight to end it once and for all; (2) partnership grantmaking - to empower anti-hunger organizations to work on behalf of hungry people in their communities; and (3) strategic initiatives - to advance knowledge and increase capacity within the anti-hunger movement.
