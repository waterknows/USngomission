Formed in 1976, the Boys & Girls Clubs of Truckee Meadows' mission is to enhance the quality of life for children ages 6-18, in the Truckee Meadows. We have a commitment to create healthy children, in body and mind, with a sense of competence, usefulness, responsibility, belonging, and influence through diverse programs and community involvement. The Boys & Girls Club of Truckee Meadows has been changing young lives since 1976. Today, our clubhouses are located on throughout the Reno Sparks community, providing opportunities that change lives and create the productive citizens and leaders of tomorrow.
