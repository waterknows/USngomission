The Indianapolis Urban League (IUL) was founded in the fall of 1965 as a non-partisan, interracial community-based social service/civil rights organization. The mission of the IUL is to assist African Americans, other minorities, and disadvantaged individuals to achieve social and economic equality. The Indianapolis Urban League implements its mission through: providing direct services that help individuals and communities help themselves; "Building Bridges" among the races, collaborating with compatible organizations of all segments of our society; technical assistance, fact finding and information dissemination; and engaging in principled advocacy, community mobilization, social marketing, and communication on behalf of those we serve.
