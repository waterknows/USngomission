Habitat for Humanity of Citrus County (HFHCC) is an ecumenical Christian housing ministry seeking to eliminate poverty housing, and to make decent shelter a matter of conscience and action. Habitat invites people from all walks of life to work together in partnership to build houses with families in need. Since their founding in 1993, HFHCC has increased the number of houses we build each year in Inverness, Crystal River, Homosassa and Hernando. Partner families pay a small down payment and maintain a no-interest mortgage. They also invest hundreds of hours of labor into building their own homes and the homes of others. They work alongside generous Habitat volunteers who donate time, skills and energy to help build the houses.
