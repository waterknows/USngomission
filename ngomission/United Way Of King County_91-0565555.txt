Founded in 1921, United Way of King County mobilizes our community in ways that no single agency, individual, or government can to enhance the ability of people to care for one another. We do this by bringing the community together to address critical issues such as early learning and homelessness; investing in programs that provide the education, jobs, shelter, food and health people need to be successful; and by encouraging people to contribute money and time to improve the community. Early learning and ending homelessness are two of our community's most pressing issues. We are also focused on older adults; children, youth and families; domestic violence and sexual assault; health; job training and employment; and system support.
