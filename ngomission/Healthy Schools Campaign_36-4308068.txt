Healthy Schools Campaign advocates for policies and practices that allow all students, teachers and staff to learn and work in a healthy school environment. We teach and empower others to advocate for children to have fresh air, healthy food and physical activity to shape their lifelong learning and health. Since our founding in 2002, we've engaged parents, teachers, community leaders and students in this process, and we've built a strong base of support along the way. As that base has grown, our work has taken on a national scope while maintaining strong local relevance in our hometown of Chicago. Today, Healthy Schools Campaign continues to advocate for changes that will make a positive difference in children's health, well-being and readiness to succeed, at school and in life.
