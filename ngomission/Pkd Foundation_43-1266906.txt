The PKD Foundation is a non-for-profit organization dedicated to fighting polycystic kidney disease (PKD). The mission of the Foundation is to promote programs of research, advocacy, education, support and awareness in order to discover treatments and a cure for polycystic kidney disease and improve the lives of all it affects. To fulfill our mission and discover treatments for PKD, the PKD Foundation has launched an integrated research initiative focused on "Accelerating Treatments to Patients," which is designed to speed up the development of treatments for PKD. Key components of this initiative include drug repurposing, targeted research grants, tissue donation, clinical trials and much more. In addition to funding research and educational programs, the PKD Foundation provides a forum for patients, family and friends through more than 60 volunteer-led Chapters across the country.
