Established in 1983, The Parish School's (TPS) mission is to identify, educate, and empower children who have language and learning differences. The Parish School specializes in early language intervention and individualized instruction with a focus on the education of the whole child. The Parish School is the only school in Houston, public or private, which offers a multi-age, language-based, developmental curriculum for children 18 months through fifth grade. Children served have communication and learning differences, but average to above average learning potential. TPS utilizes a classroom based therapy program implemented by certified teachers and speech/language pathologists. Classroom ratios are low and treatment/education plans are individualized to maximize the success of each child.
