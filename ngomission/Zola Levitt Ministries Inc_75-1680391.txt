Zola Levitt Ministries is principally a teaching and evangelistic association. Our national television program, Zola Levitt Presents, teaches the bible with an emphasis on Israel, prophecy, and the Jewish roots of Christianity. Our free monthly newsletter (Levitt Letter) gives a concise biblical perspective with updates on recent events in Israel. Our Institute of Jewish-Christian Studies correspondence course teaches the Jewish roots of the Christian faith to more than 3,000 currently enrolled students. Our online store carries a large number of teaching materials. We also offer several tours each year to Israel, Greece and locations in the United States. Zola Levitt Ministries has sent hundreds of books to the Holy Land and planted thousands of trees throughout Israel.
