We aspire to be the premier youth serving organization in the city, by reducing crime, promoting character development, and improving educational outcomes. We do this by having Philadelphia Police Officers, supported by civilians, offer sports and other educational and cultural programs to youth in centers in some of the city's highest crime and lowest income neighborhoods. PAL Centers are safe havens, offering a variety programs and other events to attract, engage, and, develop more than 15,000 of Philadelphia's youth.
