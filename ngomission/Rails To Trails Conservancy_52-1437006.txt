The mission of Rails-to-Trails Conservancy (RTC) is to create a nationwide network of trails from former rail lines and connecting corridors to build healthier places for healthier people. Since its beginning in 1986, RTC has supported the tremendous growth and development of rail-trails. Today, there are more than 1,500 preserved pathways that form the backbone of a growing trail system that spans communities, regions, states and, indeed, the entire country. We remain dedicated to the creation of a nationwide network of trails. Further, Rails-to-Trails Conservancy is committed to enhancing the health of America's environment, transportation, economy, neighborhoods and people - ensuring a better future made possible by trails and the connections they inspire.
