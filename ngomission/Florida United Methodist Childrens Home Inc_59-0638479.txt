The Florida United Methodist Children's Home empowers children and families to experience God's love and care as revealed in the ministry of Jesus Christ. Children come because of sexual abuse, physical abuse, abandonment or other conflicts that have made a normal family life impossible. The children live in one of thirteen cottages. Our campus residents' ages range from 5-18 and they are enrolled in local public schools from kindergarten through high school or junior college. Tutoring is available to help each student. Opportunities are available for residents who qualify for higher education to attend Florida colleges and universities. Many residents receive advanced training in vocational skills in place of formal higher education.
