The North American Conference on Ethiopian Jewry (NACOEJ) is a non-profit organization founded in 1982 with four mandates: to help Ethiopian Jews survive in Ethiopia, to assist them in reaching Israel, to aid in their absorption into Israeli society, and to preserve their unique and ancient culture. In Ethiopia, NACOEJ provides food, education, and religious programs for about 8,700 Jews. In Israel, NACOEJ's work includes an after-school program of intensive education assistance for over 1,100 Ethiopian elementary school children, a high school sponsorship program to help over 1,300 Ethiopian teens attain a quality high school education, and a college sponsorship program that enables over 300 Ethiopian students to pursue university degrees.
