Founded in 1976, Foodlink is a Feeding America regional food bank which rescues and redistributes over nine million pounds of food annually to a network of 550 member agencies in a 10 county area in Central and Western New York. Foodlink's vision is to end hunger, build self-sufficiency, and foster nutritional wellness. The Foodlink Food Bank works with area food retailers, manufacturers and wholesalers to acquire, sort, store and redistribute food to our member charity programs - especially soup kitchens, shelters and emergency food pantries. In addition, Foodlink provides food to hundreds of non-emergency programs such as group homes, day cares, senior centers and camps.
