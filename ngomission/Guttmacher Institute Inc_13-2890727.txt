Founded in 1968, the Guttmacher Institute advances sexual and reproductive health worldwide through an interrelated program of social science research, policy analysis and public education. The Institute seeks to generate new ideas, encourage enlightened public debate, and promote sound policy and program development on issues ranging from abortion and family planning to sex education and HIV prevention. For more than four decades, Guttmacher has consistently demonstrated that scientific evidence - when reliably collected and analyzed, compellingly presented and systematically disseminated - can make a difference in policies, programs and medical practice.
