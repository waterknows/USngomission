College Possible was founded in 2000 because far too many college-capable low-income students fail to earn admission to college and complete their degree. A student from an upper income family is ten times as likely to earn a college degree as a low-income student. This trend has been widely identified not only as a fundamental problem of injustice, but also as a factor that will inhibit our country's ability to compete in the global economy in the years ahead. By providing low-income students with both the guidance and the basic tools necessary to compete effectively, College Possible has demonstrated that its program can dramatically improve students' chances of earning a college degree. To date, 98% of our students have earned admission to college and nearly 80 percent have graduated or are persisting towards their degree.
