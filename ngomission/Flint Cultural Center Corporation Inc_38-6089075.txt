Established in 1992, the Flint Cultural Center Corporation (FCCC) is committed to making sure the Flint Cultural Center continues to be a vibrant and comfortable gathering place for everyone in our community by taking care of the campus grounds and buildings, coordinating Cultural Center campus-wide programs and events, and directly supporting its member organizations: Longway Planetarium, Sloan Museum, and The Whiting. The FCCC works to foster cultural activity and community vitality through history, science and the arts. The FCCC will position the Flint Cultural Center as the premier regional destination, educational resource, and entertainment venue for history, science and the arts.
