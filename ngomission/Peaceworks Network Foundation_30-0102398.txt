OneVoice Movement, conceived in 2002 and guided by The PeaceWorks Foundation, is an international grassroots movement that amplifies the voice of mainstream Israelis and Palestinians, empowering them to propel their elected representatives toward the two-state solution. The Movement works to forge consensus for conflict resolution and build a human infrastructure capable of mobilizing the people towards a negotiated, comprehensive and permanent agreement between Israel and Palestine. OneVoice Movement provides educational instruction on conflict resolution in communities worldwide to promote peace and condemn violence, with emphasis on cross-cultural understanding through interactive communication.
