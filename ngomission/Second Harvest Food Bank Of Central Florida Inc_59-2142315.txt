The Second Harvest Food Bank of Central Florida collects, stores and distributes donated food to more than 500 partner agencies in six Central Florida counties. We fight hunger in Central Florida by: providing access to food and other grocery products; promoting and supporting the development of our partner agencies; mobilizing leaders and communities by bringing visibility to the invisible problem of hunger and poverty; and by developing more holistic and county specific solutions to hunger. In fiscal year 2011-2012, we provided nearly 36 million pounds of food resources for our local community, which translates into approximately 24 million meals for people in need.
