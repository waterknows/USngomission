Founded in 1998, the Emerald Coast Children's Advocacy Center works to prevent child abuse and neglect, protect children in Okaloosa and Walton Counties, and restore the lives of child abuse and neglect victims. The Center provides services which prevent child abuse; reduce the trauma of sexual and physical abuse; protect and treat child abuse victims and their families while holding offenders accountable; and restore the lives and futures of abused, neglected, and drug endangered children and their families. Direct services include crisis intervention, mental health counseling, providing for the needs of children (clothes, food), and case management.
