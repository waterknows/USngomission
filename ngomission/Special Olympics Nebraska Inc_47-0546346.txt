Special Olympics Nebraska serves over 3,000 individuals 8 to 83 years of age in over 110 communities in Nebraska. Our mission is to provide year-round sports training and athletic competition in a variety of Olympic-type sports for children and adults with intellectual disabilities, giving them continuing opportunities to develop physical fitness, demonstrate courage, experience joy, and participate in a sharing of gifts, skills, and friendships with their families, and other Special Olympics athletes and the community. Benefits of participation in Special Olympics include improved physical fitness and motor skills, greater self-confidence, friendships, a more positive self-image, and increased family support.
