World Relief empowers the local church to serve the most vulnerable.



Founded in 1944, the Mission of World Relief, as originated within the National Association of Evangelicals, is to work with, for and from the Church to relieve human suffering, poverty and hunger worldwide in the name of Jesus Christ. Together, World Relief and partner churches are saving lives and restoring hope through ministries that address poverty, disease, hunger, persecution and the effects of war and disasters. We meet suffering people's physical, emotional and spiritual needs - showing them that the Church cares because Jesus loves them. Our programs include disaster response, child development, maternal and child health, AIDS, agriculture, microfinance, refugee care, immigrant services, and trafficking victim protection.
