Founded in 1982, Chicago Children's Museum (CCM) works to create a community where play and learning connect. CCM's primary audience is children up through the fifth grade including their families, along with the school and community groups that support and influence children's growth and development. Fifteen permanent exhibits and programming spaces provide innovative learning experiences for children and their caregivers. The museum serves more than 500,000 visitors annually. CCM also reaches out beyond its walls by making a significant investment of resources in neighborhoods across Chicago, particularly to children who might not otherwise have access to the museum's rich array of resources.
