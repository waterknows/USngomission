The Independent Institute transcends the all-too-common politicization and superficiality of public policy research and debate, redefines the debate over public issues, and fosters new and effective directions for government reform. In order to fully understand the nature of public issues and possible solutions, the Institute's program adheres to the highest standards of independent scholarly inquiry. The Institute's program is pursued to rigorous standards without regard to any political or social biases. The resulting studies are published and widely distributed as books, articles in The Independent Review, Policy Reports, Working Papers, and other publications.
