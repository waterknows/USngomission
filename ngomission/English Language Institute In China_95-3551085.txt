Founded in 1981, English Language Institute/China (ELIC) is an educational organization that exists to place passionate people in contact with students across Asia through the medium of teaching English. We accomplish this through recruiting, training and sending men and women from the U.S. and Canada to meet the ever-growing demand for quality English education in Asia. While ELIC is focused primarily on university campuses, we believe that we also have a stake in what happens beyond the campus. We currently have 534 teachers and family members in Asia, and have sent 10,000 throughout the history of our organization.
