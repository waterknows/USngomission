Founded in 1882, the Portland Museum of Art preserves, documents, and interprets four significant architectural landmarks and a rich variety of art drawn from its collections and from loans to encourage its visitors and community to experience original work. The Museum consistently creates outstanding exhibitions, educational programs, and activities that inspire and enrich the lives of diverse audiences; it also serves as a vital cultural center for greater Portland, the state of Maine, and New England. The Museum's extensive collection of fine and decorative arts dates from the 18th century to the present; the Museum also has the largest collection of European art north of Boston and a comprehensive collection of Winslow Homer's graphics.
