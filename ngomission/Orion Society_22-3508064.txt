Since it's first publication in 1982, Orion has become a focal point in an extraordinarily rich period of nature writing, and it has remained true to that core conviction, though the magazine has evolved into a bimonthly and the range of its interests has broadened to include not only environmental but cultural concerns. Orion's mission is to inform, inspire, and engage individuals and grassroots organizations in becoming a significant cultural force for healing nature and community.
