Since 1992, the Organic Farming Research Foundation (OFRF) has worked to foster the improvement and widespread adoption of organic farming systems. They achieve this mission by sponsoring research related to organic farming, disseminating research results to organic farmers and to growers interested in adopting organic production systems, and educating the public and decision-makers about organic farming issues. OFRF's integrated strategy of grantmaking, policy, education and networking initiatives supports organic farmers' immediate information needs while moving the public and policymakers toward greater investment in organic farming systems.
