The Action Center's mission is to provide an immediate response to basic human needs and to promote pathways to self-sufficiency. We do this through our continuum of services to families and individuals of Jefferson County. Since 1968, the Action Center has been providing essential stabilizing services to the people in Jefferson County who are in danger of becoming homeless, or attempting to move out of homelessness. It serves as a haven of hope for the thousands of homeless, near homeless, and working poor who come through our door every year. People can receive assistance with a five-day supply of food, clothing for the whole family, necessary household items, and medical care.
