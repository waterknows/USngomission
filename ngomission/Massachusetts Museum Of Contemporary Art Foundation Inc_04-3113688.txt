MASS MoCA is the largest center for contemporary arts in the United States. Opened in 1999, it is housed on a 13-acre campus of renovated 19th-century factory buildings. The institution is dedicated to the creation and presentation of provocative visual and performing arts pieces, and of works that blur conventional distinctions between artistic disciplines. In addition, MASS MoCA functions as a laboratory for the contemporary arts, fostering experimentation by artists, encouraging collaborations among institutions, and allowing visitors a behind-the-scenes look at the creative process. By coupling the versatility and size of its spaces with the latest technologies, MASS MoCA is able to present and catalyze the creation of works that can be shown nowhere else in the world.
