The Colon Cancer Alliance (CCA) is the oldest and largest national patient advocacy organization dedicated to ending the suffering caused by colorectal cancer. In order to increase rates of screening and survivorship, the CCA provides patient support, public education, supports research and conducts advocacy work across America. The CCA offers information and support from the first-hand experience of survivors and others whose lives have been touched by this disease. Today, the CCA provides information and services to hundreds of thousands each year. We have multiple programs designed to both assist those affected by the disease as well as raise awareness to improve screening rates. The growth and success of the organization is due in large part to caring volunteers who devote considerable time, skill and energy to achieving CCA's vision.
