Weingarten Children's Center (formerly Jean Weingarten Peninsula Oral School for the Deaf and currently legally incorporated as the Foundation for Hearing Research)) is a not-for-profit, state accredited non-public school teaching children with hearing loss to listen, think and talk through intensive speech/language therapy and the development of listening skills. Established in 1967, our program focuses on the development of auditory, language, speech and cognitive skills in children with hearing aids and cochlear implants.
