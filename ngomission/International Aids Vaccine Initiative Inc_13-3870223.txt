Founded in 1996, the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) is a global, public-private partnership working to accelerate the development of a vaccine to prevent HIV infection and AIDS. IAVI researches and develops vaccine candidates, conducts policy analyses, and serves as an advocate for the field with offices in Africa, India, and Europe. IAVI supports a comprehensive approach to HIV and AIDS that balances the expansion and strengthening of existing HIV prevention and treatment programs with targeted investments in new AIDS prevention technologies. We also work to ensure a future vaccine will be accessible to all who need it.
