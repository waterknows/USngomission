Founded in 1989, Target Hunger works to alleviate hunger and its root causes in the heart of Houston's inner city. Target Hunger is one of Houston's largest organizations that distributes food to families. We assist individuals in inner-city neighborhoods who are food insecure. Our agency focuses on rebuilding and strengthening family units by empowering our clients to become self-sufficient through our programs. More than three million pounds of food are distributed each year and more than 9,600 individuals are served each month.
