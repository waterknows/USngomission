Founded in 1978, the Center for Neighborhood Technology (CNT) has been a leader in promoting more livable and sustainable urban communities. As a creative think-and-do-tank, we research, invent, and test urban strategies that use resources more efficiently and more equitably. Over the years, CNT's work, especially in the areas of climate, energy, natural resources, transportation and community development, has paid off by fueling a generation of community development and learning institutions, earning CNT a reputation as an economic innovator and leader in the field of creative sustainable development. CNT launched two non-profits that advance our mission: CNT Energy develops and implements initiatives to help consumers and communities control energy costs and reduce energy use; and I-Go, a membership-based car sharing organization.
