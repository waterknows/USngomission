The Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Museum works to preserve the physical legacy and experience of American railroading; interpret and present its history to the widest possible audience; and develop programs which broaden and deepen public appreciation of the past, present and future significance of the railroad industry in the development of American life. Opened in 1953 as the Baltimore & Ohio Transportation Museum, the Museum is home to the oldest, most comprehensive American railroad collection in the world. The Museum's 40-acre historic site, its unrivalled collections and magnificent buildings combined with innovative education and public programming have earned it the sobriquet America's railroad museum.
