Rancho Cielo is a comprehensive learning and social services center for underserved youth in Monterey County. Residing on 100 acres and encompassing two lakes, stables and a cultivated garden, Rancho Cielo is also a restored piece of Salinas Valley natural history. Our mission is to partner with our community to provide a safe campus to deliver programs and services that inspire at risk youth to learn new skills, gain self-esteem and confidence. Our vision is to transform the lives of at-risk youth and empower them to become accountable, competent, productive and responsible citizens.
