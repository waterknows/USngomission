According to the World Health Organization, there are at least 59 million people in the world who need a wheelchair but don't have one. Founded in 1996, UCP Wheels for Humanity (UCP Wheels) provides appropriately fitted wheelchairs and quality of life services to children and adults with physical disabilities in developing countries. The organization also serves as an advocate and capacity-building partner to local organizations, so we can build sustainable, community-based systems that create long-term change. Over the course of its 17-year history UCP Wheels has worked in over 70 countries and touched the lives of more than 313,300 people. UCP Wheels also benefits from the efforts of more than 300 volunteers annually, and in addition to monetary contributions, gratefully accepts used wheelchairs and other mobility equipment.
