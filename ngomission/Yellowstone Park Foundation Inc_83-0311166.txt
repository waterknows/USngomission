The Yellowstone Park Foundation is a 501(c)3, non-profit organization created in 1996. A group of concerned citizens, working with the National Park Service, started the Foundation in order to protect, preserve, and enhance Yellowstone National Park.



The Foundation works to fund important projects and programs, many of which are beyond the financial capacity of the National Park Service. The Foundation receives no annual government funding; it relies instead upon the generous support of private citizens, foundations, and corporations to ensure that Yellowstone's great gifts to the world will never diminish.



Since its inception, the Yellowstone Park Foundation has contributed more than $40 million to Yellowstone National Park, and has successfully funded more than 200 Park projects. Including $15 million for the new Old Faithful Visitor Education Center.
