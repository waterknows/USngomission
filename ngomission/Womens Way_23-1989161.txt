Women's Way was formed in the mid-1970Â´s by a group of women running women-focused agencies that were struggling to keep their doors open. The causes they served - wage equity, rape crisis, domestic violence, reproductive freedom - were controversial and hard to fund. They joined together to raise a collective voice and to generate funding for issues impacting women. Women's Way has put over 20 million dollars to work to enhance the lives of women and families and to provide vital support and assistance to the agencies that serve them. Each year, Women's Way allocates critical operating funds to six member agencies, and also provides grants to a dynamic group of agencies through its Community Women's Fund.
