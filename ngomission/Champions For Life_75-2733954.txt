Bill Glass BEHIND THE WALLS was founded in 1969 with one mission: to assist the Church by equipping and igniting Christians to share their faith in Jesus Christ with the "least of these." Each year thousands of volunteers join our prison ministry to lead tens of thousands of inmates to life-changing decisions for Jesus. In the first 40 years more than 1,000,000 of these decisions were recorded. For a great number of the volunteers our event was the first experience in sharing the Gospel with others, and has since emboldened them to step out of the "comfort zone" to be more active in sharing their faith. By learning to share faith in prison you are tapped into a unique training opportunity with eternal significance with a proven impact on society.
