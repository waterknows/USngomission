The Institute for Energy Research (IER) conducts intensive research and analysis on the functions, operations, and government regulation of global energy markets. IER maintains that freely-functioning energy markets provide the most efficient and effective solutions to today's global energy and environmental challenges and, as such, are critical to the well-being of individuals and society. IER's perspective is based on the following tenets: free markets; objective science; public policy tradeoffs; efficient outcomes; and impartiality.
