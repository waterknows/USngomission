Founded in 1893 by social work pioneer Lillian Wald and based on Manhattan's Lower East Side, the Henry Street Settlement delivers a wide range of social service and arts programming to more than 100,000 New Yorkers each year. Distinguished by a profound connection to its neighbors, a willingness to address new problems with swift and innovative solutions, and a strong record of accomplishment, Henry Street challenges the effects of urban poverty by helping families achieve better lives for themselves and their children. Henry Street's core divisions include a multidisciplinary arts center, shelter and supportive services, behavioral and health services, senior services, home care services, a workforce development center, day care centers, and after school and summer programs for neighborhood youth.
