Founded in 2006, Colon Cancer Coalition empowers you to Get Your Rear in Gear by bringing understanding, raising awareness, and eliminating fear of colon cancer. Our grassroots campaign to drive early intervention and detection of colon cancer on a national level is collaborative at heart; we know change comes as we partner with others to connect people to resources that help them live strong and healthy lives. Because colon cancer is so treatable, we encourage people not to run from screening with Get Your Rear in Gear 5K Run/Walk events in communities across America.
