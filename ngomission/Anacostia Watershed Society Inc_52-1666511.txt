The mission of the Anacostia Watershed Society is to restore and protect the Anacostia River and its watershed communities by cleaning the water, recovering the shores, and honoring the heritage. Our ultimate vision, in keeping with the Clean Water Act, is to return the Anacostia to a fishable and swimmable river. The Anacostia Watershed Society was founded in 1989 by a small group of concerned individuals who decided that the environmental needs of the Anacostia River and its watershed communities required serious attention. Over the past 25 years, our staff and programming efforts have expanded significantly to encompass efforts in environmental education, stewardship, and recreation, as well as engaging the community through public affairs.
