Our mission is to change the world for hurting and forgotten children by giving them hope in the love of Jesus Christ.We do this by taking humanitarian and spiritual aid into the hard places where war, natural disasters and disease epidemics have devastated societies. These children in hard places know horrors most of our children have never even heard of. Food, shelter, medicine and education are not enough to heal their emotions. Many have been sexually abused or beaten. They need hope. Hope's name is Jesus! Our work currently focuses heavily on Swaziland, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and South Africa, and efforts are also underway in Vietnam and the Philippines.
