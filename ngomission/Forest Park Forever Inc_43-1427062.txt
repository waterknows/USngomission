Forest Park Forever (FPF) was founded in 1986 to work in partnership with the City of St. Louis and the Department of Parks, Recreation and Forestry to make Forest Park a premier urban park. Our mission is to increase public understanding, appreciation, and stewardship of the Park. More than 12 million visitors a year use Forest Park. Within Park boundaries there is a primary forest, a secondary successional forest, and several fragile ecosystems. There are approximately 18,000 trees in Forest Park. Over the past decade, more than $94 million has been invested in the restoration of this community treasure.
