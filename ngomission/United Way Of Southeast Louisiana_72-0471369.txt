United Way of Southeast Louisiana's mission is to increase the organized capacity of people to be independent and self-sufficient. Our vision is to position the United Way system in an effort to strengthen the

community's ability to impact its own problems. United Way's primary focus is on long term hurricane recovery. We are still providing a coordinated response to Katrina and Rita and more recently, Gustav and Ike, so we can have a healthy quality of life, a strong workforce and brighter economic future for our six-parish area. We are currently working to build strong families that can provide supports necessary to assure that their children are successful, a safety net for our frail or disadvantaged populations, and the ability to maximize health and independence for all people.
