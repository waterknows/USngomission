The United Way of Mid Coast Maine works to improve lives by mobilizing the caring power of communities. We help connect people to services in our community through 2-1-1 Maine and connect people to volunteer opportunities throughout our region. We also work in creative ways to improve local people's education, financial stability, and health. Council members also work with others in our local communities to address root causes and prevent problems before they start.
