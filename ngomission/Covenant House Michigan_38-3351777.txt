Covenant House Michigan (CHM) is a faith-based organization that provides hope to homeless, runaway and at-risk youth ages 13-22. We provide shelter, educational and vocational programs, as well as other support services, to help overcome hurdles such as homelessness, unemployment, inadequate education, violence, drugs and gangs. Our goal is to redirect them onto a path toward meaningful and successful adulthood. CHM has come to be known by Detroit area young people as a place they can go to build a better future and be treated with respect and unconditional love. Over 35,069 youth have been served by CHM since its inception in September, 1997.
