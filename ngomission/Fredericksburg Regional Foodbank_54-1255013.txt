The Fredericksburg Area Food Bank was incorporated in 1982 as the Fredericksburg Area Food Relief Clearinghouse. In the spring of 1995, the organization changed its name to the Fredericksburg Area Food Bank and became a certified affiliate member of Feeding America. Our warehouse contains 8,000 cubic feet of freezer and cooler space. We distribute more than 2.5 million pounds food and grocery products every year to more than 90 food pantries and other food assistance organizations.
