Diabetic Youth Foundation (DYF) improves the quality of life for children, teens and families affected by diabetes. The Foundation provides education and recreation within a supportive community, encouraging personal growth, knowledge and independence. DYF was founded in 1938 by Dr. Mary B. Olney, a physician from UC San Francisco. Dr. Olney believed that children with type-1 diabetes could live healthy and productive lives by learning how to care for their diabetes with a complex management system. Today, DYF still holds true to that philosophy, creating opportunities for children, teens and families with diabetes which are equal to that of their peers who do not have diabetes.
