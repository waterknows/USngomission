The Jewish Federation of Pinellas County is the thread that runs through the fabric of our Jewish community, its organizations, and services, connecting us all. Our mission is to grow and strengthen the Jewish community locally, in Israel, and throughout the world. We support programs for Jewish people in need world wide, providing food for the hungry and counseling for the troubled, spearheading rescue and relief efforts for isolated Jews in distressed regions and funding innovative Jewish educational and unity initiatives. We create a sense of community for more than 25,000 Jewish residents throughout Pinellas and Pasco Counties by creating and supporting programs to further Jewish learning, identity, pride and culture.
