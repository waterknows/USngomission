The National Committee on United States-China Relations promotes understanding and cooperation between the United States and Greater China in the belief that sound and productive Sino-American relations serve vital American and world interests. Established in 1966, the Committee focuses its exchange, educational, and policy programs on international relations, economic development and management, governance and legal affairs, environmental and other global concerns, mass communication, and education administration - addressing these issues with respect to the People's Republic, Hong Kong SAR and Taiwan. The Committee's programs draw strength from its members, who now number more than 750 Americans from all parts of the country and nearly 100 corporations and professional firms.
