It's not about the beansâ€¦Women's Bean Project is a social enterprise generating a new kind of profit: a sustainable solution to chronic unemployment and poverty. Each program participant works in a transitional job in manufacturing to receive immediate income and support services to overcome barriers to employment. She also learns the job readiness, interpersonal and life skills needed to get and keep a job. By helping a woman thrive, the Bean Project makes a positive impact, not only on her life and her family's future, but also on our community and economy.Our approach benefits more than the individual women we serve, it benefits us all. When a woman thrives, we all gain.
