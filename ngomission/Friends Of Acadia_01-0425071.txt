Founded in 1986, Acadia National Park on Mt. Desert Island, Maine, is one of Earth's most magnificent places. Its spectacular scenery and abundant recreational opportunities draw more than two million visitors each year, making it one of America's top ten most popular national parks. At 45,000 acres, it is also one of the smallest and most vulnerable. This is why Friends of Acadia exists. As an independent organization, we add a margin of excellence to park and island protection beyond what the government can do by: making crucial conservation grants to the park and communities; recruiting and leading a corps of dedicated volunteers; defending the area against threats and advocating for Acadia before Congress and the Maine legislature.
