The Ballet, Opera and Philharmonic creates art that celebrates life in our community. The merger of these three great art forms into one efficient operation has brought about great synergy and the potential of powerful collaboration. Dayton Opera's signature characteristics of great singing, great stories, and visual spectacle certainly apply in the season lineup. The Dayton Philharmonic has provided an introduction to the wonders of classical music through its manÂ­y Education Programs. The Dayton Ballet School provides the very finest dance training to any child or adult who seeks to experience the wonders and the fun of dance.
