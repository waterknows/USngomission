Since 1966, the efforts of the National Rowing Foundation (NRF) have been directed toward promoting the United States' participation in international rowing competition. The first donations made by the National Rowing Foundation supported twenty-nine competitors that entered the World Rowing Championships in Bled, Yugoslavia in 1966. Today, the National Rowing Foundation has expanded to support the US National Team of women, men, lightweights and juniors. Every gift to the National Rowing Foundation, gives our dedicated men and women representing the US at the highest level the experience, equipment, and travel necessities they need to pursue their dreams.
