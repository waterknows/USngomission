Founded in 1946, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society funds more research, offers more services for people with MS, and provides more professional education programs than any other MS organization in the world. Through its home office in New York and its 50-state network of chapters, the Society serves more than one million people annually. At the Society's Northern California Chapter, our emphasis is wellness. Since 1954, the Chapter has been committed to the empowerment of people with MS, their families, friends, significant others, and all people affected by MS. We are committed to honoring and supporting the independence and self-sufficiency of people with MS by providing accurate and timely information, advocacy, material assistance, and emotional support.
