Union Station Homeless Services is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization whose mission is to help homeless men, women and children rebuild their lives.We are part of a premier group of agencies in Los Angeles County that are leading the way to end homelessness. We are the San Gabriel Valley's largest social service agency assisting homeless and very low-income adults and families. Since 1973, Union Station has helped rebuild the lives of thousands of people who were once homeless and without hope.The vision expressed four decades ago by the community volunteers who founded this agency still rings true today - every person deserves a life of dignity and a safe place to call home.We proudly offer a full continuum of eight programs in seven locations. Our services include intake/assessment, shelter, housing, and employment.
