At the Boys & Girls Clubs of Cleveland, our mission is to inspire and enable young people who need us most to reach their full potential as productive, caring, responsible citizens. We exist so that we can provide children who are most in need a safe place to grow, learn and realize their full potential - because they will become tomorrow's parents, workforce and leaders. With a wide range of programs, we support healthy lifestyles, academic success, character-building and leadership development.
