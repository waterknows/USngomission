Founded in 1998, Shared Hope International (SHI) exists to rescue and restoration of women and children in crisis. We are leaders in a worldwide effort to prevent and eradicate sex trafficking and slavery through education and public awareness. For almost a decade, Shared Hope International has served the world's most destitute. We work diligently across the world, partnering with local groups to help women and children enslaved in the sex trade by providing them with shelter, healthcare, education and vocational training opportunities. Our three-pronged strategy- prevent, rescue and restore- is producing hope. We will not give up. We will continue going into the darkness, rescuing and restoring young women and precious children- one life at a time.
