The National Jewish Outreach Program (NJOP) was founded in 1987, by Rabbi Ephraim Buchwald, to stem the losses of Jews from Jewish life due to assimilation and lack of Jewish knowledge. NJOP has become one of the largest and most successful Jewish outreach organizations in the world. Through attractive and exciting free programs, NJOP reaches out to unaffiliated Jews, offering positive, joyous Jewish experiences and meaningful educational opportunities. NJOP programs are presently offered at more than 3,670 locations across North America, and in 37 countries worldwide. NJOP has successfully reached close to 1,054,000 North American Jews and engaged them in Jewish life.
