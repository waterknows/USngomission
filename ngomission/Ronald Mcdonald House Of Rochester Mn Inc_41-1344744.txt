Founded in 1979, The Ronald McDonald House is a "home away from home" for families who must travel hundreds, sometimes thousands of miles to seek medical treatment for their children. Families who stay at the Ronald McDonald House share their stories and gain new insights as they meet children and parents with similar concerns. The Ronald McDonald House is a 24 guestroom home, complete with living areas, kitchen, laundry, playrooms and a game room for children to enjoy.
