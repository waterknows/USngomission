The Marine Mammal Center recognizes human interdependence with marine mammals and their importance as sentinels of the ocean environment, the health of which is essential for all life. It is our responsibility to use our awareness, compassion and intelligence to foster marine mammal survival and the conservation of their habitat. Since 1975, over 18,000 animals, such as elephant seals, sea lions, sea otters, harbor seals, fur seals, dolphins, harbor porpoises and the like, have been rescued and treated at our hospital facility. Each year marine science education programs and events reach over 100,000 school children and members of the general public, helping to foster a sense of responsibility and connection to the marine environment.
