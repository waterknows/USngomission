Founded in 1979, Domestic Abuse Project (DAP) dedicates its resources to breaking the cycle of violence and helping families transform from crisis to healthy and safe relationships. We seek to permanently break the cycle of family violence by leading societal change and by providing men, women, and children with essential tools needed to eliminate violence in their lives. We offer group and individual counseling for every member of a family: men, women, and children. Additionally, our advocates provide a range of advocacy services to survivors of domestic abuse. We can help you find safe shelter, obtain an Order for Protection, change your locks, and more. Court advocates help victims to navigate the complicated court system, so that their voices are heard.
