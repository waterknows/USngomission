Established in 1923, Belmont Hill School is an independent boys' day and boarding school that provides a rigorous learning environment for 400+ boys in grades 7-12. Small classes, averaging 12-13 students, and a full schedule from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. combine classical yet innovative education with extensive opportunities in athletics, music, theater, visual arts, community service, and other activities. The faculty hold students to high standards, develop character and instill values in their students, and concern themselves with each student's total development, socially, personally, and academically. Belmont Hill School strives to have its students leave with a love of learning and a willingness to work hard, take risks, take a stand, and make a difference.
