PADS Lake County is dedicated to providing emergency shelter, permanent supportive housing, and comprehensive resources to families with children and individuals experiencing homelessness in Lake County, Illinois. Founded in 1972 as a 24-hour telephone crisis hotline, PADS' (Providing Advocacy, Dignity and Shelter) mission has evolved as the needs of Lake County Illinois' most vulnerable have grown over the organization's thirty-five year history. Today, as the only 24/7 emergency shelter system in Lake County, PADS operates fourteen emergency shelter sites, one fixed site (The Family Center), veteran's housing, and provides numerous supportive services. We assist individuals, families with children, the mentally ill, and veterans regardless of their reason for being homeless.
