Harvest International is a non-denominational Christian-based ministry whose purpose is to make a difference in the physical and spiritual lives of people throughout the world, one person at a time. We are a facilitating ministry helping those who have a genuine call on their lives to serve the Lord in a foreign mission field on a long term basis (3 years or longer). We provide administrative, logistical and prayer support to encourage and enable their work. We presently have representation in Cuba, Haiti, India, Jamaica, Kenya, Romania, Uganda, Ukraine, US Virgin Islands and Zimbabwe. We provide Child Sponsorship Programs where individuals, families, or Churches, can support a child on a monthly basis. We provide opportunities for individuals, groups, and Churches to serve the Lord on short-term (7-14 days) mission trips holding Medical clinics, doing Building projects, Vacation Bible School, Door-to-Door Evangelism, Feeding programs, and wedding ministries.
