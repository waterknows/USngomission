Hope For Haiti's Children (HFHC) is a faith-based organization founded in 1995 in order to demonstrate Christian compassion to poverty-bound Haitian children and their families, providing opportunities for these children to become leaders in their homes, churches, and communities. Today, there are over 1,300 children sponsored in ten different schools associated with churches of Christ in central and southern Haiti. Currently Hope for Haiti's Children average 100 new students per year to the Child Education Sponsorship program. HFHC follows a sustainable approach in this work, having established an in-country network of trusted local Christian educators, business leaders, and other professionals who carry out the day-to-day operations.
