The Center for Ecoliteracy is dedicated to education for sustainable living. We provide information, inspiration, and support to the vital movement of K-12 educators, parents, and other members of the school community who are helping young people gain the knowledge, skills, and values essential to sustainable living. We base our work on these four guiding principles: nature is our teacher, sustainability is a community practice, the real world is the optimal learning environment, and sustainable living is rooted in a deep knowledge of place. Through our initiative, Smart by Nature: Schooling for Sustainability, we offer both a strong theoretical framework and practical resources for combining hands-on learning in the natural world with curricular innovation in K-12 education.
