Founded in 1962, Wings of Hope delivers humanitarian programs to the impoverished to achieve a more peaceful world. Using primarily aviation-based tools, we currently work in 13 countries around the globe helping the world's poorest citizens access the basic resources essential to human dignity. Instead of simply providing charity, we work side by side with communities around the world as they work towards self-sufficiency. Our programs include:-	Access to health services -	Sustainable food and water systems -	Educational infrastructure and programs-	Economic opportunity-	Community developmentWe respond to requests all over the globe--in the USA, Asia, Africa, Central and South America--to build customized and holistic solutions helping communities ensure long-term sustainability. Wings of Hope was nominated twice for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2011 and 2012 in recognition of this important work.
