Legal Aid of Western Missouri (LAWMo) has been providing essential legal services to low-income citizens since 1964. LAWMo staff attorneys, paralegals and volunteers assist over 20,000 people each year with problems that seriously affect their ability to provide for themselves and their families. Priority is given to cases involving housing, employment, domestic abuse, immigration, consumer problems and public benefits. LAWMo clients are people who have nowhere else to turn, who without the legal assistance LAWMo can provide, would likely become homeless statistics or worse. LAWMo works to ensure there is equal access to justice for those without the ability to pay.
