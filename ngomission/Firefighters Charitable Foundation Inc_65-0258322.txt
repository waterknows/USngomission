The Firefighters Charitable Foundation's (FFCF) primary focus is to provide much needed financial assistance to individuals who have been affected by a fire or disaster, to support other disaster or prevention related charities and institutions, and volunteer fire departments. FFCF also has a nationwide volunteer brigade that acts as our eyes and ears to identify those in critical need. Since our founding in 1991, our funding assists fire and disaster victims; and supports volunteer fire departments; supports outreach programs for fire safety, first aid education and aids children in need; and delivers grants to other charitable organizations that help victims of fire.
