Founded in 1954, the Boys and Girls Club of Benton Harbor's mission is to inspire and enable all young people, especially those who need us the most, to realize their full potential as productive, responsible and caring citizens. Everyday, the Boys and Girls Club of Benton Harbor strive to improve each child's life by implementing self-esteem, courage, and positive values through all of the educational programs. Our youth come to the Boys and Girls Club to receive tutoring, computer training, sports education, homework help, and mentoring. Our youth gain confidence by developing a sense of usefulness and belonging.
