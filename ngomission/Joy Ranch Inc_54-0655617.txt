Joy Ranch provides a welcoming, safe, caring, and Christ-centered environment to meet the spiritual, physical, emotional, and social needs of children and their families in crisis. Joy Ranch, with 5 cottages on 60 acres, has helped provide a caring home for over 5,000 children, and is still funded by contributions as small as $1 from individuals, to much larger donations from supporting churches and organizations. Richard and Mary McHenry lovingly and faithfully directed Joy Ranch until their retirement in 1978.
