The mission of Catalina Council is to prepare young people to make ethical choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Law. We offer programs and activities that instill values and teach life skills to an ever increasing number of youth by coordinating community resources to build tomorrow's leaders today.
