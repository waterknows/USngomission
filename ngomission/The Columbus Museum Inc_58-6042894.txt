Founded in 1953, the Columbus Museum is one of the largest museums in the Southeast and is unique for its dual concentration on American art and regional history, displayed in both its permanent collection as well as temporary exhibitions. As an integral part of, and partner with, the Muscogee County School District since its inception, the Museum enriches its community and serves its schoolchildren through a full calendar of educational programs as well. The Museum's doors are always open with free admission to the public. These efforts combine in the Museum's mission statement to collect, preserve, research and interpret American art and regional culture for the education, enrichment and enjoyment of a broad and diverse public.
