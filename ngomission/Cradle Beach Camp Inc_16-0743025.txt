Cradle Beach serves the needs of children with disabilities and those who come from disadvantaged backgrounds. We provide a healthy environment and organized activities to promote socialization, self-worth, and decision making, in an atmosphere of love and acceptance. Cradle Beach serves approximately 800 children with special needs and those who come from disadvantaged backgrounds between the ages of 8 and 16 in our summer camping program.
