For 145 years the YMCA of Central Massachusetts, formerly the YMCA of Greater Worcester, has been building strong kids, strong families and strong communities. Originally chartered to improve the spiritual and mental condition of young men, the YMCA has evolved, but the basic mission, rooted in Judeo-Christian principles, has remained. From its first permanent home in downtown Worcester, constructed in 1886, the organization has grown and now serves more than 30,000 men, women, boys and girls annually throughout its 40 town service area. Committed to affecting positive change, the YMCA has been recognized for its efforts in the areas of character development, teen programs, homelessness, neighborhood revitalization, international partnerships and summer camps.
