Oral Health America was founded in 1955 as the American Fund for Dental Health by members of the American Dental Association, American Dental Education Association, the American Dental Trade Association, and the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company to raise funds for the improvement of dental education. In 1994, Oral Health America broke away from its founding institutions to follow a path of broad-based public advocacy through targeted programs and communications efforts to improve oral health for all Americans. We develop, implement and facilitate educational and service programs designed to raise awareness of oral health's importance to total health.
