Established in 1985, Samaritan Inns provides structured housing and recovery services in an environment of support and accountability that will give homeless and addicted men and women the opportunity to rebuild their lives. Samaritan Inns' Recovery Continuum Program has proven results in its unique holistic approach to recovery treatment. Samaritan Inns' Intensive Recovery Program is a component of our Recovery Continuum Program serving men and women ages 18 to 60 years desiring freedom from a life of homelessness and addictions. Single Residency Occupancy (SRO) is the final element of the Recovery Continuum Program. SRO is designed to assist residents with applying acquired tools to live a wholesome, alcohol/drug free life on their recovery road.
