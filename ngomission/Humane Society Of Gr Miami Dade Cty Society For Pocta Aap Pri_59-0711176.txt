The Humane Society of Greater Miami is a limited admit, adoption guarantee facility dedicated to placing every dog and cat in our care into a loving home, and to promoting responsible pet ownership and spay/neuter programs. Adoption guarantee means that every animal that is admitted to our shelter is free from the threat of euthanasia for time, space, or treatable medical issues. We provide shelter, food, veterinary care, and plenty of TLC while the dogs and cats wait for their permanent home, no matter how long it takes.We have been helping homeless animals in Miami-Dade County since 1936. We offer programs and services to educate, inform, and inspire people to take responsible care of their pets and treat animals with the kindness they deserve. With the support of people from across the county, we are helping to create a better community for all. We are a private, not-for-profit, 501 (c) (3) charitable animal welfare organization.
