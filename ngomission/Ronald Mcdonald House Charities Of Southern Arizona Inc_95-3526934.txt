Ronald McDonald House Charities of Southern Arizona exists to provide a home-away-from-home for families who have traveled to Tucson seeking medical treatment for their children. More than just a place to sleep, Ronald McDonald House provides a warm, safe, and comfortable home-like environment for families who are caring for seriously ill children. The Tucson Ronald McDonald House opened on February 14, 1981. Ronald McDonald Family Room at Diamond Children's Medical Center extends our care and comfort to families both near and far by creating a little piece of Ronald McDonald House right inside the hospital. While we cannot ease the pain these families experience, we can help lessen their burden.
