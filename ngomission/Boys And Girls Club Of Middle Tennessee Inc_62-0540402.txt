The Boys & Girls Clubs of Middle Tennessee enables all young people, especially those who need us most, to reach their full potential as productive, caring, and responsible citizens. We accomplish our mission through three vehicles of service: after school programming; summer enrichment; and sport leagues. Through these vehicles we offer our Club members hope and opportunity; ongoing relationships with caring adult professionals; life-enriching programs with character development experiences; and a safe place to learn and grow.
