Founded in 1886, Thompson Child & Family Focus (formerly Thompson Children's Home) provides diverse services in treatment, education and care. Thompson embraces children who are at risk for social and academic failure by providing intensive treatment, protection, specialized education and stabilized family environments. We believe these are the core ingredients that ensure success. The ability of our children and families to achieve independent and rewarding lives is the challenge that connects all of our efforts.
