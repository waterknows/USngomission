The Violence Policy Center (VPC) is a national educational foundation that conducts research on violence in America and works to develop violence-reduction policies and proposals. The Center examines the role of firearms in America, conducts research on firearms violence, and explores new ways to decrease firearm-related death and injury. The VPC approaches gun violence as a public health issue, advocating that firearms be subject to health and safety standards like those that apply to all other consumer products. As the most aggressive group in the gun control movement, the VPC has a record of policy successes on the federal, state, and local levels. Each year, the VPC releases hard-hitting, fact-based studies on a full range of gun violence issues.
