The Masorti Foundation for Conservative Judaism in Israel supports the work of the Masorti Movement, raising funds to enable the Movement to further its activities in Israel. The Foundation also serves as the Movement's voice to American media, public officials and Jewish leadership. The Masorti Movement, founded in 1979, is the umbrella organization of Masorti kehillot (congregations), which foster the practice of traditional Judaism among Israeli men and women while embracing modernity. In promoting the combined values of Conservative Judaism, religious tolerance and Zionism, the Movement strives to nurture a healthy, pluralistic, spiritual and ethical foundation for Israeli society.
