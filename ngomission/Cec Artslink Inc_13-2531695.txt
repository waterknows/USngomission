Founded in 1962, CEC ArtsLink is an international arts organization. Our programs encourage and support exchange of artists and cultural managers between the United States and Eastern and Central Europe, Russia, Central Asia and the Caucasus. We believe that the arts are a society's most deliberate and complex means of communication, and that artists and arts administrators can help nations overcome long histories of reciprocal distrust, insularity and conflict. With solid expertise and lasting partnerships in 30 countries, CEC ArtsLink promotes communication and understanding through collaborative, innovative projects for mutual benefit.
