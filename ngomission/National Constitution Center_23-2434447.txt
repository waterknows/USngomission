The National Constitution Center (NCC) was created by the Constitution Heritage Act in 1988. An independent, nonpartisan organization, NCC is dedicated to increasing public understanding of, and appreciation for, the Constitution, its history, and its contemporary relevance so that we the people may better secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity. This is achieved through an interactive, interpretive facility within Independence National Historical Park and a program of national outreach. The NCC is both a museum that attracted one million visitors in its first 15 months of operation and an engine of civic and constitutional education for children and adults.
