Founded in 1969, the Aspen Center for Environmental Studies (ACES) works to inspire a life-long commitment to the earth by educating for environmental responsibility, conserving and restoring the balance of natural communities, and advancing the ethic that the earth must be respected and nurtured. ACES educators conduct approximately 180 field study programs, making some 20,000 contacts with students every school year. ACES is known for its Naturalist Field School that brings professors from all over the country each summer to teach nearly four dozen field courses and workshops. ACES also conducts an intensive naturalist internship program that employs and trains more than 20 young naturalists each year.
