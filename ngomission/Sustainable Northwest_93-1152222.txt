Established in 1994, Sustainable Northwest brings people, ideas, and innovation together so that nature, local economies, and rural communities can thrive. We envision a Northwest where rural communities thrive in harmony with the landscape, resilient local economies provide quality natural resource management jobs that benefit human and natural communities, and the next generation of leaders views land stewardship as an integral component of community health. At the local level, we help build strong rural communities that conserve and restore forests and rangelands. Across communities, we build networks that advance and create a strong collective voice. At the Federal and State policy level, we present solutions that strengthen investment in sustainable natural resource management.
