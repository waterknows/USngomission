The Tom Coughlin Jay Fund Foundation was created in honor of Jay McGillis. Jay was a very special young man who developed leukemia. The courage, compassion and faith he demonstrated during the course of his illness were an inspiration to many people. The mission of the Tom Coughlin Jay Fund Foundation is to assist children with leukemia and other cancers and their families by providing emotional and financial support to help reduce the stress associated with treatment and improve their quality of life.
