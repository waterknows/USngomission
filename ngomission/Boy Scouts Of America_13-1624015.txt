The mission of the Boy Scouts of America, Greater New York Councils is to serve society by helping to instill values in young people and, in other ways to prepare them to make ethical choices during their lifetime and to achieve their full potential. We work towards our vision to be recognized in the five boroughs of New York City and throughout the Scouting organization as the premier agency meeting the needs of urban youth.
