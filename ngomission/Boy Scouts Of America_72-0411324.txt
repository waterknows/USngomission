It is the mission of the Istrouma Area Council, Boys Scouts of America, to build character, citizenship and total fitness while preparing young people to make ethical and moral choices over the course of their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Law. For over a century, the BSA has helped build the future leaders of this country by combining educational activities and lifelong values with fun. The Boy Scouts of America believes - and, through over a century of experience, knows - that helping youth is a key to building a more conscientious, responsible, and productive society. The Istrouma Area Council, (IAC) serves 13 parishes in Louisiana and Wilkinson County, Mississippi and provides a quality Scouting program to more than 8,200 co-ed youth.
