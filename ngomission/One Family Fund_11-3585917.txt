OneFamily provides direct financial, legal, and emotional assistance to victims of terrorism in Israel. Many organizations collect money for victims of terror. OneFamily is different. We collect not only money, but all human resources - bringing together people who have suffered through terror attacks, along with caring people who thankfully haven't. We connect people in Israel with people in almost every country around the world. Together we volunteer time and money in order to help families of terror victims in every way. OneFamily works directly with the families, every day of the year.
