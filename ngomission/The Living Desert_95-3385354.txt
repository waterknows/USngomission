The Living Desert was established in March 1970 as a 360 acre wilderness preserve. Today it is one of the most unique institutions in the country and stands out as the only American zoo and garden dedicated solely to interpreting and conserving the deserts of the world and is the only zoological and botanical park specializing in just one entire ecosystem. The Living Desert has set aside 1,000 acres of natural desert habitat. We foster, through interpretive exhibits, programs and publication, an awareness of and an appreciation for, the variety of plants and animals in worldwide desert ecosystems.
