The Generosity Trust is dedicated to empowering Christian giving. We do this by concentrating our efforts in three areas: Training churches how to multiply their giving, tuition scholarships to seminary students, and providing tools to re-engage Christians with the joy of generosity. The Generosity Trust offers many of these tools at no or little cost to the donor, so as to maximize the amount of money that can be invested into God's Kingdom.
