In 1978, the U.S. Navy Memorial Foundation undertook a drive to build a memorial in Washington. Dedicated on October 13, 1987, the United States Navy Memorial offers Sea Service men and women ways to reconnect with each other, celebrate their shared experiences and preserve the memories and stories of their service. We also provide a forum to educate the public about the rich maritime heritage of this nation and the importance of keeping the seas of the world free. The Navy Memorial's Education department is responsible for conducting youth education programs, seminars and symposia, creating exhibits in the Naval Heritage Center and providing reference information and photographs to researchers. Today, the Foundation is working to retire remaining construction debt and support educational programs.
