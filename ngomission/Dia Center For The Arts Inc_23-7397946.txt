Established in 1974, Dia Art Foundation is internationally recognized as one of the world's most influential contemporary art institutions. Dia's founders, Heiner Friedrich and Philippa de Menil, wished to extend the boundaries of the traditional museum to respond to the needs of the generation of artists whose work matured and became prominent during the 1960s and 1970s. Ever since, Dia's mission has been to commission, support, and present site-specific long-term installations and single-artists exhibitions to the public.
