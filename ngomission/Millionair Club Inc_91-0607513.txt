Since 1921, the Millionair Club Charity has helped rebuild the lives of thousands of men and women in greater Seattle with support programs that connect people who are unemployed or homeless with job opportunities, employment training, certifications, hot meals, free eyeglasses, housing assistance, shower and laundry services and referrals to community support services.These essential wrap-around services encourage self-reliance in our workers and a sense of dignity. We support our men and women every step of the way to ensure they can become "job ready." 60% of our participants are homeless, 16% are veterans, 59% are people of color, 18% are supporting children and 18% are women.In 2014 the Millionair Club Charity launched a Temporary Staffing Solutions program to connect workers to local businesses on a temp-to-hire basis. The organization acts as a staffing agency while our workers enjoy the benefits of gaining valuable work experience with prominent businesses in the area.
