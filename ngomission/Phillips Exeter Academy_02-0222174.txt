Founded in 1781 by Dr. John Phillips, a graduate of Harvard and resident of Exeter, Phillips Exeter Academy is a co-educational residential school serving 1,000 students in grades 9-12, and post-graduate level. Exeter's academic offerings are unrivalled: over 450 courses in 19 subject areas. The student to teacher ratio, 5:1, lets students explore the world with great support from the adults in the community. An Exeter education prepares students to use the skills learned at school in all life's endeavors. Exeter is a life-changing experience, challenging and fun. It asks a great deal from every student - higher standards, greater expectations, and deeper engagement not only in the world of ideas, but also in the life of the community.
