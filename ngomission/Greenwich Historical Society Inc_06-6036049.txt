The Greenwich Historical Society was founded in 1931 to collect and chronicle this vibrant history and has actively pursued its mission at the Bush-Holley Historic Site since purchasing Bush-Holley House in 1957. The circa 1730 structure began life as a home for prosperous merchants and gained recognition later as a boarding house and gathering place for many prominent American artists and writers. It is a National Historic Landmark, a member of the Historic Artists Homes and Studios, one of 18 museums in Connecticut participating in the Connecticut Art Trail and accredited by the American Association of Museums. The Greenwich Historical Society also boasts an extensive research library and archives that contain over 1,200 linear feet of archival material; it is home to the Vanderbilt Education Center, which accommodates lectures, family programs and hands-on activities; and it includes the 1805 Storehouse Gallery, a former warehouse, store and post office that features rotating exhibitions and a museum store.
