The mission of the American Dance Institute (ADI), founded in 1999, is to advance artistic excellence through education, performance and a strong commitment to the development of new works. ADI provides dance instruction in ballet and other art forms to children and adults, provides arts incubator programs for emerging local and national established artists, and produces dance performances by local and national companies and choreographers.
