The American Bar Association (ABA) Fund for Justice and Education (FJE) was created in 1961, as the Fund for Public Education, to allow the ABA to solicit and accept tax-exempt gifts and grants in support of law-related public service and educational programs of the Association. The mission of the FJE is to improve the legal system through law-related public service and educational programs which promote quality in legal services, equal access to justice, better understanding of the law, and improvements in the justice system. Each year, the FJE supports nearly 200 ABA programs that are dedicated to improving the legal system and ensuring access to justice for all citizens.
