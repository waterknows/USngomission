The Adler Aphasia Center mission is to be a vital resource to anyone whose life or profession is touched by Aphasia. Aphasia is a language disorder that impairs the expression and understanding of spoken language, reading and writing. It occurs most often from a stroke or brain injury. This frustrating condition affects a person's ability to communicate, but does not affect his or her intellect. The Adler Aphasia Center is a social center for people with Aphasia and their family members/caregivers - a place where people can connect with others who have had similar experiences.
