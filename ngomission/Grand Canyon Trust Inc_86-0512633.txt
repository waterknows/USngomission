Founded in 1985, the Grand Canyon Trust protects and restores the Colorado Plateau - its spectacular landscapes, flowing rivers, clean air, diversity of plants and animals, and areas of beauty and solitude. As a regional conservation organization we work for common sense, balanced solutions to significant problems affecting the region's natural resources. Our vision for the Colorado Plateau is: a region still characterized by vast open spaces with restored, healthy natural areas and habitat for all native plants and animals; a sustaining relationship between human communities and the natural environment; and people living and visiting here who are willing and enthusiastic stewards of the region's natural resources and beauty.
