The United Way of Greater Kansas City (UWGKC) was created in July 2007 by the merger of the Bi-County United Way of Cass and Jackson, Heart of America United Way (including Northland United Way Services) and United Way of Johnson County. UWGKC continues to maintain local offices representing Eastern Jackson and Cass Counties, Kansas City, MO, the Northland and Johnson County. The offices work to nurture relationships with local donors, companies and partner agencies while embracing a regional approach to service delivery and problem solving. UWKGC's mission is to improve people's lives by mobilizing the caring power of our community.
