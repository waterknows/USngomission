Since 1977, St. Vincent Meals on Wheels has delivered life-saving meals and warm greetings to homebound and hungry seniors and disabled or seriously ill adults across Los Angeles. From Skid Row to West Hollywood, the Hollywood Hills to South L.A., we deliver to over 2,600 clients a day. We also help clients who are unable to live alone by referring them to medical care and social services. We serve anyone in need who lives within our service area, regardless of age, illness, disability, race, religion or ability to pay. Good nutrition and daily home visits improve the health and dignity of our clients, enabling them to remain independent in their own homes for as long as possible.
