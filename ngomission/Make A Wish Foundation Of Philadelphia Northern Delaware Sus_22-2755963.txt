Make-A-Wish® Philadelphia, Northern Delaware & Susquehanna Valley grants the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions to enrich the human experience with hope, strength, and joy. Children over the age of 2½, and under the age of 18, must be referred to Make-A-Wish and determined to be medically eligible for a wish by their physician. The child's treating physician makes the final determination of whether a child's medical condition qualifies him or her for a wish. All wish expenses are fully covered, including any travel and spending money when appropriate. Our objective is to create a memorable wish experience for both the child and family that is not clouded by financial considerations.
