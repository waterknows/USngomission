The Metropolitan Opera, now in its 126th season, is a vibrant home for the most creative and talented artists, including singers, conductors, composers, orchestra musicians, stage directors, designers, visual artists, choreographers, and dancers from around the world. Founded in 1883, The Met has given the U.S. premieres of some of the most important operas in the repertory. Each season the Met stages more than 200 opera performances in New York. More than 800,000 people attend the performances in the opera house during the season, and millions more experience the Met through new media distribution initiatives and state-of-the-art technology. The Met continues its hugely successful radio broadcast series - now in its 77th year - the longest-running classical music series in American broadcast history.
