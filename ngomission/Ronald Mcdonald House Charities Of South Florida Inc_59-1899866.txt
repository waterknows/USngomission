Established in 1988, Ronald McDonald House Charities (RMHC) of South Florida is dedicated to helping local children live happier, healthier and more productive lives by supporting healthcare and medical research programs, education and the arts, and civic and social programs. The Ronald McDonald House (RMH) is a temporary home-away from home for families to find rest, support and time away from realities of the hospital procedures and routines in any Miami-Dade and Broward County pediatric medical facility. In South Florida, there are two Ronald McDonald Houses: the Miami House, which opened its doors in 1981, and the Fort Lauderdale House, which opened in 2004.
