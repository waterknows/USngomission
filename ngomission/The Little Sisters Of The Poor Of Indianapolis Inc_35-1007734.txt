In the early 1870s, four Little Sisters of the Poor came to Indianapolis and by 1873 the Sisters built their first Home in Indianapolis and placed it under the patronage of St. Augustine. Today, The Little Sisters at St. Augustine's Home provide a loving home for 96 needy elderly, offering a continuum of care through independent living apartments, assisted living, or total nursing care. While most Residents are native Hoosiers, some have come from other states and even other countries. The majority of our Residents at St. Augustine's Home are in their mid- to late-80s. While many are Roman Catholic, men and women of all faiths are welcomed to St. Augustine's Home with open arms. The Little Sisters of the Poor of Indianapolis operate St. Augustine's as a true home, rather than an institution.
