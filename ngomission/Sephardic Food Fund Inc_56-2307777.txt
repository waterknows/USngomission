The Food Fund is a community-supported effort dedicated to discreetly identifying the needy in our midst and providing for their nutritional needs without injuring their dignity and pride. The Food Fund is almost entirely staffed by hand-picked volunteers. The Food Fund pioneered the concept of providing ordinary, bank-issued credit cards to individuals and families in distress. These credit cards allow the beneficiaries to shop at all food stores - supermarkets, groceries, butchers, etc. - up to a prescribed monthly credit limit. The credit limit varies according the number of family members plus any special considerations that are taken into account.
