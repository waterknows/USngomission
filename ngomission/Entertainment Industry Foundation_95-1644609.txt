Created in 1942, the Entertainment Industry Foundation (EIF) was established on the belief that the entertainment industry was in a unique position to truly help others. EIF harnesses the collective power of the entertainment industry and channels its unique assets to raise awareness and funds for critical health, educational and social issues in order to make a positive impact in our community and throughout the nation. Annually, the Entertainment Industry Foundation funds more than 300 charitable organizations within the greater Los Angeles area and throughout the nation.
