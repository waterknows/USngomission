As an expression of our Christian faith, Hartford Area Habitat for Humanity (HAHfH) works with people of diverse faiths and backgrounds to build affordable homes and to provide homeownership opportunities for low income families in the 33 town Capital Planning Region. HAHfH received its Affiliate Charter in April 1989 and serves the 33 towns of the Capitol Region in central Connecticut. Since 1989, HAHfH has completed 153 homes housing over 600 individuals in greater Hartford. We have focused our building efforts in Hartford and several of the surrounding towns. We have built or renovated a mixture of multi-unit condominiums and single family homes.
