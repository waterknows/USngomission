The people of Hawaii are one ohana. The Hawaii Foodbank provides food so that no one in our family goes hungry. We work to gather food and support from our communities. We then distribute food through charitable agencies to those in need. Our mission is from the heart, and we will fulfill our mission with integrity, humanity and aloha. Founded in 1982, The Hawaii Foodbank is the only nonprofit agency in the state of Hawaii that collects, warehouses and distributes mass quantities of both perishable and non-perishable food to 250 member agencies on Oahu and Kauai, as well as food banks on the Big Island and Maui . The Hawaii Foodbank forms a vital link between the food donors and our member agencies by providing services in collecting, sorting, salvaging and distributing food. The Hawaii Foodbank also supports its member agencies through financial and educational assistance.
