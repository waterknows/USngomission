Founded in 1994, Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy's mission is to improve the treatment, quality of life and long-term outlook for all individuals affected by Duchenne muscular dystrophy through research, advocacy, education and compassion. Our objectives include: identifying, supporting and sharing promising Duchenne-related research; making state-of-the-art information about treatment and care options available to all members of the Duchenne community; pursuing strategies that will impact this generation of young men affected by Duchenne as well as future generations; encouraging policymakers to afford the same priority to Duchenne as they would to other disorders of similar incidence and prevalence; and creating a supportive community for people affected by Duchenne.
