Alpha House of Tampa, founded in 1981, serves pregnant women in crisis and their families. We offer both maternity and post-birth transitional housing facilities. We empower pregnant and parenting women in crisis to realize their ability to break the cycles of poverty and abuse and create promising lives. Our mission is accomplished by providing our mothers with safe housing, education and counseling, parenting and life skills training, vocational training and assistance, and spiritual support. We call this 360 degrees of support. We offer hope and encouragement to all who enter our doors.
