In the spirit of Christian ministry, the mission of Open Door Community House is to work in partnership with other area service providers to meet basic needs and to empower low income individuals to realize their full potential as children of God. Open Door Community House offers opportunities for spiritual growth, establishes relationships with individuals and families in need, and works cooperatively with other area service agencies to bring about reconciliation in the lives of people in the community. Throughout its history, Open Door has expanded to meet the increasing needs of the community, which has responded by opening its heart to those in need. Open Door works with children, women and families to embody Christ and empower those who need help and hope.
