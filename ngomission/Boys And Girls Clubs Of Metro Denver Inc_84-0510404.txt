Since 1961, the Boys & Girls Clubs of Metro Denver has been helping kids from tough neighborhoods in the metro Denver area stay out of trouble, stay in school and succeed in life. The mission of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Metro Denver is to inspire and enable young people, especially those from disadvantaged circumstances, to realize their full potential as productive, responsible and caring citizens. Not just after-school hangouts, the Clubs are places where young people come to learn, do homework, develop social skills, express themselves creatively, and participate in sports. The Clubs serve more than 12,000 members in the Denver metro area each year.
