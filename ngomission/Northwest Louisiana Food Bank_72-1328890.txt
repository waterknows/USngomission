The Food Bank of Northwest Louisiana serves as the primary resource for fighting hunger in Northwest Louisiana. We distribute food and other essential items to non-profit organizations who serve the needy in the seven parishes of northwest Louisiana. Food is distributed to low-income seniors, half-way houses, churches, the homeless and to individuals. We distribute 8 million pounds of food to our member non-profit agencies and needy individuals every year. Our vision is to ultimately end hunger in Northwest Louisiana. We also offer programs for children living in poverty. Our Back Pack Program provides children with a backpack of shelf-stable foods to eat on the weekends and during holidays. Our Kids Cafe Program provides a hot meal and nutritional education to hungry children in after-school programs.The Summer Food Service Program provides nutritional breakfast and lunches for hungry children that have no access to free food during the summer months.
