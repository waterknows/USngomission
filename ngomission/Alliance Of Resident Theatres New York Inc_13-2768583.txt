The Alliance of Resident Theatres/New York (A.R.T./New York) is the service and advocacy organization for New York City's not-for-profit theatre community. Founded in 1972, A.R.T./New York assists its nearly 300 member theatres in managing their companies effectively so they may realize their rich artistic visions and serve their diverse audiences well. Over the years, A.R.T./New York has earned a reputation as a leader in providing progressive services to its members - from shared office and rehearsal spaces, to the nation's only revolving loan fund for real estate, to technical assistance programs for emerging theatres - which have made our organization an expert in the needs of the Off and Off Off Broadway community.
