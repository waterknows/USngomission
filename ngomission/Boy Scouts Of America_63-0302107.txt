Boy Scouts of America, Greater Alabama Council strives to provide support to Boy Scouts in Greater Alabama as they participate in the programs and activities of the Boy Scouts of America. The mission of the Boy Scouts is to serve others by helping to instill values in young people and, in other ways, to prepare them to make ethical choices over their lifetime in achieving their full potential. Scouting makes a direct and positive impact on the community by teaching positive values and leadership skills to youth. Chartered by the National Council, our local organization has been assigned responsibility for twenty-two counties in North Alabama. Under our charter we are responsible for making the benefits of the movement available to the youth of the territory served by the council.
