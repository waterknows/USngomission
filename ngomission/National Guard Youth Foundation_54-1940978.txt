The National Guard Youth Foundation (NGYF) addresses the growing dropout crisis and its impact on our nation's youth, economy and national security. The cornerstone of our efforts is to raise funds that go toward the expansion of the National Guard Youth ChalleNGe Program, which draws on the structure of the military to give organizational skills and direction, as well as guidance and mentorship to help raise self-esteem and instill a sense of integrity and character in youth who might otherwise be forgotten and left behind. NGYF works to raise awareness through local and national events, panel briefs and PSAs, the Foundation is striving to make the public aware of the dropout problem and what ChalleNGe is doing to combat the issue.
