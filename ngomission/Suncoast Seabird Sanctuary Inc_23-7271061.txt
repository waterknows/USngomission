Founded in 1971 by zoologist Ralph Heath, the Suncoast Seabird Sanctuary is the largest non-profit wild bird hospital in the United States. It is staffed by experienced professionals assisted by over a hundred dedicated volunteers. Similar to a human hospital, it is equipped with emergency facilities, a surgical center, and rehabilitation areas. An average of 23-30 wild birds are admitted every day. There are a variety of species that are permanent residents at the Sanctuary, ranging from tiny song and garden birds to the majestic birds of prey. Although the goal is always to release the birds after they have recuperated from an illness or injury, those who have sustained injuries that prevent them from surviving in the wild are kept permanently at the Sanctuary or given to another reputable facility.
