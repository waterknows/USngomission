More than a fundraising organization, the United Way of Thurston County are partners in change, working with a broad range of individuals and organizations to identify and find solutions to our community's most critical issues. We focus our resources on education, income and health to get at the underlying causes of problems. We work to advance the common good, to improve the lives of those who need help most.
