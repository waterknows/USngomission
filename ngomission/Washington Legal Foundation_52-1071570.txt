Established in 1977, the Washington Legal Foundation (WLF) shapes public policy and fights activist lawyers, regulators, and intrusive government agencies at the federal and state levels, in the courts and regulatory agencies across the country. WLF has one goal: to defend and promote the principles of freedom and justice. WLF is a unique institution with three essential cornerstone programs: shaping public policy through aggressive litigation and advocacy; publishing timely legal studies; and educating policy-makers and the public through extensive communications outreach. The Foundation has developed into the nation's preeminent center for public interest law, advocating free-enterprise principles, responsible government, property rights, a strong national security and defense, and a balanced civil and criminal justice system.
