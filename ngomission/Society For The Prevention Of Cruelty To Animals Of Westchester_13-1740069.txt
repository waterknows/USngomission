The SPCA of Westchester was founded in 1883. Today, it is the only humane society in Westchester County empowered to enforce laws relating to animal cruelty. The SPCA's services include shelter and rehabilitation for abused, abandoned, and lost animals; adoption services; low-cost veterinary services; cruelty investigations; community outreach programs; and lost and found services. The SPCA of Westchester is located on several acres, with four separate kennel areas for dogs, a cattery and feline pavilion for cats, and the Simpson Spay/Neuter Clinic. At the present time, the Shelter is equipped to house over 100 dogs and many, many cats. Since 1983, we have spayed/neutered almost 38,000 dogs and cats thereby greatly reducing the number of unwanted animals in Westchester County.
