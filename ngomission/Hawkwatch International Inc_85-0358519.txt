The mission of HawkWatch International (HWI) is to conserve our environment through education, long-term monitoring, and scientific research on raptors as indicators of ecosystem health. We believe that through our efforts to monitor and protect birds of prey (also known as raptors), we can also protect our shared environment, our rich natural heritage, and ourselves. HWI was founded in 1986. The core of HWI's research program focuses on the development and maintenance of a long-term, large-scale database of raptor population numbers and trends. HWI conducts education programs using live raptors to stress the essential importance of nature's complex inter-relationships, the value of raptors as environmental barometers, and to promote environmental awareness and responsibility.
