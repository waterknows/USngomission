Incorporated in 1955, the Southern Scholarship Foundation works to help deserving young people who lack financial resources, but demonstrate excellent academic merit and moral character, attend institutions of higher education. Today the Foundation owns and/or operates a total of 25 scholarship houses; thirteen at Florida State University, three at Florida A&M University in Tallahassee, eight at the University of Florida in Gainesville, and one at Florida Gulf Coast University in Ft. Myers. We are currently housing 400 students and have assisted more than 8,000 students since our inception.
