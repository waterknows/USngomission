Alternative House, founded in 1972, provides support to at-risk children, youth and families through counseling, shelter, crisis intervention and neighborhood outreach. Our programs recognize that families are interdependent and that a crisis or challenge facing one family member affects everyone. We therefore empower children, teens and families to work together and build on their strengths. Our programs include: emergency shelter for teenagers, community outreach; Assisting Young Mothers (AYM); and Homeless Youth Initiative.
