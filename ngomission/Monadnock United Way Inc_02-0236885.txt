Founded in 1952, Monadnock United Way is an autonomous and independent organization governed by a Board of community members. Our accountability is to our local volunteers and donors. Decisions on which programs to fund and all other operating and policy decisions are made here in the Monadnock Region. Although Monadnock United Way is best known for conducting an annual campaign which provides funding for needed services to people in the region, community building represents an equally major effort. Monadnock United Way collaborates with a variety of partners to help identify and address emerging issues and specific human service needs. These partners include social service providers, foundations, local government, education and the medical community.
