Covenant House New York, is the nation's largest adolescent care agency serving homeless, runaway and at-risk youth. Our doors are open 24 hours a day for youth in need. Each year nearly 7,000 youth seek out our Crisis and Community Centers for safety, shelter, food and someone to talk to -- and that's just the beginning! Our services will address the immediate needs of young people in crisis, and facilitate their transition to adulthood and self-sufficiency. Begun over 30 years ago when six young runaways were given shelter from a snowstorm, Covenant House now has programs in 21 U.S. cities and Latin America. More than 77,000 young people are aided annually by Covenant House in its national and international programs.
