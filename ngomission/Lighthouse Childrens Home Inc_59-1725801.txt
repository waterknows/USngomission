The Lighthouse Children's Home has been operating since 1977 and is a full time Christian residential facility for teenage girls ages 13-17 who either have no home or are having discipline problems. We believe The Lord alone is the great changer of hearts, lives, and attitudes. The girls attend church every week as well as chapel services and devotion times both in the school and dorm. All of the counseling for the girls is done from a pastoral and spiritual perspective. This spiritual emphasis also includes a ministry of singing (gospel music and hymns only). The girls travel and sing all year throughout Florida, Georgia, and Alabama. Through the years the Lighthouse has recorded eleven CD's.
