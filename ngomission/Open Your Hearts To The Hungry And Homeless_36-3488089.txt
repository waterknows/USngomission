Founded in 1986, Open Your Heart to the Hungry and Homeless (OYH) seeks to help hungry and homeless Minnesotans through grants to food and shelter providers and to raise awareness of the needs of people who are hungry and homeless. As a mission-driven organization, OYH assists the community in three primary areas: we help alleviate hunger by providing financial assistance statewide to local food shelves, food banks and on-site feeding programs; we help ease the burdens of homelessness throughout Minnesota by funding homeless shelters and transitional and permanent supportive housing programs; and we meet the frequently over-looked needs of homeless school children by giving education grants to homeless shelters and housing programs that serve them.
