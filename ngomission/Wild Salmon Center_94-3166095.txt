The Wild Salmon Center is an international science-based organization whose mission is to identify, understand and protect the best wild salmon ecosystems of the North Pacific. We are committed to conserving for future generations the productivity, abundance, and biological diversity of wild salmon runs, and the healthy freshwater and coastal systems that sustain them. We envision a future where people throughout the North Pacific work together as stewards to sustain wild salmon and the immense benefits they provide people, rivers, and their watersheds.
