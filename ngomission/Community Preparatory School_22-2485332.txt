The school's goal is to help its students succeed in college-preparatory high school programs and to become community leaders. Community Preparatory School challenges students to become confident, independent learners and develops a strong sense of public service in students through community service and stewardship. It engages parents, students and teachers in goal-setting and planning in an effort to ensure academic and social success for each student.
