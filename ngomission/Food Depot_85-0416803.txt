The Food Depot strives to end hunger in Northern New Mexico. The food bank collects food and related products through collaborative relationships with the food industry, governments, other food banks, and the community. The Food Depot distributes what we collect through our network of charitable food providers to feed those who suffer from hunger. The Food Depot distributes an average of 400,000 pounds of food and household products, providing 500,000 meals each month. The food bank serves people in need through 135 nonprofit partner agencies in nine Northern New Mexico counties -- Santa Fe, San Miguel, Rio Arriba, Taos, Mora, Colfax, Los Alamos, Union and Harding. The agencies we supply include food pantries, hot meal programs, homeless shelters, youth programs, group homes, senior centers, day care centers and domestic violence shelters.
