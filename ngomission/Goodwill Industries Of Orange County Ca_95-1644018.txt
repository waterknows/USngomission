Goodwill of Orange County began helping people to help themselves in 1924. Our mission is to provide people with disabilities and other barriers the opportunity to achieve their highest levels of personal and economic independence. Goodwill of Orange County envisions a world where all individuals with disabilities and other barriers will have the opportunity to participate in a full range of life's experiences, including competitive employment. In support of this vision, we will maintain leadership in creating and providing quality education, training, and employment services to empower individuals to be productive and independent, based on their abilities and interest.
