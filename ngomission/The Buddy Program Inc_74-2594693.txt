Founded in 1989, the Buddy Program strengthens the community by guiding and inspiring youth through mentoring. For 40 years, the Buddy Program has been pairing qualified mentors with young people referred to the program. In response to increased demand for services, the Buddy Program extended one-on-one mentoring and implemented additional benefits for participating youth, including therapeutic counseling, scholarships for extra-curricular activities and continuing education, and connecting youth and their families with other agencies as necessary.
