Founded in 1972, the Denver Center for the Performing Arts (DCPA) is an exhilarating mix of Broadway shows, professional theatre, amateur- and graduate-level acting instruction, and dazzling venues. We annually serve more than 750,000 patrons from the Western region and beyond. As the flagship theatre of the Rocky Mountain region, the DCPA creates and presents exceptional theatre that engages, excites, provokes and inspires both artists and audiences. We embrace the classics while also striving to create new plays and musicals that advance the American theatre. We are committed to making the DCPA a center for lifelong learning and civic engagement.
