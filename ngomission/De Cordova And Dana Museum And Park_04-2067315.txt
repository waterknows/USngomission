Opened in 1950, the DeCordova Museum and Sculpture Park is a public museum of art established to educate as broad and diverse a public as possible about modern and contemporary American art. The Museum accomplishes this mission by focusing primarily, though not exclusively, on the art of the New England region. DeCordova educates through exhibitions, collections, classes, outreach programs, and a full schedule of activities designed to enhance our public's engagement with art and artists. With over 3,000 works in its holdings, the Museum features an important permanent collection of New England contemporary art. DeCordova currently offers the only permanent public sculpture park in New England. Close to 80 modern and contemporary works grace the 35-acre site. DeCordova plays a critical role in preserving today's regional art for future generations.
