Engineering Ministries International (EMI) is a Christian development organization made up of architects, engineers and design professionals who donate their skills to help children and families around the world step out of poverty and into a world of hope. Engineering Ministries International designs facilities (including buildings, roads, clean water projects and more) that directly impact communities by meeting physical needs and communicating God's love in a practical way. We partner with Christian workers, pastors, and other non-profits who have a vision to help the poor and preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Since 1982, we've worked on almost 800 relief and development projects in 80 countries. Last year, we worked on 74 projects, closed out many others and donated over 56,392 hours in services to our client partners.
