Founded in 1979, the National Peace Corps Association (NPCA) strives for a world in peace, shaped by understanding and tolerance. NPCA leads the Peace Corps community and others to foster peace by working together in service, education and advocacy. NPCA's goals are to: promote the vitality of the Peace Corps and the application of its values; establish the NPCA as the essential resource for and about the Peace Corps community; and enable NPCA members to build upon and extend the Peace Corps experience and values by facilitating their engagement in global issues. The NPCA and its member groups produce global education programs and advocacy campaigns, and provide community, national and international services. It is not a part of the United States Peace Corps, which is a federal agency.
