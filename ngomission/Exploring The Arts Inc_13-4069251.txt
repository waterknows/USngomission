Exploring the Arts (ETA) was founded in 1999 by Tony Bennett and Susan Benedetto. ETA's mission is to strengthen the role of the arts in public high school education. ETA's programs connect private funders, individual artists, and cultural institutions to Partner Schools to achieve greater equality of resources and opportunity for youth of all means and backgrounds. ETA currently serves 17 Partner Schools throughout New York City's five boroughs and in East Los Angeles.
