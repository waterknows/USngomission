Ronald McDonald House Charities of Madison (RMHC-Madison) is dedicated to advancing the well-being and health of children. We provide a home away from home for families whose children (18 and under) are undergoing treatment at Madison area health care facilities. The House allows families to stay together during an often very difficult time. Through the Ronald McDonald Care Mobile, we provide free dental services in south central Wisconsin and free medical and dental services in northern Illinois.
