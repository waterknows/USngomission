The V Foundation for Cancer Research was founded by ESPN and Jim Valvano in 1993. Since then, The V Foundation has raised more than $150 million and awarded cancer research grants in 38 states and the District of Columbia. Researchers have developed their laboratories and taken their science from the labs to the clinics with the help of funds raised by The V Foundation. The V Foundation started with the dream of Jim Valvano, the passionate and committed former NC State basketball coach and award-winning broadcaster, as he battled cancer. The V Foundation has an excellent track record for finding and funding elite young scientists.
