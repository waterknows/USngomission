Penrickton Center for Blind Children was established in the City of Taylor, Michigan in 1952 by three families as a day nursery for blind pre-schoolers because no such program existed. Penrickton Center for Blind Children is a unique agency, providing five-day residential, day care, and consultation/evaluation services to blind, multi-disabled children ages one through twelve. Each program is individually designed to promote independence in all aspects of daily living. Penrickton Center utilizes its experience and expertise to train and serve families, children and professionals through support services, education and advocacy.
