The mission of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Ada County is to inspire and empower all young people, especially those who need it most, to realize their full potential as productive, responsible and caring citizens. Since February 1997, the Boys & Girls Clubs have provided fun and engaging after school and summer programs to thousands of the community's most vulnerable youth. The Boys & Girls Clubs offer a unique array of services not available elsewhere in the community. They offer a positive and unique place with individual attention to every Club member in order to develop character by emphasizing integrity, respect, self esteem, responsibility, and appreciation of life.
