Founded in 1902 in Saint Paul, Union Gospel Mission (UGM) has responded to the needs of homeless and hopeless people in the Twin Cities metro area for more than 100 years. Primarily known for its work with homeless and chemically dependent men, the Mission also has a long history of providing practical assistance for women and children. We provide comprehensive support services and education programs focused on techniques and habits for promoting long-term success. Our investment in each person is a precursor of his or her own investment in a more vibrant future. Our goal is to encourage people to value themselves as God values them, to see the value they have to offer the world, and to seek out a bright future as a fully contributing member of our community.
