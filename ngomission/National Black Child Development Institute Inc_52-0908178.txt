For the past 40 years, the National Black Child Development Institute has been steadfast in its mission to improve and advance the lives of Black children and their families, through advocacy and education. Along with our affiliate network - composed of volunteers from across the nation - we have worked to improve child welfare services, make universal early care and education a reality, build family support services, press for educational reform and provide vital information regarding our children's health. Preparing our children to function in a global society where having access to the latest technology is considered the norm makes education extremely critical to our future work. Every child deserves a chance, and we are committed to uncovering every chance available to our children.
