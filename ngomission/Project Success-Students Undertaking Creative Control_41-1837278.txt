Project SUCCESS motivates and inspires young people to dream about the future, helps them take steps to get there and gives them the tools they need to achieve their goals. We have a comprehensive curriculum delivered each month in a student's English classroom that provides time, space and support for students to reflect. We invite students and families to see professional theater. We host college tours, and provide students with support with their post-secondary plans. Each summer, we take middle school students on an immersive, seven day adventure in the wilderness, where they have opportunities to gain new skills, experience, and support.
