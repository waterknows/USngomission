Founded in 1992, The Brooklyn Youth Chorus Academy (BYCA) offers exceptional music training and choral performances to enrich the lives of its students and community. Through music study and professional-level performing experiences, BYCA unites children of diverse backgrounds and helps them develop into confident and expressive musicians and individuals. BYCA strives to advance the artistic role of youth choruses through innovative concert programming, collaborations, and the commissioning of new choral repertoire. BYCA currently serves more than 450 students in its own building at Cobble Hill and at its Bedford-Stuyvesant Music Annex.
