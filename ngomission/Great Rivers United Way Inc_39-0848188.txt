Great Rivers United Way is working to advance the common good to create opportunities for a better life for all. Great Rivers United Way focuses on the building blocks for a good life: education, income, and health. Everyone deserves opportunities to have a good life: a quality education that leads to a stable job, enough income to support a family through retirement, and good health. Advancing the common good is less about helping one person at a time and more about changing systems to help all of us. We are all connected and interdependent. We all win when a child succeeds in school, when families are financially stable, when people are healthy. United Way's goal is to create long-lasting changes by addressing the underlying causes of these problems.
