George Mark Children's House is a unique facility that provides the gift of time to children - and their families - who face life-limiting illnesses with care that is comprehensive, compassionate and leading-edge. We offer four main forms of care: Respite care (round-the-clock), transitional care, pain and symptom management, and end-of-life care for children with lifespan-limiting illnesses and their families. Additional services include ongoing support and bereavement programs. All services are guided by the principles of pediatric palliative care, which aims to relieve suffering associated with chronic, life-limiting conditions by providing comfort care, preserving the dignity and integrity of the child and family, and achieving the best quality of life possible, defined in partnership with the family and consistent with each family's culture and values.
