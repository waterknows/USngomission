The Society of St. Andrew was formed in 1979 as an intentional community of two families called to life and ministry together in Christ. It has grown into an ecumenical organization dedicated to leading others into lives of Christian community and service. We are a grassroots hunger relief ministry that relies on volunteers to glean nutritious produce from farmers' fields and orchards after harvest and deliver it to people in need across the United States. We envision a world in which physical and spiritual hungers are met through God's grace and abundance.
