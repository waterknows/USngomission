The Pike Place Market Foundation was established in 1982 to support the Pike Place Market's services for low-income people, including its Clinic, Senior Center, Food Bank and Child Care and Preschool. The Pike Place Market Foundation also supports the Market's heritage programs, public improvements and repairs to the Market's historic buildings, development of new low-income housing in the Market, and programs that assist the Market's farmers. The Pike Place Market Foundation serves the Market and downtown Seattle communities in many ways such as providing Market Fresh Coupons to low-income Market residents so they have access to fresh produce year-round, and connecting Seattle food banks and meal programs through FoodLink, a volunteer program that distributes the Market's unsold produce.
