The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) acts as a catalyst to advance energy efficiency policies, programs, technologies, investments, and behaviors. We believe that the United States can harness the full potential of energy efficiency to achieve greater economic prosperity, energy security, and environmental protection for all its people. ACEEE carries out its mission by: conducting in-depth technical and policy analyses; advising policymakers and program managers; convening conferences and workshops; assisting and encouraging media to cover energy efficiency policy and technology issues; educating consumers and businesses through our reports, books, conference proceedings, press activities, and websites.
