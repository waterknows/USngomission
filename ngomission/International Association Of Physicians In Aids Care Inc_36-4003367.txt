The Physicians Association for AIDS Care (PAAC) was the precursor to the International Association of Physicians in AIDS Care (IAPAC), which was incorporated in 1995 to represent HIV-treating physicians and allied healthcare professionals worldwide. Today, IAPAC is known as the International Association of Providers of AIDS Care -- a name change that took place on 1 December 2012 as formal acknowledgement of the contributions made by various cadres of professional and paraprofessional providers of HIV prevention, care, and treatment services. The mission of IAPAC is to craft and implement global educational and advocacy strategies to improve the quality of care provided to all people living with HIV/AIDS. IAPAC membership exceeds 17,000 clinicians and allied health professionals in over 100 countries.
