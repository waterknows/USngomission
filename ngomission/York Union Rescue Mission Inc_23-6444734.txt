York Rescue Mission (YRM) is a religious organization that has been in existence for over forty-six years. The Mission began with the objective to offer food, clothing, shelter and spiritual guidance for the poor and needy of York County. Since early 1962, the developing of this goal has continued. There are ten buildings used to shelter, feed, clothe, teach and educate men, women and children. Three additional buildings serve as our Economy Stores which supply needed items for clients and others in the community. There are three ministries at YRM: the Women's Ministries, the Men's Ministries, and the Lighthouse Youth Center Ministry. Every ministry has its own characteristics and programs.
