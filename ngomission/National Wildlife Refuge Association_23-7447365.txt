The National Wildlife Refuge Association (Refuge Association) occupies a special niche as the only non-profit organization focused exclusively on promoting the world's largest wildlife conservation network, the National Wildlife Refuge System. Since 1975, the Refuge Association has worked hand-in-hand with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to protect, conserve, and restore the ecological integrity of the Refuge System. To accomplish our mission and raise the stature of the Refuge System, the Refuge Association engages thousands of supports including Refuge Friends groups, private landowners, hunters and anglers, and educators and students from all walks of life. In addition, the Refuge Association leads a coalition of 23 diverse organizations called the Cooperative Alliance for Refuge Enhancement (CARE) and our combined 16 million members urge Congress to provide robust funding for the Refuge System. The Refuge Association is ensuring a future for wildlife across America.
