Founded in 2003, StoryCorps' mission is to provide Americans of all backgrounds and beliefs with the opportunity to record, share, and preserve the stories of our lives. With a relentless focus on recording the stories of everyday people, StoryCorps captures lives that would otherwise be lost to history and reminds the nation that every story matters and every voice counts. Over the past seven years, we've given more than 70,000 Americans the chance to record interviews about their lives, pass wisdom from one generation to the next, and leave a legacy for future generations through our archive at the Library of Congress. We also share select edited excerpts of these stories through weekly NPR broadcasts, animated shorts, our popular website, podcasts, and best-selling books. These powerful stories illustrate our shared humanity and how much more we share in common than divides us.
