United Way strives to improve the quality of life in South Mississippi by focusing on creating measurable outcomes in the areas of education, income and health. Our goal is to create long-lasting changes that prevent problems from happening in the first place. We invite you to join the thousands of South Mississippians who have already committed to LIVE UNITED by investing in our community, by speaking up for the issues that matter, and by volunteering to help others.
