As the industry's charity, Jewelers for Children (JFC) is generously supported by those who create and sell fine jewelry and watches. Manufacturers, retail jewelers, trade associations, watch companies and those who provide professional services to the jewelry industry unite on behalf of children. Since 1999, nearly $30 million has been invested in special programs to reach children whose lives have been devastated by catastrophic illness or life-threatening abuse and neglect.
