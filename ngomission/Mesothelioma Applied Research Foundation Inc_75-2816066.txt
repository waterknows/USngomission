The Mesothelioma Applied Research Foundation (Meso Foundation) is the national organization dedicated to eradicating mesothelioma as a life-ending disease by: funding the highest quality and most promising research projects from around the world through our rigorous peer-reviewed process; helping patients connect with national meso experts and obtain the most up-to-date information on treatment options; and advocating in Washington D.C. for federal mesothelioma research funding to stop this national tragedy. We also raise awareness of meso, and advocate that the public and private sectors partner in the effort to cure it by directing the resources needed to stop this tragedy.
