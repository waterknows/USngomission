Special Olympics Florida was founded in 1972 and is one of the largest volunteer-driven athletic organizations in the state. The mission of Special Olympics Florida is to provide year-round sports training and competition in a variety of Olympic-type sports for people with intellectual disabilities who wish to participate, giving them continuing opportunities to develop physical fitness, demonstrate courage, experience joy and participate in the sharing of gifts, skills, and friendship with their families, other Special Olympics athletes, and the community.

The ultimate objective of Special Olympics Florida is to help people with intellectual disabilities participate as productive and respected members of society at large.
