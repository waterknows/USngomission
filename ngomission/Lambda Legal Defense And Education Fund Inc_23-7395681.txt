Founded in 1973, Lambda Legal is a national organization committed to achieving full recognition of the civil rights of lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, transgender people and those with HIV through impact litigation, education and public policy work. At Lambda Legal, we imagine a different world - a world of full equality for lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, transgender people and people with HIV - and we work to create that world every day. We pursue impact litigation, education and advocacy to make the case for equality in state and federal court, the Supreme Court and in the court of public opinion. The work we do has impact on the way we live - we change laws, policies and ideas.
