Our mission is to surround students with a community of support, empowering them to stay in school and achieve in life. We are actively engaged with policy makers, school staff, parents and business partners to ensure that Communities In Schools' services are extended to as many K-12 students as possible and that those students have access to college. Independent research demonstrates that Communities In Schools is one of a very few organizations proven to keep students in school and the only one to document that it increases graduation rates. The study also shows that a higher percentage of students served by Communities In Schools reach proficiency in 4th-grade and 8th-grade reading and math.
