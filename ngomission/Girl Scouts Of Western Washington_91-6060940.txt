Girl Scouts of Western Washington (GSWW) serves more than 26,000 girls in grades K-12 in Western Washington. Girls participate in age-based programs as part of a troop or as individual Girl Scouts. GSWW offers girls camping and hands-on outdoor education opportunities at six camp properties located in Longview, Hoquiam, Belfair, Carnation and Lilliwaup on the Hood Canal. In addition to providing year-round program opportunities for girls, GSWW's camps are used by school groups and other youth-serving non-profits for environmental education and learning experiences. GSWW is the result of a merger between Girl Scouts of the Totem Council and Girl Scouts of the Pacific Peaks Council.
