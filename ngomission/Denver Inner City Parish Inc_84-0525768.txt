Denver Inner City Parish ((DICP) welcomes and empowers people in need through support, determination and community. We have been consistently renewing and enhancing lives since 1960. The overarching problem that the DICP works to solve is that there is a growing number of working families living in poverty in Colorado who cannot meet their basic needs, therefore the cycle of poverty remains prevalent in our communities. The ultimate goal of the DICP is to strengthen Denver's working poor community members so they become more self-sufficient and are equipped with the skills to break the cycle of poverty in their families, neighborhoods and communities.
