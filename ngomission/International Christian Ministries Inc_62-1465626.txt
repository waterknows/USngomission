International Christian Ministries was launched in 1986 to meet the growing need for discipleship in Kenya. The focus of the ministry has always been the training, equipping and discipling of leaders to serve the church and fulfill the Great Commission. Over the years the model evolved to include two main avenues for developing Christian leaders: the Christian Leadership Institute (CLI) and Africa Theological Seminary (ATS). Both of these programs focus on providing quality training with aim of discipling participants. Currently ICM is registered in 12 countries and works in over 20 countries.
