Founded in 1993, Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs (OCPA) accumulates, evaluates, and disseminates public policy ideas and information for Oklahoma consistent with the principles of free enterprise, limited government, and individual initiative. OCPA's vision is to be recognized as a highly respected independent public policy institute, whose research, analysis, and commentary guides the formation of Oklahoma's public policies and helps Oklahoma to become the leader, specifically within our seven-state region, in all aspects of economic performance and quality of life issues.
