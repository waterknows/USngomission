The Albright-Knox Art Gallery, one of the nation's oldest public arts organizations, has a clear and compelling mission to acquire, exhibit, and preserve both modern and contemporary art. It focuses especially on contemporary art, with an active commitment to taking a global and multidisciplinary approach to the presentation, interpretation, and collection of the artistic expressions of our times. In an enriching, dynamic, and vibrant environment that embraces diverse cultures and traditions, the Gallery seeks to serve a broad and far-reaching audience. The Gallery's parent organization, the Buffalo Fine Arts Academy, was incorporated in 1862 to promote, cultivate, and generally foster art in all its branches.
