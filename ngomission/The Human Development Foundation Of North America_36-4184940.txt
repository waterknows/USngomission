The Human Development Foundation of North America (HDF) was formed in 1997 to facilitate a non-political movement for a positive social change and community empowerment through mass literacy, enhanced quality of education, universal primary health care and grassroots economic development. In the past ten years, HDF has worked towards the goals of health and human development in Pakistan. We do this through programs in the areas of community empowerment, education, healthy families, self help infrastructure improvements and economic self-sufficiency. For the past decade, HDF has helped more than 200,000 of the most underprivileged people in all four provinces of Pakistan.
