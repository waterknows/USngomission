The Hereditary Disease Foundation (HDF) aims to cure genetic illness by supporting basic biomedical research. The Foundation uses Huntington's disease as a model for hereditary disease research because it is triggered by a mutation of one single gene. Progress toward treatment or a cure could be instrumental in finding ways to treat other illnesses with more complex genetics, including Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, Lou Gehrig's disease (ALS), depression, schizophrenia, and cancer.
