Global Celebration is committed to proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ through missions, conferences, schools and leadership training. Founders Georgian and Winnie Banov carry a strong passion for the poor. During their travels they find themselves coming into partnership with others who share the same compassion. While Global Celebration has launched their own projects such as a regional leadership center in Bulgaria to serve impoverished Gypsies, they also work with field partners (the 'real deals') who are faithfully doing the work of Jesus but are in need of financial/ministerial support. As a result, Global Celebration currently supports orphanages in India, Burma, Thailand, Cambodia and Nicaragua. They have also adopted 200 first grade students in Mozambique, supporting them all the way through the twelfth grade (graduation date: 2023). Global Celebration also supports field partners who rescue children from sex trade industry in Thailand and the Philippines.
