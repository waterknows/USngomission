Camp Highland traces its early beginnings back to Lula, Georgia, 1993. As early as our first session, God made his purpose for Camp clear -- to lead others into a growing relationship with Him through high-adventure. Under the leadership of our board of directors, the path for Camp Highland's outreach began to take shape. Bill Chapman, director and founder, along with his wife Betsy and a small group of trained volunteers introduced schools, churches and businesses to the thrill of growing to know Christ through high-adventure. Our goal is to treat our guests to the thrill of a lifetime, while exposing them to teachable moments that lead them into a deeper walk with Christ. In the past seventeen years Camp Highland has been privileged to touch many lives through this exciting ministry, and this year promises to be as exciting as ever!
