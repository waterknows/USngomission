Founded in 1990, the Boys & Girls Clubs of Harford County enable all young people to reach their full potential as productive, caring, responsible citizens. In every community, boys and girls are left to find their own recreation and companionship in the critical after school hours. It is at these times that many young people become introduced to or participate in unhealthy activities. To combat this, the Boys & Girls Clubs of Harford County provides services to these youth to offer a healthy alternative. The Boys & Girls Clubs of Harford County provide a safe place to learn and grow, ongoing relationships with caring, adult professionals, life-enhancing program and character development experiences, and hope and opportunity.
