The Wildlife Center of Virginia was formed in 1982 to provide quality health care, often on an emergency basis, to native wildlife. Since its inception, the Wildlife Center has treated more than 47,000 wild animals, representing 200 species of native birds, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians; shared the lessons learned from these cases with some 1.4 million school-children and adults across Virginia; and trained a corps of wildlife medicine practitioners, including veterinarians, veterinary technicians, and volunteer wildlife rehabilitators. Those who have benefited from the professional training programs offered by the Center may now be found on the cutting-edge of wildlife veterinary medicine around the world.
