At the Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater La Crosse we serve with one purpose: To inspire and empower all young people, especially those who need us most, to realize their full potential as productive, responsible, caring citizens. Concentrating on children from disadvantaged circumstances, we offer a sense of belonging and the tools to make positive choices to each child who comes to our Clubs.
