Harvest Evangelism is an inter-denominational ministry committed to the fulfillment of the Great Commission (Matthew 28:19,20). The Harvest team, led by founder and president Ed Silvoso, is dedicated to serving the entire Body of Christ around the globe while instilling vision for city, regional and nation-wide transformation. The Five Pivotal Paradigms for Nation Transformation, the biblical principles of prayer evangelism (Luke 10: 1-9, I Timothy 2:1-8), marketplace transformation (Acts 2:17-21) and unity in the Body (John 13:35) form the core strategy for our efforts.
