It is the mission of the Boulder Shelter for the Homeless to provide safe shelter, food, support services, and an avenue to self-sufficiency for homeless adults in our community. We believe that all people deserve the basic necessities of life, and that the community in which we live is called to serve this purpose. Winter Sheltering services are available from October 1 through April 30 for any adult in need. Transition Program residents work closely with Shelter case managers to determine what has led them to homelessness, and what steps they must take to overcome their situation. Additional programs include morning services, Boulder County Cares, and Boulder County Housing First.
