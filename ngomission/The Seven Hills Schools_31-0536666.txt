Established in 1974, the Seven Hills School provides an education of superior quality in a college preparatory program which emphasizes academic excellence, individual expression and development, and service to school and community. Seven Hills cherishes community - and diversity in that community - and believes that students develop best when they work hard in an atmosphere of open inquiry, trust, mutual respect, civility and compassion. Seven Hills students are encouraged to find out who they are and where their talents lie. The school helps them acquire the intellectual, aesthetic, moral, physical and social qualities they need to become participating citizens and responsible leaders.
