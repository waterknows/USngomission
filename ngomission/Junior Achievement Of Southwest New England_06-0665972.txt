Junior Achievement's purpose has been to educate and inspire young people to value free enterprise and understand business and economics to improve the quality of their lives. Our staff services 7 counties, including: Hartford, Litchfield, New Haven, Windham, Tolland, New London and Middlesex. Last year, more than 2,000 talented volunteers donated one of the most important things they have to offer...their time. These volunteers used their personal experiences to make the Junior Achievement curricula practical and realistic. Providing children with positive adult role models, who illustrate ways to build self-confidence, develop skills and find avenues of success in our free enterprise system, is a hallmark of Junior Achievement.
