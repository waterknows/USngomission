The Boys & Girls Clubs of Southwest Washington was first established on April 10, 2000 on the grounds of Hazel Dell Elementary School. The mission of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Southwest Washington is to enable all young people, especially those who need us most, to realize their full potential as productive, caring and responsible citizens. The Boys & Girls Clubs of Southwest Washington seek to provide a positive environment, quality programs, and lifelong learning skills for all school age youth in Vancouver and its surrounding areas, with special concern for those coming from disadvantaged circumstances.
