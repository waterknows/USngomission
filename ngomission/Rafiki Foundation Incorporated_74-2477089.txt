The Rafiki Foundation is a Christian organization whose goal is to help Africans know God and raise their standard of living. It was established in 1985 by Rosemary Jensen and other who desired to help Africans with Bible teaching and development. To accomplish its mission, Rafiki established ten Rafiki Training Villages within the African countries of Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria, Tanzania, Zambia, Malawi, Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda, and Ethiopia. These Villages provide living, educational, and medical facilities through Rafiki's five programs: Childcare (orphans), Education, Bible Study, Advanced Learning Institute, and Widows. Rafiki's work is both individual as well as exponential with the potential of reaching many children with Bible study and better education through its Rafiki Institute of Classical Education. Rafiki's K-12 Christian classical curriculum and teacher training is designed to create new private Christian classical schools throughout the ten countries in Africa.
