The mission of Women Employed is to improve the economic status of women and remove barriers to economic equity. Women Employed has one passion: to make life better for working women. We believe that all women deserve full and fair economic opportunities. That means better career options and higher pay, more opportunities for training and education, and strict enforcement of fair employment laws. Women Employed is a leading national advocate for women's economic advancement. We analyze workplace issues, educate policy makers, and build support to improve opportunities and incomes. Since 1973, Women Employed has fought to outlaw pay discrimination, pregnancy discrimination and sexual harassment and to strengthen federal equal opportunity policies and work/family benefits.
