Established in 1981 to address the growing problem of hunger, Operation Food Search (OFS) is a St. Louis food bank that distributes food free of charge helping to feed the poor and hungry. OFS distributes more than 1.5 million pounds of perishable and non-perishable food and household items to 300 food pantries and soup kitchens who offer emergency hunger-relief to nearly 120,000 poor people every single month. Nearly half the recipients are children. The OFS service area includes 30 Illinois and Missouri counties surrounding the City of St. Louis. OFS also increases awareness on issues of hunger and works to eliminate waste in the bi-state region.
