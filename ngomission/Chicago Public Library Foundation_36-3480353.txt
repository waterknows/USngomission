The Chicago Public Library Foundation was established in 1986 as an independent educational organization dedicated to working with the City of Chicago in a true public/private partnership to enrich the collections and programs of the Chicago Public Library. The Foundation has provided start-up funding for new programs, such as technology and expanded Sunday and evening service hours, that are now included in the Library's city-funded budget. The Foundation also provides on-going funding for collections, book acquisition and a variety of community-based programs that contribute to the excellence of the Library.
