Founded in 1988, All God's Children (AGC) is dedicated to the orphaned and disadvantaged children of Honduras. The ministry of AGC helped to build and create Hogar de Ni√±os Nazareth, a refuge of care and compassion, where the children were given food, shelter, medical care, spiritual training and love. A sponsorship program was also developed to match caring donors with individual children. Presently, almost 200 children at Hogar depend on the support of this organization. Girls and young boys live together in Hogar's main facility, sharing the chores and learning important job skills such as sewing and woodworking. Boys ages 8-19 reside on a working farm, complete with crops, livestock and a carpentry and welding shop.
