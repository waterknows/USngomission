Founded in 1996, The Make-A-Wish FoundationÂ® of Southern Nevada grants the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions to enrich the human experience with hope, strength, and joy. Fulfilling a child's wish provides a joyful and meaningful experience that benefits both the child and the family. We currently serve one of the fastest growing areas of the country serving the southern half of the state, encompassing the counties of Clark, Nye, Lincoln and Esmeralda. To date, over 1,550 wishes have been granted to children throughout the Southern Nevada region.
