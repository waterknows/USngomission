Since 1981, Ronald McDonald House Houston has been serving families with children undergoing treatment for life-threatening illnesses at Texas Medical Center institutions. We offer loving, home-like environments, where families can find support and share experiences with others, including in-hospital facilities and a freestanding 50-bedroom home for longer term stays. Ronald McDonald House Houston offers a home away from home providing care, compassion and hope to families with seriously ill children being treated in Texas Medical Center member institutions. We are proud to offer a safe and loving environment to all families of children facing a life threatening condition, including those in need of an organ transplant or fighting cancer.
