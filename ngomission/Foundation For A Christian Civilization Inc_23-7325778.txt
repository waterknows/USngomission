The American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and Property (TFP) was born of a group of Catholic Americans concerned about the multiple crises shaking every aspect of American life. Founded in 1973, TFP was formed to resist, in the realm of ideas, the liberal, socialist and communist trends of the times and proudly affirm the positive values of tradition, family and property. In addition to full-time members and supporters, the American TFP and its affiliate campaign, America Needs Fatima, count on over 120,000 supporting members nationwide who donate or promote TFP ideas. The TFP's America Needs Fatima campaign promotes audiovisual presentations on the Fatima message that personally reach over 50,000 people every year.
