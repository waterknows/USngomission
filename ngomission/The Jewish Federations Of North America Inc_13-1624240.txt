The Jewish Federations of North America represents 157 Jewish Federations and 400 Network communities, which raise and distribute more than $3 billion annually for social welfare, social services and educational needs. The Federation movement, collectively among the top 10 charities on the continent, protects and enhances the well-being of Jews worldwide through the values of tikkun olam (repairing the world), tzedakah (charity and social justice) and Torah (Jewish learning). The Jewish Federations of North America became the official name of what was formerly United Jewish Communities in October 2009. At that time, the organization also launched its new logo; the rebranding is part of an ongoing effort to create a stronger continental brand and to align the organization with and reflect the Jewish Federations' naming.
