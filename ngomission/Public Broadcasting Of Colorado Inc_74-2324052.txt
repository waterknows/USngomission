Colorado Public Radio (CPR) stations KVOD classical music and KCFR in-depth news are available through a network of transmitters and translators that serve approximately 80% of Colorado. CPR exists to enrich the Colorado community. We provide news, information and classical music for people who want to be informed, enlightened and entertained. CPR was formed in 1981, and CPR began broadcasting the current, two-channel network in 2001. No other public radio station in Colorado is devoted exclusively to in-depth news, nor is there a full-time 24-hour classical music station with the resources to create highly researched and produced stories and features. Colorado Public Radio is alone among local public radio organizations in providing a truly statewide service, with as much relevance for listeners in Pueblo and Vail as for listeners in Denver and Grand Junction.
