United Way of the Southern Tier's mission is to effectively mobilize the caring power of our community to help people improve their lives. Through our Impact Areas and Community Initiatives agendas, we are producing measurable results and creating a community where: families are stronger and safer; children feel the impact of caring adults in their lives; seniors are engaged and eating well; the uninsured and under-insured have access to healthcare; and individuals and families can attain economic self-sufficiency. Your donations support 110 programs offered by 69 nonprofit organizations that provide vital services that help people improve their lives.
