The Texas State Aquarium works to provide educationally enriching, entertaining programming to a diverse audience; to develop entertaining interactive exhibits that engage and inspire; to promote and practice environmental conservation and wildlife rehabilitation; and to provide first-class guest services. The Texas State Aquarium opened July 6, 1990; since that time, more than seven million visitors have experienced the Aquarium. The Aquarium also educates over 60,000 children annually. As part of our mission, the Aquarium provides educational programs that are both entertaining and enriching and support the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) test. We offer self-guided tours, guided tours, gallery programs, behind-the-scenes tours, camp-ins, outreach programs, and much more.
