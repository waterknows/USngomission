The Fitton Center for Creative Arts was a gift to the community from the bicentennial commission to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the founding of Hamilton. It opened in 1993 and the Carruthers Center for Arts and Technology was opened in celebration of the 10th anniversary of the Fitton Center. The Fitton Center is a not-for-profit community arts center featuring a variety of programs, including: visual and performing arts classes, exhibitions, entertainment and theatre productions, for all ages. The Fitton Center's purpose is to provide unique arts experiences and to "build community excellence through the arts and culture."
