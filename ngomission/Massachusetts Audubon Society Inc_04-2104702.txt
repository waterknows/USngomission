Established in 1896, the Massachusetts Audubon Society (Mass Audubon) is the largest conservation organization in New England, working to protect the nature of Massachusetts for people and wildlife. Mass Audubon cares for more than 35,000 acres of conservation land, provides educational programs for 200,000 children and adults annually, and advocates for sound environmental policies at the local, state, and federal levels. Our statewide network of 55 wildlife sanctuaries welcomes visitors of all ages and serves as the base for our conservation, education, and advocacy work as well as providing people with much-needed places for recreation and relaxation, and a home for more than 150 endangered and threatened native species.
