At United Way of Erie County, we are working to reduce poverty in our region and create opportunities for a better life for everyone. We recruit people and organizations from across the community who bring the passion, resources and expertise needed to get things done. United Way of Erie County is a local organization that is accountable to our investors and our community. We are governed by a local board of directors and all decisions are made at the local level. Thanks to the generous community support we receive, United Way helps improve the lives of one out of every three people in Erie County in each year. Last year alone, over 100,000 men, women and children in our region were touched by United Way.
