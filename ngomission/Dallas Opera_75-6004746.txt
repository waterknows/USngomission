Since its glittering, 1957 inaugural concert with the legendary Maria Callas, The Dallas Opera has made a national and international name for itself by discovering new world-class talents and enhancing the careers of important artists, directors and designers. As The Dallas Opera enters its 51st international season, the future has never looked brighter. The current leadership has plans to guide the company through its 50th Anniversary Celebrations and into our new home in the Margot and Bill Winspear Opera House at The Dallas Center for Performing Arts. The Dallas Opera is scheduled to open its 2009-2010 Season in the new Winspear Opera House, where it will be the resident company.
