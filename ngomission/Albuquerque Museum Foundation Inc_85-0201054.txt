The mission of the Albuquerque Museum Foundation, founded in 1961, is to further the cultural and educational programs at the Albuquerque Museum through broad public and private gifts and volunteer support. As an independent nonprofit corporation, the Foundation's purpose is to encourage the development of the Museum as the outstanding museum of its kind in the Southwest. The Foundation funds the Museum's education, Magic Bus and docent programs, provides additional exhibition funding which brings world-class shows to the Museum, and makes possible amenities like the Museum Store and the caf√©, Slate at The Museum. The Foundation also manages The Museum's membership program.
