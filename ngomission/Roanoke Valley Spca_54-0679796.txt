Founded in 1916, the Roanoke Valley SPCA (RVSPCA) is an organization whose purpose is to improve the quality of life for animals and the people they touch in the Roanoke Valley. We strive to accomplish this mission by providing food, shelter, medical care and companionship to the homeless and unwanted companion pets of our area. By providing humane education, pet assisted therapy, meaningful volunteer experiences, and pet/owner training classes, we emphasize the importance of the human/animal bond and help to create loving relationships between pet and guardian. The functions of the RVSPCA are divided into two components; the Barbara & Warner Dalhouse Adoption & Education center and the Regional Center for Animal Control & Protection.
