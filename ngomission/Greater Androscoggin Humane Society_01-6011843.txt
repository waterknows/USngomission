The Greater Androscoggin Humane Society is committed to promoting a humane community by providing the best possible care for stray, abandoned and abused animals. The Society, formerly known as the Lewiston-Auburn SPCA, was founded in 1885. As our community has grown and changed over time, the Society has grown along with it. Today we take in nearly 5,000 animals a year. For over thirty years, our main concern has been dealing with pet overpopulation, so we now spay or neuter every cat, kitten, dog, puppy and rabbit before adoption. In addition to our animals, we also offer our neighbors a low-cost Community Spay/Neuter Program.
