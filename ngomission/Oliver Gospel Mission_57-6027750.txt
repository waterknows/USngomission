Oliver Gospel Mission strives to see that the broken and homeless are sheltered, given the gospel of Jesus Christ, and equipped to live responsibly. We minister to the community's homeless by providing meals, shelter, and spiritual direction. Our Christ-centered Leadership Development Recovery Program (CLD) is designed to help men escape their addictions to drugs and alcohol. This program is devised to transform men's lives from within through biblical teaching, counseling, educational assistance, and guidance in choosing a career and finding employment. For over 120 years Oliver Gospel Mission has done more than feed and shelter the hungry and homeless. The Mission works to transform lives.
