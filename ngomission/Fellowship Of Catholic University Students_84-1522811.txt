Answering the Church's call for a new evangelization, FOCUS, the Fellowship of Catholic University Students, is a national outreach that meets college students where they are and invites them into a growing relationship with Jesus Christ and the Catholic faith. Rooted in Sacred Scripture and Sacred Tradition, FOCUS was born out of a passion and zeal to share how a relationship with Jesus Christ and the Catholic faith can transform the world. Beginning with our nation's future leaders, FOCUS sends teams of young, trained missionaries to the college campus in order to reach students with the gospel. In partnership with the university parish and/or Newman Center, FOCUS missionaries host large group outreach events, weekly Bible studies and offer one-on-one mentoring with student leaders. Through the personal investment and dedication of our missionaries, FOCUS helps to build a joyful, Christ-centered community and support network on each campus where we have a presence. Students are encouraged to join the missionaries at daily Mass and in prayer, the most vital commitment our missionaries make each day.
