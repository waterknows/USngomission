The Nehemiah Center is a Christian-based organization that offers academic, emotional, cultural, social and spiritual enrichment for at-risk children and their families in Houston's Third Ward and beyond. Our mission is to create a safe haven in which children are motivated, inspired, and equipped to realize their God-given potential. Our vision is to help develop in a child a sense of self-worth, Christian values and direction that will ensure his/her lifetime self-determination.
