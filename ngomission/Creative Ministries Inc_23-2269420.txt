Founded in 1984, WJTL - Creative Ministries Inc. is a listener supported, non-commercial radio station that plays Contemporary Christian Music. We value our involvement in the local and international community through promoting and attending live events, interviewing organizations and ministries on the Get Up and Go Show, bringing awareness to our listeners about missions opportunities all over the world and even heading out ourselves. WJTL's purpose is to glorify God, encourage believers, and be a shining light to the world and lead others through Christ.
