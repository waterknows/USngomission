Founded in 1992, the mission of Shoes That Fit is to provide new shoes for children in need so they can attend school in comfort and with dignity, better prepared to learn and play. We are run almost entirely by volunteers working to help children in their own communities across the U.S. We do this by matching a sponsoring group - a business, school, church, civic organization or even a group of friends - with schools near them that have children in need. New shoes that are appropriate for school help these children fit in, allowing them to concentrate on their studies rather than their circumstances.
