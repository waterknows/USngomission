Feed My People was founded in October 1982, by John and Carol DeGuire. It was begun to meet the growing needs of the poor in South Saint Louis County, Missouri. Today we have over 20 programs, with a Thrift Store at each facility as primarily a service to our clients, but open to the public as well. The proceeds help fund our programs. Our main mission is emergency and long-term food help. We treat each person who comes to us for help with dignity. Besides their daily needs, we try to give them hope for a brighter future, and let them know that we care and that God cares.
