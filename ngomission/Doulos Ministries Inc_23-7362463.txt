Doulos Ministries exists to disciple, train and place Christian servant leaders to disciple youth and their families. Since 1981, Doulos has contributed to the development of Christ-centered leaders in ministry, business, within urban centers, and within families. The word "doulos" comes from the ancient Greek concept of being a servant, which is the kind of leadership that impacts this world for Christ. We accomplish our mission through the ministries of LeadTime and Shelterwood. LeadTime offers a one-year, ministry internship for young adults. Shelterwood is a Christ-centered, residential care facility seeking to bring healing and reconciliation to families with at-risk teens.
