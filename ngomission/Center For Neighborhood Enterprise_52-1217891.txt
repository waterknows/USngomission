The Center for Neighborhood Enterprise (CNE) was founded by Robert L. Woodson, Sr., in 1981 to help residents of low-income neighborhoods address the problems of their communities. Originally known as the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, the name was streamlined in February, 2006, to Center for Neighborhood Enterprise. CNE has headquarters in Washington, DC, but operates throughout the nation to help community and faith-based organizations with training, technical assistance, and linkages to sources of support. The Center chronicles and interprets their experiences to make recommendations for public policy and works to remove barriers that hamper their efforts to solve societal problems.
