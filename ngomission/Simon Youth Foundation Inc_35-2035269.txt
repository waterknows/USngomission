Simon Youth Foundation (SYF) began in 1998, after employees in Simon malls noticed a community need, the education of at-risk youth, and began a grassroots effort to make a difference. SYF helps at-risk kids in Simon mall communities nationwide earn high school diplomas and scholarships to realize hopes of going to college. The mission of SYF is to foster and improve educational opportunities, career development, and life skills that transform the lives of at-risk youth through focused programs and initiatives with our public school and post-secondary education partners. SYF's mission is accomplished in two ways: by working with local public school districts to establish the unique Education Resource Centers; and by providing post-secondary scholarships to ERC graduates and high school seniors.
