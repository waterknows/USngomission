Founded in 1977, the purpose of Shiloh Christian Children's Ranch is to provide Christian homes for abused/neglected and other children and to meet the spiritual, emotional, educational, social and physical needs of each child. Shiloh Christian Children's Ranch is a safe haven for children, where we believe that helping children puts you close to the heart of God. The ministry of Shiloh now includes a total of six such homes for children, two relief homes plus an onsite school at the Kahoka, MO site. Since our founding, hundreds of children, most from abusive, neglectful homes have received a second chance here. They've been able to experience the love of Jesus Christ and call Shiloh their home.
