Straight Ahead Ministries train and equip Christians to lead Bible Study discussion groups, facilitate recovery discussion groups, and mentor youth who are locked up in juvenile facilities, as well as provide effective aftercare models to help youth transition successfully back into the community. Our strength-based resources, curriculums, training modules, and direct ministry models help youthful offenders become all that God intended them to be. We welcome you to partner with us in what God is doing in the lives of juvenile offenders.
