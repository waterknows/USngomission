United Way of Greater Los Angeles fights poverty and improves the quality of life for all in Los Angeles County by meeting basic needs like housing and health care, improving the educational achievement of youth, and helping families become financially stable. We provide expert research on the issues, invest in direct service programs that produce results, focus on systems change and drive change through partnerships that bring about effective and stronger solutions. By focusing our efforts on local and state public policy, we treat many of the root causes of poverty through desperately needed systems-change.
