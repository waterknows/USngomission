New Heights creates opportunities and provides support for promising youth to fulfill their potential in the classroom, on the court and in the community. Our mission is to educate and empower promising inner-city youth to be leaders, champions and student-athletes by developing the skills necessary for success in high school, college and life. Specifically, our organization uses basketball as a "hook" to engage youth in the program, help them access high quality educational opportunities, and instill in them the values and life skills that will prepare them for success in life beyond sports.
