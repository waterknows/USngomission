Founded in 1982, the Fairbanks Community Food Bank collects and redistributes donated food to individuals and agencies. Our primary purpose is to provide food for hungry people and to distribute surplus food that would ordinarily be discarded. Food donations are received from the local community and about 100 commercial vendors. Food is distributed through many programs including Food Boxes, Bone Builders, and Agency Shopping.
