The Museum of Discovery's mission is to ignite a passion for science, technology, and math in a dynamic, interactive environment. The museum was originally accredited by the American Association of Museums in 1993 and was re-accredited in 2001. During the period between its founding and its accreditation, the museum actively collected approximately 14,000 cultural and historical artifacts and numerous species of live animals and insects. In the 1970s, in-museum and outreach programs were developed, utilizing both the collections and the museum's exhibits.
