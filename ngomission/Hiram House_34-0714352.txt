Founded in 1896, the mission of Hiram House is to enrich the lives of children through camping. We provide the youth of our community with an opportunity to live, play and learn in an environment that is racially, ethnically and socio-economically diverse. Hiram House is committed to promoting family values, building character and opening new horizons for youth. Hiram House Camp offers year-round outdoor education and recreation programs for youth, schools, churches, businesses, civic and other organizations through a variety of Summer Camps, School Camps, and Group Retreats.
