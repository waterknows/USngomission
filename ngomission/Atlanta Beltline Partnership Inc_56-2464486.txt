Founded in 2004, Atlanta BeltLine Partnership (ABLP) is a non-profit organization funded entirely through private endeavors. It is a sustainable redevelopment project that will provide a network of public parks, multi-use trails and transit along a historic 22-mile railroad corridor circling downtown and connecting many neighborhoods directly to each other. ABLP staff members work with neighborhoods, businesses, community and faith organizations, and other groups to raise general awareness, and broad-based support, for the Atlanta BeltLine. The Atlanta BeltLine is transforming the city with a combination of rail, trail, greenspace, housing and art.
