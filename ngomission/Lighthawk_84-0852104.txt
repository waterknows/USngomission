LightHawk's mission is to accelerate conservation success through the powerful perspective of flight. Flights promote informed decision-making, increase the efficiency and effectiveness of conservation action, and foster dialogue and build consensus. LightHawk's work is international in scope. We establish conservation partnerships with organizations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and Central America.  Our supporters enable LightHawk to donate environmental flight campaigns at no charge to our conservation partners. Founded in 1979, LightHawk is the largest and oldest volunteer-based environmental aviation organization in North America. Our business model is built on three pillars: volunteerism, partnerships, and philanthropy. LightHawk supporters use their philanthropy to uniquely add value to the conservation community by donating conservation flying.
