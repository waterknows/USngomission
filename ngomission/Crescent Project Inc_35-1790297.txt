Crescent Project's mission is to inspire, equip and serve the Church to reach the seven million Muslims in North America with the Gospel of Christ for the Glory of God. It is our vision to see a day when fear is replaced with love and millions of Christians are actively sharing the truth of Christ with millions of Muslims for the glory of God. We do this through prayer, training, local outreach, and short-term trips.
