Founded in 1992, the mission of the Georgia Transplant Foundation (GTF) is to help meet the needs of organ transplant candidates, living donors, recipients and their families by providing information and education regarding organ transplantation, granting financial assistance and being an advocate for sustaining and enriching lives everyday. GTF is focused on providing both financial and educational assistance during a time that is often overwhelming for those undergoing or waiting for a transplant. Today, GTF is the primary source for transplant patient assistance and support for all solid organ transplantation in the entire state of Georgia.
