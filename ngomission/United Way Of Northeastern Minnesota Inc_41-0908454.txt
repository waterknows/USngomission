The mission of the United Way of Northeastern Minnesota is to unite and focus our communities in creating measurable results to improve people's lives and strengthen our families. Together, we can accomplish more than any single group can on its own. The United Way of Northeastern MN is working in our local communities to make this happen by investing your contributions in critically needed programs being operated by our partner agencies as well as initiatives managed by our own staff and volunteers.
