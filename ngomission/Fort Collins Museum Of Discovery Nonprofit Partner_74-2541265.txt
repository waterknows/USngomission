Combining science with history and culture, the Fort Collins Museum of Discovery (FCMoD) connects you to a deeper understanding of your world and your place in it, from our local community to the global community beyond. FCMoD is a place where people can come together for shared events and experiences, a place for building community while providing inspiration and insight. This is the vision of the FCMoD, to create meaningful opportunities for people of all ages to learn, reflect, and have fun through hands-on and collections-based explorations in science and culture.
