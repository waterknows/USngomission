Madison Children's Museum (MCM) connects children with their families, their communities and the world beyond through discovery learning and creative play. The museum, founded 30 years ago, acquired a $5 million, five-story office building in 2005 through the generosity of the W. Jerome Frautschi. The museum recently completed a very successful $10 million capital campaign to renovate the building, create an accessible green roof, and install new exhibits. The new facility, which opened in August 2010, expanded the museum's capacity to serve older children and school groups in a strong interdisciplinary program that emphasizes the arts, sciences, culture, health, history, and civic engagement. It already has been ranked the fifth best children's museum in the country in Parents Magazine's March 2011 issue and has won several awards from professional organizations within the museum industry for emphasizing the use of local products, people, and processes in creating the new facility.
