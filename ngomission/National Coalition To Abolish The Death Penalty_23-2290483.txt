The National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty (NCADP) was founded in 1976 with the mission to abolish the death penalty in the U.S. and support efforts to abolish the death penalty worldwide. NCADP serves its network of over 100 state and national affiliates and provides them with technical assistance, training and strategic advice and assistance in devising public policy campaigns to end, limit or repeal the death penalty. For advocates committed to ending the death penalty, NCADP serves as a clearinghouse with contacts and information. NCADP produces reports, fact sheets and other public education materials for use in state campaigns. To support local efforts for policy change, NCADP also mounts national campaigns on specific death penalty cases and issues.
