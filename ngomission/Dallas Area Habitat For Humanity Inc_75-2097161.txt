Dallas Area Habitat for Humanity is a Christian ministry that builds quality, affordable homes in partnership with deserving families. Since our incorporation in 1986, Dallas Habitat has built over 850 homes and served as a catalyst for the revitalization of 20 communities. Dallas Area Habitat for Humanity provides affordable housing opportunities to families no other nonprofit or private mortgage lender in Dallas is able to serve. Qualified families are required to provide 400 hours of 'sweat equity' in lieu of a down payment, which is fulfilled by building their own home and the homes of other Habitat families. This hands-on participation builds new skills, a sense of tremendous accomplishment, and strong relationships with their neighbors.
