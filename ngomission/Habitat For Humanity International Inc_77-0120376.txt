Habitat for Humanity of Ventura County is an ecumenical Christian housing ministry seeking to eliminate poverty housing and homelessness from Ventura County and the world, making decent shelter a matter of conscience and action. We are a locally run affiliate of Habitat for Humanity International. Habitat for Humanity of Ventura County has served this county since 1983. Since then we have built 54 houses in partnership with families in need. Prior to our first land donation in 1993 from Charles Henderson, Habitat for Humanity of Ventura County exclusively repaired homes for low income and seniors. We have also repaired over 500 homes in Ventura County.
