The NCSL Foundation for State Legislatures is committed to the important work of strengthening state legislatures, counteracting cynicism and distrust of the legislative process and helping lawmakers confront and solve the critical issues of our time through a public-private dialogue. The Foundation for State Legislatures was created in 1982 by the National Conference of State Legislatures, the nation's preeminent bipartisan organization dedicated to serving the lawmakers and staff members of the nation's 50 states, territories, and commonwealths.
