Ronald McDonald House Charities of Phoenix is a welcoming "home away from home" for families with children facing medical challenges, providing an atmosphere of comfort, hope and courage. The families who benefit from RMHC travel far from home to receive treatment for their child at world-renowned pediatric centers located in Phoenix. Their child's treatment may last a day, a month, or even longer. It's a long time to be away from home or to divide a family, and often times commuting or staying at a hotel is either impossible or financially challenging for a family. RMHC is able to help families overcome these obstacles by providing low-cost, temporary housing that is near their child's hospital.
