Boston Harbor Island Alliance promotes the use, enjoyment, and awareness of the Boston Harbor Islands national park area by creating vibrant public spaces, facilities, and programming on the islands, raising and managing the public and private resources necessary to do so. The Alliance attracts and manages funds for educational, recreational, and environmental programs and projects, and assists state and federal agencies with implementing services. One of our primary objectives is to create the environmental stewards of tomorrow by bringing youth to the islands and educating them about their environment.
