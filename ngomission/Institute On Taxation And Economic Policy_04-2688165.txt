Founded in 1980, the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) is a non-partisan research and education organization that works on government taxation and spending policy issues. ITEP's unique resources and capabilities enable it to provide policymakers, advocates, and the public with accurate, useful, and timely information regarding state and federal tax systems and how they affect taxpayers at different income levels. ITEP's mission is to keep policymakers and the public informed of the effects of current and proposed tax polices on tax fairness, government budgets and sound economic policy.
