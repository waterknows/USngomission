The National MPS Society exists to find cures for MPS (Mucopolysaccharidoses) and related diseases. We provide hope and support for affected individuals and their families through research, advocacy and awareness of these devastating diseases. Since 1974 the Society has supported individuals and families affected with MPS and related diseases. MPS and related diseases are genetic lysosomal storage diseases caused by the body's inability to produce specific enzymes. While the symptoms of MPS and related diseases may vary from one syndrome to another, there are many similarities. Affected individuals often have mental retardation, cloudy corneas, short stature, stiff joints, incontinence, speech and hearing impairment, chronic runny nose, hernia, heart disease, hyperactivity, depression, pain and a dramatically shortened life span.
