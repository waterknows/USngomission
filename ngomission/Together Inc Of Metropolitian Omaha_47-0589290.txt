Together is a local, independent non-profit that was initially conceived in response to the tornado disaster in 1975 that struck the metropolitan area in 1975 and left hundreds of families homeless, hungry and in great need. The leaders of Countryside Community Church, Dundee Presbyterian, Temple Israel, Kountze Memorial Lutheran, Trinity Cathedral, First United Methodist, St. Cecilia's Cathedral, and many others organized the “Together” cooperative effort to meet the immediate needs of the hundreds of families that were struggling with the basic necessities of life: food, clothing, and shelter. However, our founders soon realized that thousands of families in Omaha need relief every day and opened the FREE services of Together to the community year round. This effort provided for ongoing human needs, primarily, the basic necessities of life: food and shelter.
