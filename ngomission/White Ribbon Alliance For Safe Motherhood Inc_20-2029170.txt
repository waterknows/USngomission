Founded in 1999, White Ribbon Alliance works to inspire and convene advocates who campaign to uphold the right of all women to be safe and healthy before, during and after childbirth. White Ribbon Alliance unites citizens to demand the right to a safe birth for every woman, everywhere. Our focus is on holding governments accountable and campaigning for them to deliver on their commitments. We mobilize citizens to demand decent and respectful health care for all pregnant women. Our activities are decided by the volunteer members of our network.
