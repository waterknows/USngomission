The Humane Society of Greater Dayton builds loving relationships between people and pets. Our vision is to build a community in which all animals are valued and family life is enhanced through relationships with pets. We find homes for homeless pets; reunite lost pets with their families; and lower pet overpopulation through proactive spay/neuter programs. We also work to eliminate animal abuse and neglect through cruelty investigations and community action; serve as a resource for pet owners to enhance the human-animal bond; collaborate with community organization and companies to make our programs more effective and strive to be the area's most proactive and effective animal-care agency. We have served Montgomery County for more than 100 years.
