Founded in 1070, RAYS' (Rention Area Youth & Family Services) mission is to strengthen the lives of children, youth and families by restoring hope and stability in the face of emotional conflict, substance abuse and poverty. In partnership with our community, we transform the lives of kids and families through comprehensive counseling, training and support.

Our vision is for all youth and families in our community to have the resources, support and strength they need to recover from substance abuse, mental health issues and other serious life challenges.
