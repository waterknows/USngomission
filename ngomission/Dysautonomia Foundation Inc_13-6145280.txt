The Dysautonomia Foundation is a nonprofit organization supporting the best possible medical care 

and scientific research for the benefit of people afflicted with Familial dysautonomia (FD). The Foundation also conducts social service and public awareness programs for the benefit of the FD community and for those in the general population who may be at risk for FD. FD is a rare genetic disease that affects the autonomic and sensory nervous systems of children from birth. The most striking symptoms of FD are reduced sensitivity to pain and temperature, and the inability to produce tears. But FD is much more than 'no pain and no tears', it affects every major system of the body, causing severe respiratory, cardiac, orthopedic, digestive and vision problems.
