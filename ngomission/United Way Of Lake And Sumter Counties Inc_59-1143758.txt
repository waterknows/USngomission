The United Way of Lake & Sumter Counties helps solve specific community issues that impact local families, seniors, children, and the disabled. Each community is different, therefore each community's issues are different. It is important to support your community where you live because it benefits those in need, your community as a whole, the local economy and you and your family as well. We raise money for various agencies within Lake and Sumter Counties.
