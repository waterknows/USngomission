Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation (ALSF) shares the vision of our founder and creator, Alexandra "Alex" Scott - a cure for all children with cancer. Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation was started by her parents in 2005 to continue the work that Alex began. Our mission is simple: to raise money for and awareness of childhood cancer cause - especially research into new treatments and cures - and to encourage and educate others, especially children, to get involved and make a difference for children with cancer. The money we've raised has helped us to: fund more than 150 cutting-edge research projects; create a travel program to help support families of children receiving treatment; and develop resources to help people everywhere touched by childhood cancer.
