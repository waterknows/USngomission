Aid For Starving Children has been helping to save the lives of children for over 30 years. Here in the US, we work with African-American children of Single Mothers. Our worldwide focus is on AIDS orphans, education, and community health and development. Aid For Starving Children belongs to a coalition of organizations on four continents, all of which share a common passion to save the world -- one child at a time. These entities are committed to coordinating their resources and efforts in order to achieve maximum results and efficiency.
