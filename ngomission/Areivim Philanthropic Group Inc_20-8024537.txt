Areivim Philanthropic Group identifies, analyzes and studies the issues that face the North American Jewish Community, particularly in the areas of formal and experimental Jewish, Hebrew and Israel education, and to determine areas of programmatic action through grantmaking and the sponsoring of programmatic development. This is accomplished by making grants to support Jewish and Hebrew educational and charitable organizations and programs, raising public awareness about these initiatives in North America and Israel, cooperating with other charitable organizations, and conducting other activities necessary to further these purposes.
