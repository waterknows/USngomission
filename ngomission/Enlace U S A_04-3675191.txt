Enlace believes the local church to be the primary agent to transform poor communities in El Salvador. Enlace commits to a 10 year relationship with a local church and equips the church to become an effective agent of change. We walk a church through a process of being "interested," then "committed" and eventually a "leader" in its community, replicating what it has learned through interaction with other churches in the area.

ENLACE's vision is to see 100 churches transform the spiritual and physical lives of 250,000 people in El Salvador by 2015.
