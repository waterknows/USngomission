The Princess Grace Foundation-USA is dedicated to identifying and assisting young talent in theater, dance, and film by awarding grants in the form of scholarships, apprenticeships, and fellowships. The foundation's trustees share Princess Grace's dedication to supporting the arts and they believe, as she did, that cultivation and training of emerging talent is essential to ensure sustained excellence in the arts. Each year, the foundation announces a select group of Princess Grace Awards for distinction in the areas of theater, dance, and film. Students are eligible for apprenticeships and fellowships; a playwriting fellowship is available through a residency at New Dramatists in New York City.
