For over 20 years, Way to Grow has been one of the preeminent early learning programs in the Twin Cities. We focus on the most important stages of life from prenatal to kindergarten and parenting. In October 2010, we launched the Great by Eight Initiative in partnership with the Minneapolis Public Schools. This new program expands our research-based model to grade three, age eight. We firmly believe that every child should be born healthy, stay healthy and have the equal opportunity to succeed in school and life. And that can only happen with parents' active participation. Through our in-home and center-based programming, we help parents create a healthy home and become their children's first and most important teachers.
