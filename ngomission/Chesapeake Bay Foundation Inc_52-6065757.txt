Founded in 1967, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation (CBF) is the only independent organization dedicated solely to restoring and protecting the Chesapeake Bay, the largest estuary in the United States and a national resource in critical condition. Working throughout the Chesapeake's six-state, 64,000 square mile watershed, CBF educates, advocates, litigates, and restores. Our strategy is to hold governments accountable for fully implementing and enforcing clean water laws and regulations and for improving legislative and regulatory protections where appropriate. Our vision is that the Chesapeake Bay and its tributary rivers will again be highly productive and in good health as measured by water quality standards.
