Founded in 1912, The Rochester Museum & Science Center (RMSC) stimulates broad community interest and understanding of science and technology, and their impact—past, present, future—on our lives. The RMSC continues to inspire our community by serving as the area's resource for informal science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education; providing more than 200 hands-on exhibits that promote inquiry-based learning; and investing in our area's future through our preschool, science day camps and workforce preparation and visitation assistance programs.
