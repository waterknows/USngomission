The UJA/Federation of Westport, Weston, Wilton and Norwalk is the central planning, fundraising, allocating, and community relations agency for our Jewish community. We link the local community with Israel and worldwide Jewry and strive to bring all Jews together to promote and sustain Jewish continuity and survival. We work together to unite our Jewish community in meeting the needs and improving the lives of Jews at home, in Israel, and around the world.
