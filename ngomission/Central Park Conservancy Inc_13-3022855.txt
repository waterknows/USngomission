The mission of the Central Park Conservancy is to restore, manage, and enhance Central Park, in partnership with the public, for the enjoyment of all. With 42 million visitors each year to its 843 acres, Central Park is the most frequently visited urban park in the United States. To manage the Park, Conservancy crews aerate and seed lawns; rake leaves; prune and fertilize trees; plant shrubs and flowers; maintain ballfields and playgrounds; remove graffiti; conserve monuments, bridges, and buildings; and care for waterbodies and woodlands, controlling erosion, maintaining the drainage system, and protecting over 150 acres of lakes and streams from pollution, siltation, and algae. The Central Park Conservancy is a private, not-for-profit organization founded in 1980 that manages Central Park under a contract with the NYC Dept. of Parks & Recreation. The Conservancy has invested nearly $800 million to date into the Park, making it a model for urban parks worldwide.
