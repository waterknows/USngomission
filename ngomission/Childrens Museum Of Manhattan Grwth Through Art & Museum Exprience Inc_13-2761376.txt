The mission of the Children's Museum of Manhattan (CMOM) is to inspire children and families to learn about themselves and our culturally diverse world through a unique environment of interactive exhibitions and programs. Last year, CMOM served more than 350,000 people, which included 65,000 children who visited the Museum as part of a school group or through one of the Museum's off-site partners. CMOM is committed to making its exhibits and programs available to all, and with nearly 50 sites around New York City, we continually reach thousands of families who might not otherwise be able to benefit from our services. CMOM's four priority areas are meant to impact children in ways that will last a lifetime: early childhood education; creativity in the arts and sciences; healthy lifestyles; and the exploration of world cultures.
