Greater Newark Conservancy promotes environmental stewardship to improve the quality of life in New Jersey's urban communities. Founded in 1987, the Conservancy has four program areas--environmental education, community greening and gardening, job training and advocacy for environmental justice. Our guiding principle is to encourage and highlight community empowerment, pride and self-sufficiency and to foster a lifelong appreciation of our natural world for thousands of urban residents each year. Greatest emphasis is placed on working with schools, community groups, youth organizations, senior citizens, intergenerational groups and adolescent urban youth.
