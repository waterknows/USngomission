Food Gatherers exists to alleviate hunger and eliminate its causes in our community by: reducing food waste through the rescue and distribution of perishable and non-perishable food; coordinating with other hunger relief providers; educating the public about hunger; and developing new food resources.Food Gatherers is not only Michigan's first food rescue program, but the first program of its kind to be founded by a for-profit business, Zingerman's Delicatessen in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Founded in 1988, we provide enough food for more than 15,000 meals a day to150 community programs serving our neighbors, mostly families and children, in need of food. More than 6,000 different volunteers donate their time to Food Gatherers annually. Volunteers account for almost 70% of all hours worked at Food Gatherers. Since 1988, Food Gatherers has distributed more than 54 million pounds of food throughout Washtenaw County.
