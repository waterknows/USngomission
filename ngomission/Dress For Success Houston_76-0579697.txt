Founded in 1998, Dress for Success Houston's purpose is to offer long-lasting solutions that enable women to break the cycle of poverty. Dress for Success Houston is part of a global movement for change, empowering women to obtain safer and better futures. We provide each client with professional attire to secure employment, but we are about much more than simply a new outfit. Besides physically equipping the client with apparel and accessories, our programs furnish her with a confidence that she carries forever and the knowledge that she can actively define her life, the direction she takes and what success means to her.
