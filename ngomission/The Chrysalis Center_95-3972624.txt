Chrysalis is a nonprofit organization dedicated to creating a pathway to self-sufficiency for homeless and low-income individuals by providing the resources and support needed to find and retain employment. Since our start in 1984, we have helped over 35,000 individuals change their lives through jobs. Chrysalis' three main service centers are located where homelessness and pockets of poverty are most pervasive: in Skid Row in Downtown Los Angeles, Santa Monica, and in the Pacoima area of the San Fernando Valley. We currently help over 3,500 people a year change their lives through jobs.
