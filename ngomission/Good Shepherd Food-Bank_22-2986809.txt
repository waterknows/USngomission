The mission of Good Shepherd Food Bank is to eliminate hunger in Maine by sourcing and distributing nutritious food to people in need, building strong community partnerships, and mobilizing the public in the fight to end hunger. Good Shepherd Food Bank relies on its relationships with Maine's food industry in order to gather millions of pounds of food each year. Additionally, we secure yet more truckloads for the state of Maine from national food donors through our affiliation with Feeding America.
