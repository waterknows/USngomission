From humble beginnings dating back to 1915, Phoenix Day has taken huge strides to be innovative and progressive in addressing the needs of early care and education, as well as supporting the comprehensive well being of the children we serve. Phoenix Day's HealthLinks Program provides our families with much-needed case management and assistance in enrolling in AHCCCS. Through the eligibility process, HealthLinks coordinators promote the availability of a variety of health resources available for our families. In addition, HealthLinks partners with ten community agencies to provide the same health-related services to over 500 families each year.
