Incorporated in 1970, the purpose of the Friends of the Rosamond Gifford Zoo at Burnet Park is to stimulate the interest of the public in the extension and improvement of the Rosamond Gifford Zoo at Burnet Park and, where possible, to assist in the expansion of zoo facilities. The mission of the Zoo itself is to conserve, exhibit and interpret a living animal collection in order to promote public recreation, understanding of the relationship between animals and people, and action to sustain the environment we share.
