One of the most celebrated art museums in the country, the Walker Art Center (WAC) is known for commissioning and presenting innovative contemporary art; fostering the cross-pollination of the visual, performing, and media arts; and engaging diverse audiences in the excitement of the creative process. Founded in 1879, WAC has evolved from a small-scale, primarily regional institution into a major local, national, and international artistic resource. A 17-acre urban campus, designed by Pritzker Prize-winning architects Herzog & de Meuron, opened in spring 2005. The expanded facility features new galleries; education areas; a new 385-seat theater; street-level and roof-top terraces; plazas, gardens, and lounges; and increased services and amenities for visitors.
