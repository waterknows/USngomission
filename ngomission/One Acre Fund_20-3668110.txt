One Acre Fund supplies smallholder farmers with the financing and training they need to grow their way out of hunger and poverty. Instead of giving handouts, we invest in smallholder farmers to generate a permanent gain in farm income. Through a model of asset-based financing that addresses the full value chain, we provide a complete service bundle of seeds and fertilizer, financing for farm inputs, agricultural training, and market facilitation--and we deliver these services within walking distance of the 300,000 rural farmers we serve in Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi and Tanzania.One Acre Fund measures success in our ability to make more farmers more prosperous. We only serve farmers, and we always put Farmers First.
