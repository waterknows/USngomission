Focus: HOPE, a civil and human rights organization founded in 1968, serves the community through a food program, education and training programs, and community and economic development initiatives. Its neighborhood revitalization efforts began in the 1970s as the organization converted abandoned industrial buildings into offices, a food center and education facilities. More than 41,000 mothers, children and senior citizens receive food each month from Focus: HOPE - and thousands of talented men and women have established careers after graduating from the education programs.
