United Way of Racine County has been helping local families since 1922. At United Way, we work to improve lives and create lasting community change in partnership with local organizations. Our focus is on education, income, and health because they are the building blocks for a successful life. We all benefit when a child succeeds in school, when individuals and families are financially stable, and when people are healthy.
