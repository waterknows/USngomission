The Ministry of Caring is committed to serving the ongoing needs of the poor: food for the hungry, shelter, transitional living, and permanent housing for the homeless, jobs for the unemployed, clothing and furniture for the needy, child care for homeless children, medical and dental services for the poor, and advocacy as well as outreach for the disenfranchised. It is our belief that the poor should never be served poorly, but with love, dignity and respect. All Ministry of Caring programs offer hospitality and friendship, while striving to meet basic needs, and help the poor attain self-sufficiency. We minister to the poor by offering them not only the necessities of life- food, shelter, and employment- but also by helping restore their sense of self worth and hope for the future.
