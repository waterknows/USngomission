Lazarus House Ministries is spiritually based and welcomes all in the name of God. We provide a continuum of care encompassing, but not limited to: shelter, food, clothing, advocacy, education, work preparation, health services, a listening ear, a welcoming heart, and the restoration of dignity and self-respect to people who are poor and in dire need. Although we are a faith-based ministry, we are not affiliated with any church. We serve to empower our guests to move beyond poverty and crisis and to become productive members of their community.
