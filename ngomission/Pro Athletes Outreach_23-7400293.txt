Pro Athletes Outreach (PAO) conducts Christ-centered programs and conferences to equip professional athletes, coaches and their families to make a positive impact in the world for Jesus Christ. Today's professional athletes have a tremendous platform to influence the world around them. Their lives are scrutinized by media, fans and the general public. We are committed to protecting the privacy of athletes, coaches and their families while they enjoy our conferences. Over the past 36 years, PAO has not only grown its ministry but has been an integral partner in starting ministries in various other sports. PAO's ministry expansion includes Motor Racing Outreach, Pro Basketball Fellowship, Jockey/Rodeo conference, Women's Getaway and more.
