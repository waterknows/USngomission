Since 1944 The Jimmie Hale Mission has been a shelter for the homeless, a rest stop for the weary, a feeding station for the hungry, and a sanctuary for the hurting. For many, the Mission has not been their last stop but the first step toward a changed life. Our purpose is to minister to the spiritual and physical needs of the poor and hurting in Jesus' name. It all began with Jimmie Hale, who used to be known as the town drunk. After becoming a Christian and sober, his desire was to have a Mission, which he founded with his wife. Since then the Jimmie Hale Mission has grown considerably. What started as a storefront chapel now includes: Jessie's Place, Royal Pines Center, Mission Possible Bargain Centers and the Shepura Men's Center.
