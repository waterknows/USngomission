At Crosstown Learning Center, we are proud of our excellent reputation for providing quality care in a creative learning environment. Our curriculum provides us opportunities to have on-going assessments of our children, through documentation; lesson planning that is geared specifically to the individual child and offers opportunities for parents to become involved in their child's learning. We are also offering parent education programs, which meet once a month to discuss parenting issues.
