Established in 1868, Oregon Humane Society (OHS) is the largest and oldest humane society in the Pacific Northwest, and the third oldest in the country. OHS fosters an environment of respect, responsibility, and compassion for all animals through education, legislation and leadership. We work to care for the homeless, to defend the abused, and to fight with unrelenting diligence for recognition of the integrity of all animals. We serve the needs of more than 11,000 animals each year. With 140 staff members and a volunteer force of more than 1,900, the Oregon Humane Society is dedicated to adopt 100 percent of the animals turned in to the shelter.
