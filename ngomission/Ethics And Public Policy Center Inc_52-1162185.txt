Founded in 1976, the Ethics and Public Policy Center (EPPC) is Washington, D.C.'s premier institute dedicated to applying the Judeo-Christian moral tradition to critical issues of public policy. From the Cold War to the war on terrorism, from disputes over the role of religion in public life to battles over the nature of the family, EPPC and its scholars have consistently sought to defend the great Western ethical imperatives - respect for the inherent dignity of the human person, individual freedom and responsibility, justice, the rule of law, and limited government. Through its core programs, EPPC and its scholars work to influence policymakers and to transform the culture through the world of ideas.
