JOIN was founded in 1992 in order to bridge the gap between homeless and housed members of the community. JOIN exists to support the efforts of homeless individuals and families to transition out of homelessness into permanent housing. Our efforts are directed at individuals sleeping outside or in their car in the Portland Metro area. Our service provision is grounded in an innovative blend of harm reduction and mutual relationships that emphasize strengths rather than deficits. Our operational priority is to rapidly re-house individuals and families and stabilize them in their new homes. Our services include outreach and engagement, housing retention, a basic services center, and immersion programs.
