Founded in 1986, the mission of the United Way of Douglas County is to address human service needs by mobilizing community resources and building partnerships. United Way of Douglas County's Center for Human Services provides a campus-like atmosphere for the 20 nonprofit organizations that occupy its low-cost offices. The organizations thrive by being able to share resources, office equipment, conference rooms, storage space, and information, and it is through this kind of collaboration that the United Way of Douglas County takes another step towards strengthening local human services.
