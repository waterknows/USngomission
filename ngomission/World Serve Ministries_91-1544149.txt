WorldServe Ministries specializes in transformational development, focused on serving the most vulnerable and needy, both physically and spiritually, with emphasis on China and Cuba. It empowers indigenous churches to advance the gospel and impact nations. We provide believers with practical ways to get involved with what God is doing around the world and rapidly deploy resources to hot spots around the world with the greatest response to the Gospel. WorldServe leverages our resources primarily through indigenous pastors and church planters for maximum impact for God's Kingdom.
