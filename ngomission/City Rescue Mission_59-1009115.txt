City Rescue Mission (CRM) was established in 1946 by a group of Christian businessmen who saw a need to help alcoholics in the Jacksonville, Florida area. Their goal at the time was to offer soup, soap and salvation. What has evolved over all these years is a privately funded organization whose mission is to rebuild the lives of the homeless and needy through life building programs and the love and compassion of Jesus Christ. City Rescue Mission provides food, clothing, shelter, emergency services and residential recovery programs to homeless men, women and women with children.Each year CRM serves approximately 300,000 meals and provides nearly 90,000 nights of shelter to those in need. Volunteer opportunities are available. CRM receives no local, state or federal government funding. We rely solely on individuals, foundations, and corporations for funding.
