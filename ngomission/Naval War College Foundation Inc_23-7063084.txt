The Naval War College Foundation was created in 1969 by forward-looking, community-minded individuals whose goals were to contribute to the educational excellence of the College. As the Foundation completes its 42nd year, its commitment to the College remains firm. The Foundation enriches and further enhances Naval War College programs as defense dollars diminish and the need for officers educated in international security affairs increases.
