In 1994 when the Maui Arts & Cultural Center (MACC) opened its doors, it was the culmination of a 30-year dream of Maui's people for: a place where the community could gather and celebrate together, a first-class venue where the world's most exciting artists could be enjoyed, and an excellent educational resource serving all ages. The MACC recognizes that people have an inherent need to create, that arts are meaningful expressions of cultures, and Hawaiian culture is vital to their identity. Each year there are approximately 1,735 events for the public to use and benefit from the MACC including community events, art exhibits, educational activities, church services, service club meetings, recitals, concerts and other performances.
