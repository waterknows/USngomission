Dakin Humane Society delivers effective, innovative services that improve the lives of animals in need and the people who care about them. Dakin is a private, non-profit organization serving the communities of Franklin, Hampshire and Hampden counties. Many of our programs also serve animals and people in Worcester and Berkshire counties, as well as northern Connecticut. The philosophy of Dakin Humane Society is as much about preventing animal homelessness as it is about providing homes. We believe that providing safe haven, while an important piece of our mission, is but one part of it.
