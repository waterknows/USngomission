Founded in 2000, Naples Botanical Garden works to connect people and plants through display, education, conservation and science. Our vision is to create a world-class tropical/subtropical paradise that combines delightful exotic cultivated gardens with beautifully restored natural habitats. The Garden works to be an exceptional venue for horticultural shows, traveling exhibitions, special community events and the performing arts.
