Founded in 1985, the mission of the National Caregiving Foundation is to meet both the direct and indirect needs resulting from the impact of catastrophic diseases on our society. The mission is accomplished by: disseminating educational information; distributing support materials that ease the burden of those affected by the diseases; and by increasing public awareness. The National Caregiving Foundation focuses its efforts on the Alzheimer's Project. The Alzheimer's Project is a national effort to assist caregivers of Alzheimer's patients. Alzheimer's disease is a progressive degenerative disease that attacks the brain and results in impaired memory, thinking and behavior. Alzheimer's not only attacks the affected person, but also the caregivers who pay a high physical and emotional price for their association with their loved one who falls victim to the disease.
