ZERO1 is a Silicon Valley arts organization. We connect creative explorers in art, science, and technology to provoke new ideas that shape a more resilient future. Working with some of the most fertile and creative minds from the worlds of art, science, design, architecture, and technology, ZERO1 produces the ZERO1 Biennial, an international showcase of work at the nexus of art and technology and the ZERO1 Fellowship program where principles of artistic creativity are applied to real world innovation challenges.
