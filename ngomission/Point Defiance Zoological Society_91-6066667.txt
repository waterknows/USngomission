The Point Defiance Zoological Society connects Point Defiance Zoo & Aquarium (PDZA) and our local and global communities, and mobilizes the community's time, talent and financial resources to enhance the zoo experience for visitors and animals. The Zoo Society supports PDZA and its efforts to promote responsible stewardship of the world's resources through education, conservation, research and recreational opportunities. The 29-acre zoological park is the second most popular tourist destination in Pierce County, attracting about 600,000 visitors a year. The Zoo sits within 700-acre Point Defiance Park, offering spectacular views of Mount Rainier, the Olympic Mountains and Puget Sound. The Zoo currently houses 792 animals from 98 different species.
