Founded in 1936, Children International is a humanitarian organization dedicated to improving the lives of impoverished children, their families and communities. We achieve our goals primarily through child sponsorship, which unites children in need with individual sponsors who wish to address the children's immediate and basic needs. Sponsorship gives poor children the tools and opportunities necessary for success by providing benefits and supporting programs for each child - primarily in the areas of education and health. Our sponsorship program currently benefits more than 335,000 impoverished children and their families in 11 countries throughout the world.
