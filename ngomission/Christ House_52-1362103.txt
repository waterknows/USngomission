Christ House is in its 25th year of providing comprehensive health care to sick, homeless men and women in Washington, DC. Our 34-bed facility provides 24-hour medical care, case management, housing placement assistance, meals, clothing, and a full range of other supportive services. Our goal is that patients will leave with improved health and a new ability to live independently in the community. We served 289 admissions in 2009 and provided a total of 9,009 patient-days of care. In addition to the primary illness(es) for which they were admitted, 90.5 percent of our patients acknowledged a history of alcohol or drug abuse, or had a diagnosed mental illness. Twenty-four percent had all three (alcohol, drug, and psychiatric concerns). Seventy-five percent of our patients in 2009 were African American males over the age of 50, and 31 percent were veterans of the armed forces. Nearly a third had no income and 64 percent had monthly income under $1,000.
