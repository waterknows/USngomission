Playworks believes in the power of play to bring out the best in every kid. This national organization provides safe, healthy, inclusive play and physical activity to schools at recess and throughout the entire school day. Founded in 1996, Playworks is the only nonprofit organization in the country to send trained, full-time adults, called "coaches" to low-income, urban schools. Directly and through training others, we create a place for every kid on the playground - a place where they belong, have fun and are part of the game. Playworks creates safe, inclusive school environments that allow kids to thrive. We currently serve more than 380 schools in 23 cities, and expect to reach nearly 425,000 students directly and through training services that reach hundreds of additional schools and community organizations.
