Pacific Environment protects the living environment of the Pacific Rim by promoting grassroots activism, strengthening communities and reforming international policies. We distribute at least a quarter of our annual budget to grassroots organizations on the frontlines of the environmental movement. We confront tax-payer funded banks that back oil, gas, mining and timber extraction and the companies that profit from these often environmentally-devastating projects. We support and encourage sustainable fishing, renewable energy and other initiatives that put environmental protection and communities first. We forge coalitions and partnerships with environmentalists and other community members around the Pacific Rim - building a united movement to deal with the global threats we face.
