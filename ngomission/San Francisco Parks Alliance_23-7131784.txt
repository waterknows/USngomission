MissionSan Francisco Parks Alliance's mission is to inspire and promote civic engagement and philanthropy to protect, sustain, and enrich San Francisco parks and green open spaces. The San Francisco Parks Alliance (SFPA) launched in October 2011, and combines San Francisco's two preeminent parks advocacy and support organizations, Neighborhood Parks Council (founded 1996) and San Francisco Parks Trust (founded 1971), to create a new, stronger, more effective voice for parks. SFPA brings together the best in advocacy and philanthropy, combining 55 years of experience toward a common goal-to engage citizens in improving their public spaces and providing healthy, safe recreation for all.
