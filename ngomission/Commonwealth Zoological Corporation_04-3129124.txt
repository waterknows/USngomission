Zoo New England's mission is to inspire people to protect and sustain the natural world for future generations by creating fun and engaging experiences that integrate wildlife and conservation programs, research, and education. Zoo New England operates Franklin Park Zoo in Boston and Stone Zoo in Stoneham, Massachusetts. Franklin Park Zoo is a 72-acre site nestled in Boston's historic Franklin Park, long considered the crown jewel of Frederick Law Olmsted's Emerald Necklace Park System. Stone Zoo, formerly known as the Middlesex Fells Zoo, is located on a 26-acre site near the sparkling Spot Pond reservoir in Stoneham, MA.
