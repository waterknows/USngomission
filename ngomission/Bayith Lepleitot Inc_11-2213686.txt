Bayith Lepleitot provides grants for the support of an orphan asylum in Israel by the same name. The orphanage was founded in 1949, soon after the Second World War, when the European holocaust refugees came pouring in, legally or illegally, to the shores of our Homeland. There was then a desperate need for a warm and understanding home for stranded, broken, orphaned children -- children whose parents were killed by Hitler, sometimes a single survivor of a family or a couple of an entire city. We now care for hundreds of children in three dormitory buildings: Bayith Lepleitot, in the heart of Jerusalem, a smaller building behind it, and Girls Town Jerusalem. The children there come from 32 different countries all over the world.
