Edgar Cayce's A.R.E (Association for Research and Enlightenment) was founded in 1931 by Edgar Cayce to research and explore transpersonal subjects such as holistic health, ancient mysteries, personal spirituality, dreams and dream interpretation, intuition, and philosophy and reincarnation. The Mission of A.R.E. is simply to help people change their lives for the better through the ideas and information in the Edgar Cayce material. Through its many programs, services, publication and membership outreach, the A.R.E. provides individuals from all walks of life, levels of education, and religious backgrounds with tools for personal empowerment and healing at all levels- body, mind, and spirit.
