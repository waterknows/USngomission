PeacePlayers International was founded in 2001 by brothers Sean and Brendan Tuohey on the premise that "children who play together can learn to live together." In its twelve years of operations, PPI has reached more than 60,000 participants and trained more than 800 youth leaders. Through a groundbreaking peacebuilding-and-leadership development curriculum, PeacePlayers International uses basketball to bring children together and teach them proven tactics for improving their communities. PeacePlayers International currently operates year-round programs in South Africa, Northern Ireland, Israel and the West Bank, and Cyprus. Additionally, through the PPI Sports and Peace Innovation Network (PPI-SPIN), a "train the trainer" program model, PPI is scaling impact in conflict areas around the globe.
