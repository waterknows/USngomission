Established by William Robertson Coe, Planting Fields Foundation preserves and interprets Planting Fields Arboretum State Historic Park as the premier public garden and Gold Coast estate for today and tomorrow by educating, enriching, and entertaining the visiting public. Since 1979, the Planting Fields Foundation has worked in partnership with the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation to staff, interpret, and preserve Coe Hall and the historic structures and landscape features throughout the former estate. The arboretum is comprised of over 409 acres of greenhouses, rolling lawns, formal gardens, woodland paths, and outstanding plant collections. Original historic estate buildings remain including the 65 room Tudor Revival mansion Coe Hall.
