Founded in 1942, Woman's Missionary Union, Auxiliary to South Carolina Baptist ConventionSM, exists to empower churches and believers to participate in the Great Commission. We exist to equip churches, especially its members--women and men, girls and boys and preschoolers--to discover and live out their missions call. We are available to equip churches in beginning and strengthening missions discipleship for all ages, preschool through adults, and with the churchwide audience.
