Liberty Youth Ranch is a long-term children's residential group home for Florida's orphaned, abused, abandoned, neglected, and homeless children, designed to ensure each child's education and eventual high school graduation with a strong emphasis being placed on the uniqueness and inherent worth of each child. Our mission is to provide a permanent and loving environment for children who through no fault of their own are in need of a home, a family, and the opportunity simply to be children. We base our concepts on a belief in God and the uniqueness, dignity, and inherent worth of each individual.
