The Jewish Federation of Chattanooga is one of 157 Federations under the umbrella of Jewish Federations of North America (JFNA). We are the central organization of the Chattanooga Jewish community, rooted in centuries of tradition and adapted to the patterns and practicalities of our American society. Our Annual Campaign allows us to provide extensive social services, to bring the community together for social, cultural, and educational programs, to operate a Jewish preschool, and to inform the community through a monthly newspaper. The Federation promotes cooperation among Jewish organizations to reduce and avoid duplication of services among agencies. We also represent the Jewish community in matters pertaining to religious freedom, and anti-Semitism.
