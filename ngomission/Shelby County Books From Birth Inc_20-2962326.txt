Books from Birth (BFB) promotes kindergarten readiness and strengthen family bonds in Shelby County by providing age-appropriate books for all children from birth to age five. As a part of a state-wide effort to bring the Imagination Library to all children in Tennessee, Books from Birth was formally organized in the summer of 2005 to cover Shelby County. Over that time, BfB has established itself as the largest of 1,600 programs affiliated with the Imagination Library. Books from Birth continues to provide the Imagination Library as its core service, though general advocacy about the importance of early literacy is a major emphasis as well.
