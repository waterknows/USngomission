The Jewish Federation of Broward County (formerly The United Jewish Community of Broward County) raises funds to support the crucial work of 30 social and humanitarian agencies that help Jews in need in our own community, in Israel, and around the world. Here in Broward County, our local beneficiary agencies touch the lives of thousands of people each and every day. They provide support and services for Jews of all ages, all interests, all incomes, and all backgrounds. Through our Jewish community centers our young learn all about Judaism and the basics of their people's traditions; and adults, singles and families can enjoy a wonderful array of social, cultural, educational and recreational programs.
