International Orthodox Christian Charities, Inc. (IOCC) was established in 1992 as the official humanitarian relief agency of the

Assembly of Canonical Orthodox Bishops of he United States of America. The mission of IOCC is to offer emergency relief and development programs to those in need worldwide, without discrimination, and strengthen the capacity of the Orthodox Church to so respond. In seeking to provide assistance to the poor, either in response to emergencies or long term socio-economic development needs, IOCC's fundamental policy is to develop a sustainable indigenous capacity to carry out such programs. All programs are guided by the two goals of program integrity and the highest standards of stewardship to donors.
