United Way of Brazoria County raises funds through public contributions and distributes those funds to various charitable organizations. There are three basic things we all need for a good life: A quality education, an income that can support a family, and good health. Over the next ten years, we aim to: cut by half the number of young people who drop out of high school; cut by half the number of lower-income families that lack financial stability; and increase by one third the number of youths and adults who are healthy and avoid risky behaviors.
