Baylor School was established in 1893 as a college preparatory school for the young men of Chattanooga. Today, Baylor enrolls students in grades 6-12. Our boarding program draws students from around the country and the world, who are attracted to the school by a strong academic program, diverse extracurricular activities, and a nurturing residential atmosphere. Baylor's mission is to foster in its students both the ability and the desire to make a positive difference in the world. Baylor fulfills its mission by providing: a rich academic program; a school rooted in tradition yet receptive to change; a wide variety of co-curricular experiences; a diverse academy having at its heart a vibrant resident community of faculty and students from around the world; and a balance of emphases on activities of the mind, body, and spirit.
