The Sheriffs' Association of Texas is one of the oldest law enforcement associations in the nation. The Sheriffs' Association of Texas met for the first time on August 14, 1874, in the courthouse in Corsicana, Navarro County, Texas. The Sheriffs began annual training conferences in 1878. These training conferences today are the largest composite gathering of law enforcement officers in Texas. Sheriffs and other county and local law enforcement officers, federal and state officers, and major industry security personnel attend. The Association provides law enforcement promotion and education to the general public and those involved directly with public safety and law enforcement.
