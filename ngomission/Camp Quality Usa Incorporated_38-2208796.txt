Camp Quality serves children with cancer and their families by providing year-round programs, experiences, and companionship, at no cost. Camp Quality promotes hope and inspiration while helping children foster life skills and develop their full potential.In the USA, there are presently 15 camps established in 11 states. More than 900 children participate in our camps each summer, and many more participate in Camp Quality activities throughout the year. More than 10,000 children are diagnosed with cancer every year. Countless numbers of families struggle with the physical, emotional and financial challenges of this disease. To make matters worse, the cause of childhood cancer is largely unknown, making successful treatment a challenge, current research necessary and an established support system imperative.
