Virginia Legal Aid Society (VLAS) was established in 1977 to provide free civil legal services to eligible low-income residents in twenty counties and six cities in Central, Southside, and Western Tidewater Virginia. VLAS serves the entire community by providing free information, advice and representation in such areas as housing, healthcare, income and benefits, family issues, consumer, and education.
