The Kaufman Music Center has roots dating back to 1952 when the Lucy Moses School was founded. The Kaufman Music Center brings together music education and performance for students and audiences of all ages, backgrounds, and skill levels, combining the finest music education for children and adults with boldly innovative yet intimate concert experiences spanning a wide range of music. All three of the Kaufman Music Center's divisions - Merkin Concert Hall, Lucy Moses School and Special Music School - are housed in the Goodman House on West 67th Street in Manhattan. Today, more than 75,000 music and arts lovers use the Goodman House annually.
