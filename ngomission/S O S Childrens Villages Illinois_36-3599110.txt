Established in 1993, SOS Children's Villages Illinois provides a stable home in a supportive, community environment designed to help children in need grow into caring, productive, self-reliant adults. SOS provides a viable alternative to traditional foster care. Children who come to live at SOS stay with their biological brothers and sisters in a private home. A full-time, professionally trained foster parent lives with them, and the whole Village gives them support, compassion and strength. At SOS, we help children whose world has been turned upside down by parental abuse, neglect, or abandonment. We offer them a place to call home and space to heal. By keeping brothers and sisters together, with a full time professional foster parent in an individual home, we rebuild a loving family life.
