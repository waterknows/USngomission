Donna Klein Jewish Academy (DKJA) works to educate children and the greater community to be knowledgeable and responsible citizens of the world, committed to Jewish values and lifelong learning. DKJA's core values are: respect, good character, excellence in teaching and learning, Jewish values/identity, and a nurturing environment. Since its inception in 1979, the academy has grown to be one of the largest community Jewish day schools in the United States, and one of the very few kindergarten through grade twelve schools, with an international reputation for educational excellence and innovation in both general and Judaic studies.
