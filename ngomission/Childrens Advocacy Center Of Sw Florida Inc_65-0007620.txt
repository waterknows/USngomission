 Since 1981, Children's Advocacy Center of Southwest Florida, Inc. (CAC) has advocated for a healthy, safe community for children through a multidisciplinary team approach to child abuse and neglect. Our mission is to assess and treat kids believed to have been physically or sexually abused or to be "at-risk" of such abuse, and to provide a safe place for them to come and be heard. We offer abuse determination services, as well as therapeutic counseling, parenting education, and prevention programs in Lee, Hendry, Glades, and Charlotte Counties.  We are the only children's advocacy center in the four-county area accredited by the National Children's Alliance, and the largest children's advocacy center in the state of Florida. In 2013, we treated over 5,000 children and their families.
