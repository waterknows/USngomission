The purpose of BEE World is to help the Church fulfill the Great Commission by providing biblical training that results in the multiplication of servant leaders, with priority given to countries with limited access to training. BEE (Biblical Education by Extension) World provides comprehensive, interactive Bible education and training for pastors and leaders of the persecuted church and in other places where Christians find it difficult to obtain a seminary or Bible school education.
