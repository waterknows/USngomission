Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) is a national alliance of local state and federal resource professionals, law enforcement officers, land managers, and other professionals dedicated to upholding environmental laws and values. We organize a broad base of among employees within local, state, and federal resource management agencies. We monitor these agencies by serving as a watch dog for the public interest and inform the administration, congress, other officials, media, and the public about substantive environmental issues. We defend and strengthen the legal rights of public employees who speak out about issues concerning natural resource management and environmental protection, providing free legal assistance when necessary.
