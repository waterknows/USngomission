Global Communities is an international non-profit organization that works closely with communities worldwide to bring about sustainable changes that improve the lives and livelihoods of the vulnerable. Development is not something we do for people; it is something we do with them. We believe that the people who understand their needs best are the people of the community itself.We make a difference by engaging with communities, governments, the private sector and NGOs as partners for good - bringing together complementary strengths and shared responsibilities to work toward common goals. We envision a world where everyone has the freedom, means and ability to live and prosper with dignity.Global Communities has existed for 60 years. Most recently we have been known as CHF International and, before that, the Cooperative Housing Foundation. We began in 1952 as the Foundation for Cooperative Housing.
