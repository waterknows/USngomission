The American Society of Transplantation was founded in 1982 and is an organization of more than 3400 professionals dedicated to advancing the field of transplantation and improving patient care by promoting research, education, advocacy, and organ donation. Uniquely in modern medicine, solid organ donation and transplantation requires interaction among multiple parties, well beyond the usual patient-provider relationship. For instance, availability of organs influences decision-making in patient care for all involved.
