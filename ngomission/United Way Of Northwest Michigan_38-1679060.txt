United Way of Northwest Michigan believes that to truly improve lives in our region we must act collectively to impact the critical issues affecting residents of Antrim, Benzie, Grand Traverse, Kalkaska, and Leelanau counties. We are committed to bringing together partners across all sectors in order to address community concerns before they become problems. In so doing, we create sustainable community change. Our mission is to efficiently raise and effectively distribute both financial and volunteer resources to support community-determined initiatives that improve the lives of community members.
