Founded in 1976, The Virginia Museum of Fine Arts Foundation raises funds and manages investments for the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts (VMFA), an agency of the Commonwealth of Virginia. VMFA has achieved an international reputation for creative excellence and innovative programming. The Museum houses a collection of world art ranging from antiquities to contemporary art, preserved as records of the best of human expression. Each year, hundreds of thousands of people are enriched by experiences visiting the Museum, going online for virtual website tours and interactive activities, participating in educational programs and social events, or attending traveling exhibitions, lectures, and workshops at one of our statewide partner venues. VMFA is currently undergoing construction and will re-open on May 1, 2010.
