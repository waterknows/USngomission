In 2004, Sixth & I opened its doors as a place where people, especially those in their twenties and thirties, could connect to Judaism, arts, and culture both religiously and socially. At Sixth & I, what it means to be Jewish is up to you. With a multi-denominational and non-membership approach, we are an ongoing experiment in creating a uniquely Jewish experience, where identity and community intersect on your terms. Sixth & I introduces young professionals and Jews of all ages to an unconventional, inclusive model of 21st-century Jewish life.
