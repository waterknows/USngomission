Camp Smile-A-Mile (Camp SAM) was founded in 1985. Our mission today is to provide year round challenging, unforgettable recreational and educational experiences for young cancer patients, their families as well as young adult survivors from Alabama at no cost. Our purpose is to provide these patients, families and survivors with avenues for fellowship, to help them cope with their disease, and to prepare them for life after cancer. Camp SAM serves more than 400 children and young adults each year. Our programs include the following activities: family camp weekends, week-long camp sessions, sibling camp weekend, off therapy family camp weekend, young adult retreat, monthly activities, and teen trips.
