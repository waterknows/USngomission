Asheville Humane Society was formed in 1984 as Buncombe County Friends for Animals Inc., primarily as a governing body for the County Pet Adoption Center and Animal Shelter, which was previously operated by the County. Asheville Humane Society has operated the Shelter since September 1990. In September 2010, Asheville Humane Society, in partnership with Buncombe County, opened the Animal Care Campus. The campus comprises two facilities: Asheville Humane Society Adoption and Education Center and the Buncombe County Animal Shelter. The two facilities sit side by side and work in tandem in a public-private partnership that serves as a national model for other communities hoping to work collaboratively on eradicating animal homelessness.
