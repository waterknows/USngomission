Founded in 1988, the ALS Association Connecticut Chapter helps people living with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and leaves no stone unturned in search for the cure. We work together with the National Office of the ALS Association to accomplish our mission. The Connecticut Chapter focuses primarily on helping local patients and families live with ALS while the National Office focuses primarily on research and advocacy. The Chapter supports the National Office through revenue sharing and research contributions. The National Office supports the Chapters by providing up-to-date information and materials.
