Founded in 1983, East Tennessee PBS exists to serve the needs of East Tennessee as a community partner affecting positive change by educating, entertaining and challenging minds. As a viewer-supported television station and PBS member station, we provide lifelong learning opportunities to more than 1 million viewers in East Tennessee, Southern Kentucky, Southeast Virginia and Western North Carolina. We achieve this by broadcasting non-violent, commercial-free children's series; instructional programs; and primetime shows that educate, entertain, inform and inspire.
