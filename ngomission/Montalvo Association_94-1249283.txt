Montalvo Arts Center is an oasis of culture and nature that fulfills its mission by creating and presenting arts of all types, by nurturing artists, and by using our historic Villa, buildings and grounds in innovative ways that engage people in the creative process. Nearly 200k people enjoy Montalvo's programs annually, including year-round concerts and gallery exhibitions that draw a wide variety of music and contemporary art lovers. Our Education Program, which enables students and teachers to work directly with renowned professional artists, serves 20,000 K-12 students each year, many of whom come from low-income backgrounds. The Sally and Don Lucas Artists Residency Program is committed to connecting local, national & international artists-in-residence with the community. In advance of each residency, we work with artists to plan education and outreach activities, which may include performances, exhibitions, lectures, commissioned projects, as well as master classes for youth.
