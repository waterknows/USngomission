The mission of the French Institute Alliance Française (FIAF) is to promote and enhance the knowledge and appreciation of French and Francophone culture, to increase the knowledge of the French language, and to encourage interaction among French, Francophone and American people through programs in education and the arts. Founded at the turn of the 20th century, the French Institute and the Alliance Française de New York operated as two separate organizations. In 1971 they merged to form what has become one of the largest and most respected centers of French-American activities in the United States.
