With roots dating back to 1929, the United Way of Palm Beach County was formed via a merger of four separate organizations in 1992. The mission of the United Way of Palm Beach County is to improve measurably the lives of individuals and families in Palm Beach County by uniting the resources of donors, volunteers, agencies and the community. Focusing on what matters most has helped United Way become the nation's leading community solutions partner. Through our local community impact agenda, we are producing measurable results through the following impact areas: providing food, shelter and emergency needs; improving futures for children and families; promoting independence for people with disabilities; and improving the lives of seniors.
