Outreach was created in 2004 when the founders, Floyd Hammer and Kathy Hamilton, returned from a trip to Tanzania on a construction mission. During that trip they experienced the death of many children from hunger and related diseases. Outreach provides safe water, food, medical care and education to children and those in need at home and abroad.
