Habitat for Humanity International began as an idea on Koinonia Farm in Americus, Georgia in the 1960s by Millard and Linda Fuller, and was formerly founded in 1976 as a Christian ministry dedicated to the elimination of poverty housing worldwide. Indian River Habitat for Humanity became an affiliate in September 1991. Since that time, Indian River Habitat has built more than 280 homes throughout the county, from Fellsmere in the north to the Oslo Park area in the south county.
