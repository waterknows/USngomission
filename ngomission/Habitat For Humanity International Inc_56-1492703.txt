Habitat for Humanity of Wake County has since 1985 joined with individuals and local organizations to build simple, decent, affordable homes in partnership with families living at modest income levels who cannot qualify for mortgages at market rates. Habitat for Humanity helps people build and buy their own homes. It works by creating opportunity, not dependency. Habitat for Humanity of Wake County develops partnerships to build healthy, affordable homes with and for God's people in need, promotes self-reliance through homeownership, affirms the dignity of family, and creates sustainable communities.
