In 1953, the Greater Gastonia United Fund was chartered as a non-profit organization with eleven participating agencies. The name United Way of Gaston County was adopted by the Board of Directors on June 21, 1972. Our mission is to unite our community to help and care for one another. With more than 50 programs and 22 Partner Agencies, our priority funding areas are education, income and health.
