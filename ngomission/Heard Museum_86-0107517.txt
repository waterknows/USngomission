Opened in 1929, the Heard Museum works to educate the public about the heritage and living cultures and arts of Native peoples, with an emphasis on the peoples of the Southwest. Since its founding as a small museum in a small southwestern town, the Heard has grown in size and stature to where now it is recognized internationally for the quality of its collections, its educational programming and its festivals. The Heard is a living museum - giving voice to a uniquely American people. Through innovative programs, world-class exhibitions and unmatched festivals, the Heard Museum sets the standard nationally for collaborating with Native people to present first-person voices. Partnerships with American Indian artists and tribal communities provide visitors with a distinctive perspective about the art and cultures of Native people, especially those from the Southwest.
