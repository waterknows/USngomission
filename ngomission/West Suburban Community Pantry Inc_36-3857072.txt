Founded in 1992, the West Suburban Community Pantry offers food for the hungry and resources to empower persons to improve their quality of life. Our vision is to eradicate hunger within the families and individuals in the DuPage County area. We are dedicated to providing food for the hungry, educating the donor community about existing needs, and supporting advocacy efforts for the hungry. We also work hard to encourage volunteerism and the sharing of resources.
