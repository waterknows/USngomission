Founded in 1989, the mission of the Golden Spread Council is to serve today's youth and aid them in their endeavors to be prepared to face the challenges and opportunities of life, by instilling values through Scouting that will last for a lifetime. Our purpose is to provide strong, values-based programs that strengthen character, develop good citizenship, and enhance both mental and physical fitness. Our objective is to accomplish the mission of the BSA and provide Scouting values to the maximum number of youth in every community we serve.
