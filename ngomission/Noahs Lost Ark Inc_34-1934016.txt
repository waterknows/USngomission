Noah's Lost Ark is committed to educating people everywhere of the escalating epidemic of neglected, abused and unwanted exotic animals. By model of bestowing safe havens for mistreated exotic animals, along with educational programs, Noah's Lost Ark is instilling compassion, respect and responsibility towards the preservation and conservation of all animals, ultimately safeguarding the natural environment for future generations. Our facility is dedicated to providing a permanent safe haven for unwanted and abused exotic animals. We are a no-kill facility that allows these magnificent animals the opportunity to live out the rest of their lives in a safe and caring environment.
