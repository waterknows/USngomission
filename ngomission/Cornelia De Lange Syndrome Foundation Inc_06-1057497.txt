Founded in 1981, The Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS) Foundation is a family support organization which exists to ensure early and accurate diagnosis of CdLS, promote research into the causes and manifestations of the syndrome, and help people with a diagnosis of CdLS, and others with similar characteristics, make informed decisions throughout their lifetime. The Foundation provides a host of services that attract, educate, and unite families touched by this rare birth disorder which causes individuals to develop at a slower rate, both physically and mentally. CdLS is a congenital syndrome, and individuals affected have common characteristics such as: low birth weight, slow growth and small stature, small head size, and limb differences.
