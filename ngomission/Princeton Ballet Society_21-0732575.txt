Audr√©e and Bud Estey founded the Princeton Ballet Society (d.b.a. American Repertory Ballet) in 1954. The Society's mission is:

 To bring the joy, beauty, artistry and discipline of classical and contemporary dance to New Jersey and nationwide audiences through public performances and to dance students through artistic and educational programs.



This mission is fulfilled through: American Repertory Ballet-a preeminent classical and contemporary ballet company, Princeton Ballet School - one of the largest non-profit dance schools in the nation, and ARB's Access and Enrichment (formerly called Education and Outreach) initiatives - including the long running and acclaimed DANCE POWER program.
