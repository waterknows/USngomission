Founded in 1980, Renewal Ministries is dedicated to fostering renewal and evangelization in the Catholic Church by helping people know the personal love of God in Jesus and grow in holiness. We seek to proclaim Christ in the power of the Holy Spirit through our weekly television program, The Choices We Face, our daily radio programs, Food for the Journey and Fire on the Earth; through parish missions, seminars and conferences, books, tapes, CDs, and videos, and through mission work in more than 25 countries. Our aim is to strengthen and equip Catholics for evangelization and ministry in the power of the Holy Spirit.
