Scottsdale League for the Arts (SLA) is a volunteer organization of accomplished men and women who support artists, arts programs and arts education through fundraising and special events. In order to offer continuous value and assistance to the arts, the League awards all net funds raised to a variety of arts focused organizations through a grants program. The SLA was originally formed in 1978 as the Men's League of the Scottsdale Center for the Performing Arts with a mission to raise funds for capital improvements to the Performing Arts Center.
