Visalia Rescue Mission (VRM) is a faith-based nonprofit organization that has been serving Visalia and the surrounding community since 1981. It was created as an overnight shelter and soup kitchen for the homeless population in Visalia, but has since grown to support the greater Central Valley. The services offered have also extended beyond meals and shelter. Visalia Rescue Mission now offers a residential Life Change Academy for men and women, in addition to overnight shelters, community meals and storage for the homeless. VRM currently serves over 300 meals daily in its community kitchen, and houses an average of 120 men and women on its properties nightly. Visalia Rescue Mission exists to provide programs, support and resources to combat homelessness, drug and alcohol addiction, and unemployment so individuals can become thriving members of the community. VRM's mission is for these individuals to ultimately find hope and restoration through Jesus Christ.
