The mission of Sea Research Foundation, which includes Mystic Aquarium, Institute for Exploration and Immersion Learning, is to inspire people to care for and protect our ocean planet through education, research and exploration. Our activities include education, research, exhibitry, deep-sea exploration and preservation, conservation, and institutional leadership. Established in 1977, Sea Research Foundation creates thought-provoking encounters with marine life, presents elements of human history as it relates to the sea, promotes the emerging science of deep-water marine archaeology, conducts research that advances aquatic animal husbandry and health, and serves as an interpreter of marine science discoveries and conservation issues.
