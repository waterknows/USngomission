Our service matches children from primarily one-parent households, with adult volunteers. The mentors and the children come from all walks of life. Prospective volunteers, who usually commit to an hour a week for abut a year, are carefully evaluated by agency staff. Each match is based on the needs of the child and the interests of both the child and the volunteer. Once a match is made, professional caseworkers are there to provide advice and support to help the match grow.
