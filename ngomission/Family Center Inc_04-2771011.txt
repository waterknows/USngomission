Founded in 1982, The Parenting Journey creates safer, more resilient families by supporting them in developing the inner strengths, life skills, and networks of resources they need to succeed. The Parenting Journey's approach is based on the family systems principle - that people do not exist in isolation. They live in families (however defined) and gain important strengths from these relationships. Through recognizing and harnessing families' strengths, our programs create changes that benefit all members, both individually and as a family.
