The mission of the National Book Foundation and the National Book Awards is to celebrate the best of American literature, to expand its audience, and to enhance the cultural value of good writing in America. Our BookUp program is an after-school program designed to motivate young people to stay involved with books and reading for pleasure throughout their middle-school years, with the hope they will develop into lifelong readers. The program introduces activities that emphasize reading as both fun and interactive. We have chosen to focus on middle-school students because studies show that this is the age when children are most at risk to stop reading.
