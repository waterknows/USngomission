Hope Cottage Pregnancy and Adoption Center is the oldest non-sectarian, nonprofit adoption center in Dallas. It began in 1918 with the vision of one woman, Emma Wylie Ballard, who recognized a need to provide care for Dallas's unwanted children. Hope Cottage nurtures and builds families through education, counseling and adoption services. The vision of Hope Cottage is to: be the preeminent resource whose services enable every child to have a family; children, women and families to thrive; every adoptive family to be educated and prepared; women in crisis pregnancies to make informed decisions, and; our community to embrace all families.
