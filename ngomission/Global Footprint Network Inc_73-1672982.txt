In 2003, Global Footprint Network was established to enable a sustainable future where all people have the opportunity to live satisfying lives within the means of one planet. Creating a world where everyone can live well, within the means of one planet, is going to take all of us pulling together toward this common goal. At Global Footprint Network, our programs are designed to influence decision makers at all levels of society and to create a critical mass of powerful institutions using the Footprint to put an end to ecological overshoot and get our economies back into balance.
