Founded in 1988, Bridges reaches out to the homeless in New York City, Newark, Irvington, and Summit, New Jersey every week. . On a typical Run, our truck is loaded with fresh, ready-to-eat meals in bags, sustainable lunches (long shelf life provisions), and soup, among other items of necessity, for those living on the street or in dire need. Our volunteers share conversation and bridge the gap between the housed and the homeless. Today, in addition to our street outreach, we provide case management services at St. John's Soup Kitchen in Newark, open our doors to Summit Neighbors in Need every Friday, and provide new backpacks and school supplies for more than 1,000 children eligible for free and reduced lunch in Summit and to sheltered children in Newark and Irvington.
