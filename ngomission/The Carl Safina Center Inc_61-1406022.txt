Founded in 2003, Blue Ocean Institute is the only conservation organization that uses science, art, and literature to inspire a closer bond with nature, especially the sea. We translate scientific information into language people can understand and use to make better choices on behalf of the sea. Whether you're a fisherman, seafood lover, student, faith leader, parent, artist, or chef, our programs help you learn how and why you should protect our planet's life-giving ocean. Blue Ocean Institute developed the first comprehensive seafood analysis and ranking methodology with our Guide to Ocean Friendly Seafood, including color-coded rankings for popular seafood and health advisory information.
