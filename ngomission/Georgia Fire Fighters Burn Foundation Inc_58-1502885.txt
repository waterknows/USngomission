Founded in 1982 by a group of DeKalb area firefighters, the Georgia Firefighters Burn Foundation's goal is to help burn survivors in their journey of recovery as well as prevent others from experiencing the traumatic event of a burn injury. The organization's mission is to partner with the fire service and burn care community to provide fire safety and prevention education, support medical facilities and assist burn survivors in their recovery.
