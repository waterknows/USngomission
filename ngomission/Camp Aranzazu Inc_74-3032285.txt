Camp Aranzazu is dedicated to enriching the lives of children and adults with chronic illnesses and special needs by providing unique camping, environmental studies, and retreat experiences to groups with special needs. The camp seeks to create and maintain a partnership between the campers and the land that preserves and protects the existing habitat for native and endangered species of plants and animals, and complements the history of the area and local community. Campers balance academic skill building with camping activities to regain confidence, relax, and have fun. General camping experiences teach children and adults with disabilities how they fit into society and how they can focus on what they can do, instead of what they cannot do. Camp Aranzazu serves 42 Texas counties that include the Houston area, extending west to San Antonio and south to the southernmost tip of the state.
