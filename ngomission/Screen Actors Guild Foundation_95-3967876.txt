Founded in 1985, the Screen Actors Guild Foundation is an educational, humanitarian and philanthropic organization. The Screen Actors Guild Foundation provides vital assistance and educational programming to the professionals of SAG-AFTRA while serving the public at large through its signature children's literacy programs. Our programs reflect the concerns and interests of SAG-AFTRA members as well as their desire to "give back" to their communities. The SAG Foundation is independent from SAG-AFTRA but offers substantive services to fully paid up, active SAG-AFTRA members, free of charge. The Foundation relies solely on the support from grants, corporate sponsorships, bequests and individual contributions to maintain our programs and create new ones.
