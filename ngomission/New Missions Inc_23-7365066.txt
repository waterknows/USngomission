Since 1983, New Missions has served in Haiti. Pastor George and Jeanne DeTellis arrived in Haiti in 1983 with whatever they could carry on the plane. They lived in a tent for three months while they built their first building. They started a church the first Sunday they were there. Now, 30 years later, New Missions has 28 churches in Haiti, and has over 10,000 children attending school.
