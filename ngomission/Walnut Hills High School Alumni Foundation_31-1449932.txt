Walnut Hills High School, a classical six-year college preparatory high school, is dedicated to the pursuit of academic excellence in a culturally diverse community. Academic ability, a respect for learning, and a will to achieve are tools for the student body and faculty alike. Analytical and creative thinking skills equip students to draw upon the knowledge of the past, to weigh the questions of the present, and to envision the possibilities of the future. Involvement in extra-curricular and co-curricular activities provides additional opportunities for pursuing intellectual, social, and athletic goals. We believe that intellectual achievement is intrinsically valuable in a democratic atmosphere of mutual respect, social equality, and personal responsibility.
