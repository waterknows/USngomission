Planned Parenthood of the Southern Finger Lakes is a nonprofit family planning agency that provides high-quality, affordable reproductive and sexual health care for people across our region. Many of our patients have no other health care available to them. PPSFL promotes sexual and reproductive health by providing exceptional services, honest education, and fearless advocacy. We believe that all people have the right to reproductive and sexual health care that is high quality, affordable, accessible, compassionate, and nonjudgmental. We believe that sexuality is central to being fully human and that all people have the right and the capacity to make informed, responsible decisions for themselves about sex and reproduction. We believe that people make the most responsible and healthy sexual decisions when they are supported by health care and sexuality education that is positive and not driven by fear.
