Boys & Girls Clubs of Central Mississippi provides a safe place to learn and grow through life enhancing programs while building ongoing, healthy relationships with caring adults and peers. Since 1936, the Boys & Girls Clubs of Central Mississippi has been the leading youth development organization in the region. Annually, we serve about 2,200 youth who spend nearly 750,000 hours at our 4 Metro-area clubs and our camp near Hazlehurst. Today, thousands of boys and girls, at-risk and in need, are taking advantage of the programs, activities, and services provided by the Boys & Girls Clubs of Central Mississippi. They benefit from trained, caring, professional staff and volunteers who help young people take control of their lives, envision productive futures and reach their goals.
