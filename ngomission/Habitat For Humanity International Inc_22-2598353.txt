Paterson Habitat for Humanity is the Passaic County affiliate for Habitat For Humanity. We build houses in partnership with lower income families in attempt to end poverty housing. We have been building houses in Paterson for 22 years. Families buy their houses from Habitat after completing the sweat equity hours, homeowner training requirements and paying 1% of the purchase price along with closing costs. The houses are sold at no profit, and Habitat finances a zero-interest mortgage.
