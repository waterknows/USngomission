Griffin Pond Animal Shelter was established as the Humane Society of Lackawanna County in 1938 to provide shelter for homeless, unwanted, and abused animals. Our charitable organization is a registered non-profit 501(c)3 serving Lackawanna and Wyoming Counties. Griffin Pond is the only animal shelter in Lackawanna County. Our Mission is to investigate, help prosecute and prevent cruelty to animals; promote adoption awareness, humane education and responsible pet ownership while we care for the many animals surrendered to our shelter to the best of our ability every day until we find them new loving homes.
