Founded in 2007, ASDF helps meet the needs of children and families affected by autism. The cost of services, treatment and care for a child affected by autism take a heavy toll on a family's budget. Families make great sacrifices and often compromise and prioritize basic family needs to provide their children with the therapies, schooling and medical treatment necessary to improve their quality of life. There are an abundance of resources on autism trends, treatments and research available, but the financial burdens autism families face tend to get overlooked. ASDF works with families and autism-specific organizations to take some of the financial burden off their shoulders. By providing funding for various programs that benefit an autistic child's specific needs, ASDF lets families know they are not alone in their efforts and gives them hope for the future.
