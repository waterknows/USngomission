The Retired Enlisted Association Memorial Foundation (TREA Memorial Foundation) was established in 1990 to support and assist fellow veterans, active and retired, their families, military widows and children as necessary to provide assistance during their time of need. The Memorial Foundation has the following programs which provide assistance for veterans and their families: scholarships for the children, grandchildren and great grandchildren of TREA and TREA Auxiliary members; benevolent assistance for families of veterans who are faced with adversity; and disaster relief assistance for victims of disasters who may be left homeless or in financial despair as a result of natural disasters. In January 2005, the Foundation started a new program, AFAC, in support of a military person or their dependents in need of help as a result of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.
