Founded in 2000 by philanthropist and Holocaust survivor, Henri Landwirth, Dignity U Wear works to positively impact the lives of children and their families by providing brand new clothing. Henri Landwirth founded the organization to create real change in the lives of children and adults in need, change that restores broken spirits and restores hope, dignity and self-esteem. To accomplish this change, Dignity U Wear creates primary partnerships with key manufacturers and retailers who provide new clothing. Dignity has streamlined our services to be incredibly efficient and thoughtful about each clothing distribution, providing the right clothes at the right time.  We provide clothes to homeless and wounded veterans, school children, and women in crisis. Through a number of annual campaigns and programs, including "Suits for Soldiers", "UNDIE", and "Learning with Dignity," we procure clothing for interviews, the classroom, and getting back on your feet after a personal crisis.
