Founded in 2004, the mission of the Youth Empowerment Project (YEP) is to provide intensive case management, mentoring and educational services to at-risk New Orleans youth. We will strengthen each young person's capacity to successfully connect with his or her family and community and lay the foundation for a healthy transition to adulthood. Since its inception, YEP has earned local and statewide recognition for being at the cutting edge of progressive programs for at-risk youth. We started as the first-of-its-kind re-entry program for juvenile offenders in Louisiana and now we are the region's most comprehensive and established agency working with at-risk, court-involved and out-of-school youth.
