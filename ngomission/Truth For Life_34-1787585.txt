Truth For Life's (TFL) mission is to teach the Bible with clarity and relevance so that unbelievers will be converted; believers will be established; and local churches will be strengthened. Truth For Life produces and airs the Bible-teaching sermons of Alistair Begg, seeking to faithfully proclaim the Word of God. Since 1995, Truth For Life continues its mission on the radio, online and in print. Every day, we release a new Bible-teaching message on over 1,700 radio outlets around the world and through our website, mobile apps, and daily podcast. A large content archive is available on our website, where listeners can download free messages or purchase CDs and DVDs of Alistair Begg's sermons. Printed publications, authored by Alistair Begg, address a variety of life's challenges, yet always point back to the authority and truth of God's Word. Truth For Life also connects with listeners at live ministry events and conferences across the US in cities where the radio program is heard.
