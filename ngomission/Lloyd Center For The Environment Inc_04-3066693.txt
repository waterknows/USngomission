The mission of the Lloyd Center for the Environment is to instill a life-long respect and affection for nature in citizens of all ages, through research and education; to advance a scientific and public understanding of our coastal ecosystems and the need to protect them; and to promote a legacy of natural diversity, largely in, but not restricted to, the coastal environments of southeastern New England.
