Founded in 1996, the Family Health Partnership Clinic works to improve the health status of the community and reduce the negative impact of poor access to care by providing a broad spectrum of services to the underserved with compassion and respect. We recognize that as a community, we are responsible for each other. We provide primary care services to uninsured and under-insured residents of McHenry County.
