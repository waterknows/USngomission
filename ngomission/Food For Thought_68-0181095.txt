Located in Forestville, California, Food For Thought is a grassroots organization dedicated to meeting the nutritional needs of persons living with or affected by AIDS/HIV disease in Sonoma County. The organization was founded in 1988. Since that time, we have provided free weekly grocery bags of canned and boxed food, fresh produce, nutritional supplements, vitamins, and whatever other goodies are on hand, along with frozen meals for people severely affected by AIDS. We currently provide food to more than 645 people, including men, women, and dependent children of parents with HIV/AIDS.
