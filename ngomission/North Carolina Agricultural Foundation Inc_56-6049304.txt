The North Carolina Agricultural Foundation (NCAF) was founded in 1944 as a means of supporting agricultural research, extension, and teaching activities in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at North Carolina State University. NCAF works to aid and promote, by financial assistance and otherwise, all types of education and research in agriculture at or through NC State University.
