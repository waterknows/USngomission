Founded in 1972, National People's Action (NPA) is a network of grassroots organizations with a fierce reputation for direct action from across the country that work to advance a national economic and racial justice agenda. NPA has over 200 organizers working to unite everyday people in cities, towns, and rural communities throughout the United States through direct-action, house meetings and community organizing. NPA staffs and supports three local, state and national campaigns in support of economic and racial justice: bank accountability, housing justice, and immigrant and worker's rights.
