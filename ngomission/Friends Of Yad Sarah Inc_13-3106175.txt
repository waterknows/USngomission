Friends of Yad Sarah supports the largest voluntary organization in Israel, which provides a spectrum of free or nominal cost services designed to make life easier for sick, disabled and elderly people and their families. Yad Sarah's mission is to keep the ill and the elderly in their homes and out of institutions as long as possible. Yad Sarah's best-known service is the lending of medical and rehabilitative equipment on a short-term basis free of charge to anyone who needs it - from a stock over 250,000 items, from crutches and wheelchairs to oxygen concentrators and electronic monitors. We also provide services including: transportation and day care centers for the disabled, drop-in centers and minimum-charge dental clinics for the elderly, personal computerized emergency alarms, and guidance/exhibition centers which help disabled people choose assistive devices.
