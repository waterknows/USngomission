Founded in 1990, Pennsylvania Partnerships for Children (PPC) is a children's advocacy organization, advancing government policies that improve the health, early learning, and well-being of Pennsylvania's children. The PPC focuses on five core issues: child welfare, children's health, early learning, public education through post-secondary completion and afterschool youth development. The PPC's vision is to make Pennsylvania one of the top 10 states to be a child and to raise a child. Today, Pennsylvania ranks 17th in child well-being, according to the 2013 Annie E. Casey Foundation's national KIDS COUNT report.
