Here at the Boys & Girls Clubs of Las Vegas, our mission is to enable all young people, especially those who need us most, to reach their full potential as productive, caring, responsible citizens. Our core programs engage young people in activities with adults, peers and family members that enable them to reach their full potential. Based on the interests and needs of the boys and girls they serve, clubs offer diverse program activities in five areas: Character and Leadership Development, Education and Career Development, The Arts, Sports Fitness and Recreation, and Health and Life Skills. Boys & Girls Clubs are a safe place to learn and grow all while having fun. They are truly The Positive Place For Kids.
