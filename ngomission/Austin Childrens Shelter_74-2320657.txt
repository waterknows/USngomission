Austin Children's Services (formerly Austin Children's Shelter) has been working to end child abuse and neglect in the Austin community since 1984. ACS protects and heals children and youth who have experienced abuse and/or neglect by providing a safe home and supportive services through our residential programs: Emergency Shelter Care, a Transitional Living Program for youth working toward independence, a Teen Parent Program helping young mothers in foster care break the cycle of abuse and Respite Care. ACS has dramatically expanded its services to include community-based programs that work toward safety, permanency and well-being through the provision of various programs, including: Strong Start, a child abuse prevention program for at-risk families with children under age 6; the Care Academy, a child development and family support center; and Foster in Austin, a program to recruit, train, monitor and support loving families that provide foster placements for children.
