Founded in 1984, PATH's mission is to restore hope with a personalized approach to empower our East Texas neighbors to thrive in our community. PATH's programs address the multiple factors affecting low income families that keep them in poverty, focusing on our organization's core strengths, Housing and Casework. Our Transitional Housing Program provides a 2-year period of affordable housing combined with active case management, adult education, enhanced savings and child mentoring. We address the immediate needs of our neighbors in need with services set in motion by a visit and a private interview with a volunteer or staff caseworker. Services available through this Casework include the premier choice food pantry in Smith County, rent and utility assistance and basic medical services provided offsite.
