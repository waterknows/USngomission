A global proclamation ministry, Ramesh Richard Evangelism and Church Health (RREACH) implements God's calling and gifting on Dr. Ramesh Richard to promote the Lord Jesus Christ worldwide. We accelerate our global impact by wise use and mix of personal proclamation, media outreach, and ministry training to evangelize opinion leaders, strengthen pastoral leaders, and reach large numbers of individuals, especially of Asia, Africa and Latin America. Founded in 1987, RREACH envisions changing the way one billion individuals think and hear about the Lord Jesus Christ, to the glory of the Father and by the power of the Holy Spirit.
