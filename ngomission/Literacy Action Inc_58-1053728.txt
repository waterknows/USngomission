Literacy Action was created in 1968 with a vision to build a society where parents are able to help their children with homework, workers are prepared to enter the job market and succeed, and families can use education to leverage themselves out of poverty and become self-sufficient. Today, Literacy Action is the largest community-based literacy agency in Georgia, where professional adult-education teachers provide the full continuum of courses needed by low-income, undereducated adults. Our mission is to build better futures for undereducated adults by teaching life, literacy and work skills that empower them to reach their highest potential.
