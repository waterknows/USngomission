Since 1971, Open Meadow Alternative Schools has been making a difference in the lives of North Portland youth. Open Meadow Schools offers a personalized educational experience for middle and high school youth. Our mission is to educate youth in small, relationship-based programs that emphasize personal responsibility, academics, and service to the community. Open Meadow successfully re-engages disconnected youth in their education, providing academic and support services to those at high risk of dropping out of school. We educate students in small middle and high school programs and provide an array of transition services that help students move smoothly from middle school to high school and from high school to college and career. In 2007-08, Open Meadow served more than 700 youth in our programs.
