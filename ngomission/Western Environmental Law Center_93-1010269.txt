Founded in 1993, the Western Environmental Law Center (WELC) uses the power of the law to safeguard the treasured landscapes, iconic wildlife, and communities of the American West.WELC has a highly experienced team of attorneys, conservation biologists, and Western policy experts. We work close to the ground, with offices in Oregon, New Mexico, Montana, and Washington--and we work at the national, regional, state, and local levels; and in all three branches of government.As a public interest law firm, WELC does not charge clients and partners for services, but relies instead on charitable gifts from individuals, families, and foundations to accomplish our mission.
