In 1974 the evangelistic organization that today is still known as Christ for all Nations (CfaN), was born and a small team gathered around the young evangelists to reach out to the peoples of Africa. The preaching of the Word began to produce a harvest of souls and in addition to this, people were being healed of all kinds of diseases. The purpose of CfaN is to fulfill the great commission of Jesus Christ by taking the message of salvation to all peoples of the world. CfaN is primarily known for its crusades in Africa and other third world countries. In addition, the ministry seeks to actively inspire and equip the body of Christ for evangelism through conferences, literature, videos and television. The ministry has one motto, Hell empty and Heaven full.
