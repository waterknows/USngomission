Hackley School is an independent, college-preparatory, non-sectarian, day and boarding school for students in kindergarten through twelfth grade. Founded in 1899, it became co-educational in 1970. Hackley challenges students to grow in character, scholarship and accomplishment, to offer unreserved effort, and to learn from our community's varying perspectives and backgrounds. Hackley believes that students will grow in character and responsibility by participating in structured activity that serves the needs of people outside the spheres of home and school. By committing their energy, time, and imagination to serving those needs, students can experience the satisfaction of helping others and can gain some appreciation of the complexity and concerns of the larger community.
