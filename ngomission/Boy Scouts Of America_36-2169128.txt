The mission of the Boy Scouts of America, Pathway to Adventure Council (formerly Chicago Area Council) is to prepare young people to make ethical and moral choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the scout oath and law. Our council is building on the foundation of a strong program legacy. From Cub Scouts through Boy Scouts, Venturing, Exploring, and Learning for Life, great dedicated volunteers are impacting the youth of our communities everyday. In 2007, total youth membership serviced through council programs was 44,431, representing one in every seven local young people.
