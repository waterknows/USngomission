Inspire Women was founded in 2003 with no money in the bank, just a clear vision from God for a ministry that would go beyond conferences to provide mentorship, support and investment to women looking to unlock their God-given potential. Since our founding, we have grown to invest millions in scholarships, grants and support for women of all races and economic backgrounds. Through our leadership institute, inner circles, citywide events and annual servant search program and, most importantly, the ministry work of the women we invest in around the world, we help women find their spark and follow their God-given calling.
