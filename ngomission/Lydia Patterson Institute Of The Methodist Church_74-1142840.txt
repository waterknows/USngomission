Founded in 1913, Lydia Patterson Institute is the only remaining United Methodist institution in the United States that serves a predominately Hispanic population. Lydia Patterson Institute continues to serve as a church-related and church-supported institution because of its mission to serve a special human need in an environment where faith and knowledge interact to enrich our lives and develop Christian leadership for church and society. Our mission is to: represent the Christian faith as understood by the United Methodist Church; provide quality bi-lingual, cross-cultural academic education; provide a center where local church leaders, clergy and lay persons, may receive training and experience; and develop leadership skills in persons interested in positions of Christian ministry.
