The United Way of Rhode Island (UWRI), formerly United Way of Southeastern New England, traces its roots to the Providence Community Fund (PCF), founded in 1926. Our mission is to mobilize the caring power of our community to improve the lives of people in need. Our current focus areas are: helping people and neighborhoods thrive; helping families engage in their children's success; housing and homelessness; and helping people in crisis.
