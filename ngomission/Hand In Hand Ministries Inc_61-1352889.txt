Hand in Hand Ministries is a local, regional and international organization that builds strong communities and transform lives through cultural immersion, education, housing, and healthcare.Our Vision: We believe that building strong communities around the world begins at home.We provide resources for the economically vulnerable through our on-going programs that focus on safe housing, education, and health care and by forming partnerships with local organizations and individuals in the regions where we have year-round operations. Our hope is that those we serve may one day become self-sufficient and enabled to help others.An important part of what we do is offer people the opportunity for hands-on experiences through our unique program of immersion trips. It is our hope that volunteers will return from their trip experience inspired to build a more just world - one family at a time.In all that we do, we seek to build community.
