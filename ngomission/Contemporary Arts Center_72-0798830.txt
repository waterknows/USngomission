The Contemporary Arts Center, New Orleans (CAC) is a multi-disciplinary arts center dedicated to the presentation, production and promotion of art of our time. The CAC organizes curated exhibitions, performances and programs; enlarges audiences; and encourages collaboration among diverse artists, institutions, communities and supporters. Our vision is that the CAC will be nationally recognized as a leader in the presentation and support of contemporary arts, artists and emerging art forms. Since 1976, the CAC has been home to artists' bold experiments in painting, theater, photography, performance art, dance, music, video, education, and sculpture.
