Jewish Family & Career Services of Atlanta is dedicated to helping both Jewish and non-Jewish individuals, families and communities meet the challenges of daily life. Our dedication is translated into a continuum of services and programs that focus on the multiplicity of challenging circumstances confronted by all of us over the life span. As a dynamic and progressive organization, Jewish Family & Career Services looks to its visionary leadership, creative management, dedicated and compassionate employees, and inspired volunteers in providing inclusive and far-reaching programs. The agency is actively engaged in collaborative efforts with other organizations, community groups and synagogues to provide off-site, community-based services.
