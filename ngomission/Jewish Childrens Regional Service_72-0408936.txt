Jewish Children's Regional Service (JCRS), formerly the Jewish Children's Home, began in 1855 as an orphanage and is currently the oldest existing Jewish child welfare organization in the United States, as well as the only regional Jewish child welfare agency in the country. The Agency's services to children span the service fields of: mental health, child welfare, child development, higher education, and the Jewish education/camping experience. The JCRS professional staff are advocates for children and are committed to the comprehensive coordination of services to young people whenever possible, whether through the JCRS or through other agencies. JCRS serves Jewish children in Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Texas.
