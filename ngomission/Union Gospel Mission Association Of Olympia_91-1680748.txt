The Olympia Union Gospel Mission began its work with the homeless and needy in 1995 through a street ministry outreach. Sandwiches and hot drinks were offered in an atmosphere of love and acceptance. Our goal was and still is to share God's love in practical ways. Today, the Olympia Union Gospel Mission has numerous programs. Hundreds of men and women are served each week and OUGM is still sharing God's love in practical ways. At the same time, we work to help individuals break the cycle of homelessness and poverty. Meals, hygiene and addiction recovery services are ways we reach out to make a difference in people's lives. Hot meals is one of the most powerful tools for sharing the Gospel with people in need because food is a tangible way to show God's love (Luke 10:27).
