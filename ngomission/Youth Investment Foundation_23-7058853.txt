Timber Bay works to create new attitudes and behavior in alienated youth through a growing faith in Christ, supportive staff counseling and healthy relationships. Timber Bay seeks out the unseen kids among us who struggle the most. Our staff of professional youth workers develop long-term relationships with the youth we serve through a dynamic camping and community approach. Timber Bay staff and volunteers build long-term relationships with youth through retreats, mentoring, activities, and unconditional love.
