Freedom Institute was founded in 1976 as a resource center for individuals and families affected by alcohol and drug dependency. The Institute is committed to providing confidential, personalized, sensitive and effective professional service through programs of intervention, recovery care for adults and adolescents, and prevention education curricula and consultation to New York City schools. Our goal is to help people realize that there is hope for recovery with acceptance, trust and commitment, and to assist them through the process.
