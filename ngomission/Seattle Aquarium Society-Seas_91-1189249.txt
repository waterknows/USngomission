The Seattle Aquarium has been an integral part of the city and the region since 1977. In the 34 years since its founding, we have hosted more than 21 million guests, offering inspiration and education about our marine environment to visitors from eight to 90. Our mission is to inspire conservation of our marine environment, and we believe the key to caring about the health of our environment lies in experiencing it. Our goals are to:

- provide opportunities for animals to connect people to the wonders of the marine world;

- educate audiences about our local marine life, the stressors to the ocean's habitat and our need for ecosystem solutions;

- offer exciting exhibits and educational programs that provide lifelong learning opportunities to local, national and international audiences;

- encourage Aquarium visitors to embrace and pursue scientific knowledge by conducting and disseminating biological research in ways that trigger curiosity and inspire passion.
