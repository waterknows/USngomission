Lydia's House works in faith to end domestic violence, by being a place of healing and a voice of hope for abused women and their children. Lydia's House fulfills this mission by: providing safe, affordable transitional housing in a confidential location for a maximum of two years; assisting women and their children to create and implement long term individual life-goal plans which include education, training, employment, and safe housing; facilitating access to information and referrals to community resources; and creating awareness about domestic violence through a speakers' bureau and an outreach educational ministry.
