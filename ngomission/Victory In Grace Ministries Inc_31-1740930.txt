Founded in 2001, the mission of Victory in Grace is to help every person begin a relationship with Jesus Christ through acceptance of the Gospel of grace; to help believers grow by providing regular verse-by-verse Bible teaching, helpful books and resources and regular participation in a Bible-believing and teaching local church. Our goal is to help every person find victory in life through God's abundant grace. Whether it's through a radio or television broadcast in the United States, an orphanage and child-care facility in India, literature in the dark of prisons, we're doing our best to fulfill God's call to share His love with the world.
