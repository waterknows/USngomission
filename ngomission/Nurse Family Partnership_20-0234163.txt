Nurse-Family Partnership empowers first-time moms living in poverty to successfully change their lives and the lives of their children through evidence-based nurse home visiting. Nurse-Family Partnership is a community health program that truly changes lives for generations to come. Through ongoing home visits from registered nurses, low-income, first-time moms receive the care and support they need to have a healthy pregnancy, provide responsible and competent care for their children, and become more economically self-sufficient. From pregnancy until the child turns two years old, Nurse-Family Partnership Nurse Home Visitors form a much-needed, trusting relationship with the first-time moms, instilling confidence and empowering them to achieve a better life for their children and themselves. An evidence-based community health program, Nurse-Family Partnership's outcomes include long-term family improvements in health, education, and economic self-sufficiency.
