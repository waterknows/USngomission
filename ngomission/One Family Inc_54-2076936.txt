Founded in 1999 by Paul and Phyllis Fireman and family, One Family, Inc. is dedicated to ending family homelessness in Massachusetts. This mission grows out of a core belief that no parent and child should be without a place to call home in such a richly resourced state. One Family works for change by collaborating with elected officials, faith and community leaders, businesses and foundations, and higher learning institutions to develop and implement innovative programs that reverse the widespread, chronic effects of poverty and strengthen lower-income and homeless families.
