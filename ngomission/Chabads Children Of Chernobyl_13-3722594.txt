Chabad's Children of Chernobyl (CCOC) evacuates kids from the radioactive Chernobyl region and provides them with critical medical care, new homes, and excellent education in Israel. CCOC also provides children currently living in the radioactive zone with medicine and advanced medical equipment. The children suffer from radiation-induced immune suppression which requires immediate care to prevent minor ailments from developing into major emergencies. CCOC brings doctors from the contaminated areas to the USA and Israel for medical training, and has rehabilitated orphanages in the affected areas. CCOC is dedicated to saving children's lives and to improve the health of those adversely affected by the Chernobyl disaster.
