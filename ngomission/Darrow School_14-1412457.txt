Darrow School, founded in 1932 on the site of the original Shaker community, is a boarding and day school for grades 9-12 offering a comprehensive, hands-on, college-preparatory curriculum in a supportive environment. A 5-to-1 student-to-teacher ratio allows for a high level of individual attention, and an average class size of nine students affords all students the opportunity to actively participate in the learning process. At Darrow School, we are dedicated to serving students with diverse backgrounds and abilities, building on each student's individual talents and interests to inspire enduring confidence for success in college and life. Darrow is distinctive among independent schools because of its integration of sustainability themes across the curriculum and the belief that learning can happen in and out of the classroom.
