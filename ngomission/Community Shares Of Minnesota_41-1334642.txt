Community Shares of Minnesota (formerly Community Solutions Fund) is a community-based fund for social justice. We bring people and resources together to create strong, healthy communities and a more equitable Minnesota. Community Shares of Minnesota is a workplace giving organization that turns up the heat. On discrimination. On situations that reinforce poverty. On attitudes that look the other way at inequality. And by turning up the heat with smart and effective solutions - led by the very communities that are often held down - we're creating a world where a single working parent has access to both good and affordable childcare. Where entire neighborhoods can have a voice in policy decisions that affect their daily lives. A place where charities become less necessary.
