In 1910, the Dayton Jewish community named six health and welfare agencies as its beneficiaries, establishing what is now the Jewish Federation of Greater Dayton. Today, the Jewish Federation of Greater Dayton is the central organization established to further the welfare of the Jewish community. The Federation coordinates social, welfare and cultural programs; fosters cooperation among Jewish organizations; facilitates fund-raising activities on the local and national level; and stimulates participation and interest in community-wide activities. The Jewish Federation of Greater Dayton enriches and sustains Jewish life in Dayton and around the world through its social service, cultural, educational, recreational, fund-raising and planning programs.
