Make the Road New York promotes economic justice, equity and opportunity for all New Yorkers through community and electoral organizing, strategic policy advocacy, leadership development, youth and adult education, and high quality legal and support services. Created in 2007 by the coming together of Make the Road by Walking and the Latin American Integration Center, Make the Road New York is an effort to build power for New York City's low-income and immigrant majority. Make the Road by Walking was founded in 1997 in a Bushwick church basement by local residents to address the potentially devastating effects of welfare reform on America's poor and immigrant communities.
