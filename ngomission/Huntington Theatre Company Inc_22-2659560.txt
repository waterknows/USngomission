Founded in 1982 by Boston University, The Huntington Theatre Company is Boston's largest and most popular theatre company and one of the nation's most respected. The company stages its productions in two world-class venues: the historic, Broadway-style, 890-seat Boston University Theatre on Huntington Avenue, and the state-of-the-art Stanford Calderwood Pavilion at the Boston Center for the Arts, built and operated by the Huntington since 2004, houses the 370-seat Virginia Wimberly Theatre and the 200-seat Nancy and Edward Roberts Studio. Over the past two decades, the Huntington's nationally recognized education programs have served more than 200,000 middle school and high school students, and its community outreach programs bring theatre each year to the deaf and blind communities, the elderly, and other underserved populations in the Greater Boston area.
