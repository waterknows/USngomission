The mission of Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Washington (BGCGW) is to help boys and girls of all backgrounds, especially those who need us most, build confidence, develop character and acquire the skills needed to become productive, civic-minded, responsible adults. Established in 1886, BGCGW's 18 Clubs - covering a territory of 75 miles that stretches from Fredericksburg to Germantown - serve as safe havens for our members. The clubs are open when schools are not, and provide a safe, comfortable, and fun alternative to youth who would otherwise be home alone or on the street. Nearly 21,000 members attend the Clubs for activities, to see their friends, and to spend time with positive and encouraging adults.
