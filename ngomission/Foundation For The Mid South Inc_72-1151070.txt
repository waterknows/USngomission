Created in 1990, the Foundation for the Mid South (FMS) is a regional development foundation serving Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. We seek to strengthen the capacities and resources of institutions and communities to improve the quality of life for all Mid Southerners. The FMS invests in people and strategies that build philanthropy and promote racial, social, and economic equity in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. FMS is in the business of creating long-term sustainable change in the Mid South. To ensure success in all aspects of our work, FMS emphasizes the importance of: community engagement, inclusion, community philanthropy, partnerships, leadership and public policy improvement.
