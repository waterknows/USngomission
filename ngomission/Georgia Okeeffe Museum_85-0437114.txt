The Georgia O'Keeffe Museum, in Santa Fe, New Mexico, opened to the public in July 1997, eleven years after the death of the artist from whom it takes its name. Welcoming more than 2.2 million visitors from all over the world and the most visited art museum in the state of New Mexico, it is the only museum in the world dedicated to an internationally-known woman artist. The Georgia O'Keeffe Museum is dedicated to perpetuating the artistic legacy of Georgia O'Keeffe and to the study and interpretation of American modernism. The Museum's collections, exhibitions, research center, publications, and education programs contribute to scholarly discourse and serve diverse audiences.
