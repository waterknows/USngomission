The Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice, formerly the Milton and Rose D. Friedman Foundation, was founded in 1996 upon the ideals and theories of Nobel Laureate economist Milton Friedman and economist Rose D. Friedman. The Friedman Foundation strives to educate parents, public policy makers and organizations about the desperate need to return power to the parents of America who have minimal choices and limited voices in the education of their children. The Foundation serves as an important resource for parents and community groups who want greater choice in education, and are ready to fight for it. The Foundation is the only national organization dedicated solely to advancing the vision of an education system where all parents are free to choose, and we bring an unsurpassed clarity of purpose to the education reform debate.
