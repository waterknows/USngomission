The mission of Amazing Place is to provide fellowship, memory care and wellness for adults with mild to moderate memory loss and support to their families and the community. Amazing Place is currently located in a state-of-the-art, "green" facility where the organization can serve up to 60 participants per day. Our model day program offers five unique rooms and a beautiful garden for participant activities. Caregiver families also have space designed specifically for their training, education, socialization and conferencing with staff.
