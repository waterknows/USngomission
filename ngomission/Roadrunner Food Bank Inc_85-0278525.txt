Roadrunner Food Bank of New Mexico has been serving New Mexico's hungry since 1980 and is the leader in creating solutions to end hunger in New Mexico. Roadrunner solicits, collects, and transports more than 30 million pounds of food yearly. Food comes from a variety of sources including national and local manufacturers, supermarkets, large food distributors, growers, food brokers and food drives. Roadrunner Food Bank distributes the food through a statewide network of 440 food pantries, group homes, low-income day care centers, shelters, soup kitchens, its own direct service programs, and regional food banks. In turn, these organizations provide emergency food to 70,000 low-income people each week.
