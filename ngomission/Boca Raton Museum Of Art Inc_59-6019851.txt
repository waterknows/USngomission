With roots back to the late 1940s, the mission of the Boca Raton Museum of Art is to enhance the appreciation and understanding of the visual arts by enriching the lives of visitors to and residents of our diverse community through the acquisition and maintenance of a permanent collection from antiquity to the present reflecting the art of world cultures, and the presentation of high quality and varied exhibitions with related educational programs and special events. The Museum further contributes to this learning process by providing hands-on instruction at its Studio School, which offers fine art, craft and interdisciplinary classes, workshops and summer camp for children.
