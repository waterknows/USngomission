Since 1949, the Fresno Rescue Mission has been helping homeless and at-risk individuals with not only physical needs of food, clothing and shelter, but providing spiritual support that comes from the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Everything we do is Christ-centered. We're more than a soup kitchen or flop house. The Fresno Rescue Mission is a Christ-centered organization open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. No fees are ever charged for services to the homeless. The Fresno Rescue Mission endeavors to glorify God by meeting the spiritual and physical needs of the least, the last and the lost in our community.
