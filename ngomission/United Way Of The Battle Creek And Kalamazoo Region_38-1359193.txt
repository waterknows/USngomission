The vision of United Way of the Battle Creek and Kalamazoo Region (UWBCKR) is to mobilize the caring power of the community to improve lives. We advance the common good in the City of Battle Creek and Kalamazoo County by creating opportunities for a better life for all. We focus on the areas of education, income stability, and health - the building blocks for a good quality life. We all win when a child succeeds in school, when a family becomes financially stable, and when people have good health.UWBCKR recruits people and organizations which bring the passion, expertise, and resources to get things done. Individuals can give, advocate, and volunteer. That's what it means to LIVE UNITED.
