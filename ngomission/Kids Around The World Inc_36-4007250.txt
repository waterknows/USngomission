Kids Around the World was founded in 1994 to provide safe play equipment for children that found themselves in situations where it was difficult to just be a kid. Kids Around the World is a faith-based organization that believes many children around the world have lost the hope and joy they should experience as a result of war, natural disasters, and economic stress. We want to restore that hope with the power of play, by building playgrounds. In 2003, we became affiliated with Campus Crusade for Christ and partner directly with The JESUS Film. Kids Around The World trains and equips churches and Sunday School teachers around the world to visually share the truths of the Bible to the children in their communities.
