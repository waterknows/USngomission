Piedmont Park Conservancy's (PPC) mission is to enhance and preserve Piedmont Park as a vital, urban green space and as a cultural and recreational resource that enhances the quality of life for all Atlantans. Since 1989, the Conservancy has raised and invested more than $23 million in private funds to transform the once dilapidated Park into the most visited in green space in Atlanta. In addition to raising funds for capital improvements throughout the 185-acre park, the Conservancy manages more than 90 percent of the Park's daily maintenance care and security.
