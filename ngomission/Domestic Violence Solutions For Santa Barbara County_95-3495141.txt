Domestic Violence Solutions for Santa Barbara County works to end the intergenerational cycle of domestic violence by providing prevention and intervention services and by challenging society's attitudes, beliefs and behaviors to effect social change. We provide safe and confidential shelter for battered women and their children throughout Santa Barbara County and emotional support and personal advocacy to battered women and other women in crisis, enabling them to recognize strengths and resources within themselves. We encourage women to be empowered to be free to make choices. We play a leadership role in effecting social change by educating the community, by associations with other social change groups and by supporting the work of women's rights organizations.
