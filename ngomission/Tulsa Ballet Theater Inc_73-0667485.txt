The story of Tulsa Ballet began in 1956. Husband and wife Roman Jasinski and Moscelyne Larkin, and musician Rosalie Talbott, founded Tulsa Ballet Theatre, blending classical dance with dramatic theatre. Today, Tulsa Ballet annually reaches more than 40,000 individuals across Oklahoma and employs a multi-cultural roster of dancers comprised of 29 highly-skilled professionals representing 14 different countries. Under the leadership of Artistic Director Marcello Angelini, Tulsa Ballet has reached new heights on the stage, while bringing unprecedented recognition to Tulsa and the State of Oklahoma by developing an artistic reputation marked by innovative works with international impact.
