Founded in 1982, St. John's Bread & Life works to bring food to the poor and accompany them on their journey to wholeness by providing necessary services. We advocate for them, always mindful of the words of St. Vincent "to serve others as we would serve Christ." The St. John's Bread and Life kitchen is our principle effort in helping those in need, by providing our community daily with a good solid meal, providing our guests the opportunity to start that day well. Bread and Life daily addresses the issues of hunger and poverty in Brooklyn and Queens. Every day, Bread and Life serves over one thousand meals to hungry New Yorkers. Our goal is to combat poverty and help people achieve self-sufficiency, in addition to educating the public and increasing awareness about meals to needy New Yorkers.
