In its first year, New Pathways provided mentoring services to 40 youths from the Greater Phoenix area. Today, there are over 500 youths served annually. Throughout its history, New Pathways has developed programming that transforms the lives of at-risk youth through the power of mentoring. Having grown by acquisition of mentoring programs over the years, the organization has become a thought leader in transformative mentoring programs.New Pathways serves youth whose needs go far beyond companionship. The youth face environmental circumstances (poverty, gangs, substance abuse, violence, etc.) that have resulted in problematic and disruptive attitudes and behaviors. New Pathways for Youth facilitates transformative relationships between youth ages 9 - 21 and adult mentors, to help these youth reach their greatest possible potential.
