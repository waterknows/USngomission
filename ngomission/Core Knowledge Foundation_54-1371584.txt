The Core Knowledge Foundation publishes and distributes a wide variety of education books and materials, including the Core Knowledge Sequence, a detailed outline of recommended curricular content to be taught in language arts, history and geography, mathematics, science, music, and the visual arts from preschool to grade eight. We support a growing nationwide network of Core Knowledge schools through instructional materials and professional development workshops. The Foundation also offers Core Knowledge Language Arts, a program for preschool through third grade that systematically teaches the language skills and content knowledge children need to build reading comprehension and write in multiple genres.
