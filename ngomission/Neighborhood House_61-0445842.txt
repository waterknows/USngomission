Neighborhood House is a community center serving Portland, one of Louisville's oldest and most diverse, but also most impoverished communities. Our mission is to provide individuals with opportunities to enhance the quality of their lives and our vision is to break the cycle of poverty for our children and families! We have four core program areas, serving infants from 6 weeks old in our Child Development Center to senior adults in our Four Seasons Program.
