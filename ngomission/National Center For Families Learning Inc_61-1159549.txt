Founded in 1989, the mission of the National Center for Families Learning (NCFL) is to create a literate nation by leveraging the power of the family. NCFL works to: create understanding about low literacy; develop, evaluate, and replicate programs and interventions poised to break the cycle of low literacy for families with the greatest barriers to success; creative innovative solutions to learning English and achieving literacy proficiency for the nation's immigrant population; support teachers, practitioners and community providers who deliver literacy services; provide families with tools and information necessary to build literacy into their home and daily life; and assist communities and service organizations in designing and developing strategic programs.
