Since 1945, the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation has been preparing leaders and reshaping institutions for the nation's most essential professions. Through a suite of fellowship programs, the Foundations opens doors to education, particularly for women, people of color, and underrepresented groups. Each year the Foundation awards fellowships to more than 150 future leaders.



Building on this mission to prepare outstanding individuals for careers that shape the nation's future, the Foundation is now addressing the critical need for children, particularly those in low-income districts, to have access to well-prepared, committed teachers. The Woodrow Wilson Teaching Fellowship recruits very able candidates to teaching careers in science, technology, and mathematics (STEM) - subjects with critical teacher shortages - and places them in schools that most need them.
