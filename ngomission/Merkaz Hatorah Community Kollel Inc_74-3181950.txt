Merkaz Hatorah Community Kollel (The Torah Center of Los Angeles) began functioning in the summer of 2007. The purpose of the Kollel is twofold: first and foremost, to provide an environment of intense learning and study that will afford its members the opportunity to develop into accomplished Torah scholars who will in turn be able to take positions in leadership and education; and secondly, to serve as a Makom Torah for the community. In addition, the Kollel creates Shiurim and learning opportunities throughout the Community such as our Sunday morning Beis Medrash Programme in Young Israel of Century City and lunch time Shiurim in different local offices.
