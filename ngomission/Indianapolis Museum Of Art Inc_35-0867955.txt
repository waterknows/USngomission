Founded in 1883, the Indianapolis Museum of Art (IMA) serves the creative interests of its communities by fostering exploration of art, design, and the natural environment. With a collection of over 50,000 works of art, the IMA promotes these interests through the collection, presentation, interpretation and conservation of its artistic, historic, and environmental assets. The Museum also features national and international traveling exhibitions throughout the year. Upon completion, the Virginia B. Fairbanks Art & Nature Park will provide an urban oasis with 100 acres of woodlands, wetlands, lake and meadows located adjacent to the Museum. Oldfields-Lilly House & Gardens offers visitors a glimpse into the lives of one of Indianapolis's most interesting and prominent families, the Josiah K Lilly Jr. Family.
