Migdal Ohr ("Tower of Light") is Israel's leading non-profit organization for children at risk. Founded over 40 years ago by Israel Prize winner Rabbi Yitzchak Dovid Grossman, Migdal Ohr currently serves over 10,000 orphaned, abandoned, impoverished and new immigrant children across Israel annually, through its 160 youth clubs and three main campuses. Migdal Ohr provides indigent children (from birth to adulthood) with an outstanding education, a loving home, clothing, food, medical care, and psychological counseling. The graduates of Migdal Ohr go on to become productive Israeli citizens and, most notably, our alumni are among Israel's top doctors, lawyers, community leaders, army generals, and a member of the Knesset. Migdal Ohr is dedicated to making a difference in the future of Israel. American Friends of Migdal Ohr is the US fundraising arm for Migdal Ohr in Israel.
