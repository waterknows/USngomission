The Boys & Girls Club of Stamford is a dedicated youth facility that is open daily, is managed by a professional staff, and available and affordable to all youth. We have provided after school activities and youth development services to the youth of Stamford, Connecticut since 1927. This defines our essence. An increasing number of school age children are at home with no adult care or supervision. Boys and girls in our community are often left to find their own recreation and companionship in the streets. These young people need to know that someone cares about them. The Club offers this and more. We serve more than 1,000 children, ages 6-18, offering programs and services that promote and enhance their development.
