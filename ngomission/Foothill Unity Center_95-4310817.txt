Foothill Unity Center is a multi-service agency that is the primary provider of food, temporary shelter, transportation, referrals, and a variety of health services to low-income children, individuals and families living at or below 150% of the national poverty line. The Center's service area spans the Foothill communities of Pasadena, Altadena, South Pasadena, Sierra Madre, Arcadia, Monrovia, Bradbury and Duarte. More recently, however, the Center expanded its programs to include Azusa, Baldwin Park and Irwindale due to the poor economy and a lack of services in those areas. Currently, the percentage of people living below the Federal poverty rate in Foothill Unity Center's service area is 16.3% for adults and 22.8% for children; slightly higher than Los Angeles County as a whole.
