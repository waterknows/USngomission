Joyful Heart Foundation's mission is to heal, education and empower survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse, and to shed light into darkness that surrounds these issues. Inspired by her deep connection and love for Hawaiâ€˜i, where she first experienced her own heart awakening, Mariska Hargitay founded Joyful Heart in Kona in 2004, with the intention of helping sexual assault survivors heal and reclaim a sense of joy in their lives. Today, Joyful Heart is a national organization with hubs of service in New York, Los Angeles and Honolulu. The vision of the Joyful Heart Foundation is a community with no sexual assault, domestic violence or child abuse.
