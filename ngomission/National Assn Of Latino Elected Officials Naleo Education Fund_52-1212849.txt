The NALEO (National Association of Latino Elected Appointed Officials) Educational Fund facilitates the full participation of Latinos in the American political process, from citizenship to public service. A nonpartisan organization first established in 1981, we carry out our mission through programs that integrate Latinos fully into American political society, provide professional development opportunities and technical assistance to the nation's more than 6,000 Latino elected and appointed officials, and monitor and conduct advocacy on issues important to the Latino community and our political participation.
