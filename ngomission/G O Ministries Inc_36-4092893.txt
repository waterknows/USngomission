Incorporated in 1996, G.O. Ministries is a Christian organization dedicated to the ministry of short-term missions and the development of partnerships of ministry. Our goal is to recruit, equip and coordinate people for short-term mission adventures that will mutually challenge each participant and support the inspiring efforts of National Christian leaders abroad. G.O. Ministries was established after its founder, Brook Brotzman, traveled to the Dominican Republic and Haiti and witnessed the extreme poverty and spiritual oppression there. In 2006, G.O. Ministries expanded into Mongolia, Colombia, Belize, and beyond.
