Alliance for Global Justice (AfGJ) works to achieve social change and economic justice by helping to build a stronger more unified grassroots movement. We recognize that the concentration of wealth and power is the root cause of oppression requiring us to work together across ideologies, issues and communities. The Alliance nurtures organizations seeking fundamental change in international and national conditions that disempower people, create disparities in access to wealth and power, poison the earth, and plunder its resources. Our commitment to solidarity and to non-hierarchical democratic process enables us to respectfully listen and respond to each other within the movement. AfGJ also fiscally sponsors projects such as Occupy Wall Street, Courage to Resist, United Students Against Sweatshops and many more.
