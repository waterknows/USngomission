The mission of the Cystinosis Research Foundation is to support bench, clinical and translational research for better treatments and a cure for cystinosis. Through our aggressively funded research agenda, the Cystinosis Research Foundation issues grants for bench and clinical research studies bi-annually in order to accelerate research progress and ensure that cystinosis research is on-going and focused on novel treatments and a cure. The Cystinosis Research Foundation is dedicated to educating the public and the medical community about cystinosis to ensure early diagnosis and proper treatment.
