The mission of United Way for Southeastern Michigan is to mobilize the caring power of Detroit and Southeastern Michigan to improve communities and individual lives in measurable and lasting ways. Created by the merger of United Way Community Services and the United Way of Oakland on April 1, 2005, the United Way's history in Southeastern Michigan dates back to 1912. Our agenda for change centers on three focus areas - education, income and basic needs - identified by the community, and it will guide our work for the next 10 years.
