Peninsula Humane Society and SPCA (PHS/SPCA), guided by the humane ethic, builds healthy relationships between people and animals. Since 2003, we have adopted 100% of healthy, adoptable dogs and cats. Our Hope Program helps the neediest animals and gives them a second chance at life. Many animals need extra medical care, behavior training, or TLC before they can be adopted into a new forever home. Hope saves an average of 180 animals every month. Our low-cost and free spay/neuter programs help fight against pet overpopulation, and have been highly effective. Since the start of our Spay/Neuter Clinic in 1970 there has been an 80% reduction in the number of cats and dogs coming into our shelter. Additional services include cruelty investigations, education programs, and wildlife rehabilitation.
