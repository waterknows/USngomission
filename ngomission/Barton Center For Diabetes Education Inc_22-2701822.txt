The mission of The Barton Center for Diabetes Education is to improve the lives of children with insulin-dependent diabetes through education, recreation, and support programs which inspire and empower. One of the largest, independent camping and educational programs in the country dedicated to children who live with diabetes and the people who care for them, The Barton Center is a year-round camp, retreat, and conference center where learning and shared experiences combine to support and motivate children and families. More than 2,000 children and their families participate in our programs annually, including the Clara Barton Resident Camp for girls, Camp Joslin for boys, coed Adventure/Wilderness Leadership Programs, Family Programs, and coed Day Camps in New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts.
