Founded in 1919, Capital Area United Way's mission is to unite people and resources to solve defined problems and improve the quality of life for individuals and families in our communities. United Way exists for one reason - to strengthen our community through individual and family well-being. Community volunteers from all walks of life identify critical needs in our community and addresses them with collective focus and action through three priority areas: healthy, caring communities; safe, stable households; and learning from youth to young adult. United Way also engages community leaders, businesses and governmental agencies to work together to make our community a better place for everyone.
