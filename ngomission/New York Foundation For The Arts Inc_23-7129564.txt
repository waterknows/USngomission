The mission of the New York Foundation for the Arts (NYFA) is to empower artists at critical stages of their creative lives. Recognizing the broad-ranging needs of our constituents, we conduct our activities through three primary channels: financial support to individual artists, dance and theater companies; professional development training through workshops, seminars and individual consultations; and extensive online resources for artists and organizations.
