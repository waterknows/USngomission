Founded in 2000, Oaks Christian School (OCS) provides an education of unsurpassed quality to 1000 students in grades 6 through 12. Graduates attend many of the most selective universities and colleges. Our mission is to dedicate ourselves to Christ in the pursuit of academic excellence, artistic expression, and athletic distinction while growing in knowledge and wisdom through God's abundant grace. OCS strives to develop in students a lifelong love of learning, an abiding faith in Christ, and personal integrity. Through purposeful, active mentorship our faculty not only teach the practical skills of college preparation, but they expose students to larger questions of the vastness and greatness of God.
