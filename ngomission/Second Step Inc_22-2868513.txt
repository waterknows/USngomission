The Second Step fosters the safety, stability, and well-being of survivors of domestic violence.Our residential and community-based programs build on the strengths, needs, and values of the individuals and families we serve. In partnership with survivors and in collaboration with the community, we lay a foundation for a future free from abuse and full of possibility. Founded in 1992, The Second Step partners with survivors to address the aftermath of abuse and build brighter futures for themselves and their children. The Second Step also works to address the root causes of domestic violence and end it in our time.
