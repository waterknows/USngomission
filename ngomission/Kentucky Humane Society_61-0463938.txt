Founded in 1884, the Kentucky Humane Society (KHS) is one of the oldest animal welfare organizations in the nation and the state's largest animal agency, in terms of animals served and scope of mission programs. KHS chooses to accept all dogs and cats in need. KHS advocates the humane treatment of companion animals through leadership and proactive solutions to pet overpopulation, including adoptions, education and spay/neuter efforts. For more than 125 years, KHS has been providing shelter, food and medical care for thousands of unwanted animals each year. Thanks to the community's continued support, we're making Louisville and its surrounding areas a better place for our four-legged friends and the people who love them.
