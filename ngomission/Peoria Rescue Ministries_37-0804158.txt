In the past fifty years Peoria Rescue Ministries has grown from doughnuts and coffee on the street to serving men, women, and children in our community in five different facilities. Peoria Rescue Mission is a residential program ministering to the physical, spiritual, and emotional needs of hurting men. Victory Acres, a farm in rural Peoria County, seeks to help men find a productive Christian lifestyle as they deal with alcohol and substance abuse. The Women's Pregnancy Center was opened to minister to the needs of women who experience an unplanned pregnancies or post-abortion trauma. At Barnabas Center caring, trained counselors offer free Biblical counseling to scores of clients of all ages. The need for an in-house, long-term facility for women and women with children was met when Esther House was opened.
