The University of Delaware (UD) began as a small private academy in 1743, and has grown to the research-intensive, technologically advanced institution of today. UD exists to cultivate learning, develop knowledge and foster the free exchange of ideas. State-assisted yet privately governed, the University has a strong tradition of distinguished scholarship, research, teaching and service that is grounded in a commitment to increasing and disseminating scientific, humanistic and social knowledge for the benefit of the larger society. UD offers courses in a broad range of disciplines, and our student body includes nearly 16,000 undergraduates, 3,500 graduate students, and 1,000 students in professional and continuing studies.
