The David Horowitz Freedom Center was founded in 1988 as the Center for the Study of Popular Culture to establish a conservative presence in Hollywood and show how popular culture had become a political battleground. The mission of the Center is to defend America's free society through educating the public to preserve traditional constitutional values of: individual freedom, rule of law, private property, and limited government. The Center has established programs such as The Wednesday Morning Club, the Individual Rights Foundation, and Students for Academic Freedom. Additionally, the Center publishes FrontPage Magazine, an online journal of news and political commentary.
