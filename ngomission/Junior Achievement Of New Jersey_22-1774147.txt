Junior Achievement of New Jersey is dedicated to educating young people about business, economics and free enterprise. Through a dedicated volunteer network, Junior Achievement of New Jersey offers in-school and after-school programs for students in grades K-12. Our comprehensive curriculum, developed in partnership with educators, reinforces and supplements NJ's core curriculum standards from kindergarten through high school. JA programs focus on seven key content areas: business, citizenship, economics, entrepreneurship, ethics/character, financial literacy, and career development.
