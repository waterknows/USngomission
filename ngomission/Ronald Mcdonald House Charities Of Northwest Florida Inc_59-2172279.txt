Since opening in 1984, Ronald McDonald House Charities of Northwest Florida has served as a home-away-from-home and source of respite and resources for more than 20,000 adults and children. Originally built as a 6-bedroom facility, we underwent 2 expansions before opening a brand new 26-bedroom House at 5200 Bayou Boulevard in Pensacola, Florida on August 23, 2010. This larger facility allows us to serve over 1,000 families each year.
