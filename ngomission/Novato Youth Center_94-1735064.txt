Since 1976, the Novato Youth Center has offered programs to youth and their families in the community. Our mission is to inspire and prepare youth to succeed. We accomplish this by supporting their development in: academics and learning; health and well being; personal enrichment through arts and athletics; and social interaction and community engagement. Our 14 programs and services are offered in our 23,000 sq. ft. main facility, on school campuses, and at the Novato Wellness Center. Programs include: early childhood education, school age childcare, youth and family counseling, Novato Wellness Center, and Vibrant Novato.
