The National Women's History Museum (NWHM), founded in 1996, is a nonpartisan educational institution dedicated to preserving, interpreting, and celebrating the diverse historic contributions of women, and integrating this rich heritage fully into our nation's history. Our mission is to build the first ever national museum in Washington, D.C., dedicated exclusively to women's history. It will be centrally located near the world's most prestigious museums and monuments in our Nation's Capital. Until legislation passes in Congress designating a permanent museum in Washington, D.C., the NWHM promotes women's history through its temporary exhibits, special events, Cyber Museum, and online educational materials.
