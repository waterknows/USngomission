Hagley Museum and Library collects, preserves, and interprets the unfolding history of American enterprise. It is located on the site of the gunpowder works founded by E. I. du Pont in 1802. Hagley's library furthers the study of business and technology in America, especially the Middle Atlantic region. The collections include individuals' papers and companies' records ranging from eighteenth-century merchants to modern telecommunications and illustrate the impact of the business system on society. The Center for the History of Business, Technology, and Society organizes and administers the Hagley Museum and Library's interaction with the world of scholarship. It brings attention to Hagley's research collections and generates intellectual dialogue at Hagley.
