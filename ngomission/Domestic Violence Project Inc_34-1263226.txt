Established in 1978, Domestic Violence Project, Inc. (DVPI) provides safe shelter, legal advocacy, counseling, prevention and educational services for victims, their children and the community. We will not rest until we have in place a complete and effective violence education/prevention/awareness campaign for Stark County students grades pre-K through 12, every person in Stark County is free from abuse, and we use across the County a common message with common terminology about interpersonal violence.
