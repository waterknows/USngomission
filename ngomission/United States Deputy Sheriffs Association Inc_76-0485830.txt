Founded in 1995, the United States Deputy Sheriffs' Association (USDSA) awards needed equipment, free of charge, to mostly rural, underfunded county law enforcement agencies. Our provided services include: emergency disaster relief of $2,000 to members killed in the line of duty; members may attend defensive tactics or tactical entry seminars; and we award equipment to departments who need it. Equipment is typically in the form of bulletproof vests, camcorders and general officer safety items.
