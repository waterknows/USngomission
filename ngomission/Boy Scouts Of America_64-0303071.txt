The Boy Scouts of America, Andrew Jackson Council operates numerous activities to reach students of all ages. We promote the ability of boys to become self reliant and helpful to others, train them in scoutcraft and teach them patriotism, courage and other virtues. Our programs include traditional Cub and Boy Scout units, but today Scouting extends much further than it used to. Today's Scouting experience offers a more broad, hands on approach to learning. Programs such as Exploring, Venturing, and Learning for Life offer co-ed participation and a wide reach into our communities. The Council serves 21,000 youth annually in 22 counties of Central and Southwest Mississippi.
