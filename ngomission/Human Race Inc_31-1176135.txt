The Human Race Theatre Company is the Dayton region's professional regional theatre company. As our name suggests, we present universal themes that explore the human condition and startle us all into a renewed awareness of ourselves. As the primary professional producing theatre in the Miami Valley, we will continue to be the gateway for theatre professionals with a national presence to share their talents with our community.
