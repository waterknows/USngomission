The Tariq Khamisa Foundation (TKF) was established in 1995 after Tariq Khamisa, a 20 year old college student was killed by Tony Hicks, a 14 year old gang member. Our goal is to stop youth violence through our education, mentorship, and community service programs. TKF has designed its services to support youth in reducing their risk for negative behaviors such as violence, delinquency, school failure, and gang involvement. Our methodology is based on restorative principles that create opportunities for growth regardless of one's actions or behaviors. Interventions are conducted for all students with individualized services for those most prone to violence.
