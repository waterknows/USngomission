The mission of Mississippi Children's Museum is to provide unparalleled experiences that ignite a thirst for discovery, knowledge, and learning in all children. The museum accomplishes this mission through hands-on and engaging exhibits and programs focusing on literacy, the arts, science, health and nutrition - the keys to helping our children mature into healthy and productive adult learners. We want to inspire Mississippi's children from all backgrounds to discover and achieve their potential. We are invested in our state's greatest resource, its children.
