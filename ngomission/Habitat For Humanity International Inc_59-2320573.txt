Habitat for Humanity of Broward County is a nondenominational Christian housing ministry dedicated to eradicating substandard housing by building simple, decent, affordable homes in partnership with low and very-low income families in need. Our broader mission is to improve the lives of these families through the power of partnership, education and support, thereby transforming the community. Habitat for Humanity is founded on the conviction that every man, woman and child should have a simple, decent, affordable place to live in dignity and safety. Since its inception in 1983, Habitat for Humanity of Broward County has built more than 270 homes in partnership with families in need.
