The Boston Minuteman Council serves over 8,000 youth in the City of Boston and 32 additional cities and towns within Greater Boston. The council is divided into three districts: Lintlock District, Sons of Liberty District, and Great Blue Hill District. We promote the ability of youth to do things for themselves and others, to train them in scout craft, and to teach them patriotism, courage, self-reliance, and kindred virtues. This is done though activities, organization, and cooperation.
