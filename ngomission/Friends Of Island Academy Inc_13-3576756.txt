Friends was founded in 1990 at the alternative high school on Rikers Island - known then as Island Academy. Rooted in collaboration between committed education and social service staff, we sought to address the recidivism rates, untapped potential, and minority over-representation among adolescents who attended school on Rikers Island. Our services have broadened over time, but our core mission remains the same. Adolescents as young as 16 are prosecuted as adults in New York's criminal justice system. About 800 per year attend school while they are serving sentences in jail, and they represent the pool in which we focus our efforts. Ten years ago, we expanded our services in order to break intergenerational cycles of incarceration by providing support to fathers. Our Friends 2 Fathers program provides services to noncustodial fathers in order to improve parenting skills, address domestic violence and anger management issues, and facilitate employment and child support.
