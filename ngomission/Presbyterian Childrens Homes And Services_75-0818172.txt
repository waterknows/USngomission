Since its beginnings in 1903 as an orphanage in Dallas, Presbyterian Children's Homes and Services has been providing residential care and other services to children and families with no place else to turn. Whether it's through one of our group homes, a foster home, our child and family program, or the advanced education and aftercare program, we do all we can to help show the children in our care that they are beloved children of God. We serve children age birth to 17 who have suffered from neglect, abuse and abandonment, or children whose families are experiencing some type of crisis, such as the death of a parent, divorce, illness, violence, homelessness, parental drug/alcohol abuse and other issues that threaten family stability.
