Founded in 1867, Lewis & Clark College (L&C) is a private institution with a public conscience, a residential campus with global reach. Students and faculty throughout all three of Lewis & Clark's schools - the College of Arts and Sciences, the Graduate School of Education and Counseling, and the Law School - pursue new ways of knowing by combining classic liberal learning with pioneering collaboration. Our students represent the next generation of global thinkers and leaders, unafraid to discard conventional thinking, civic complacency, and outmoded preconceptions. Yet they value what Lewis & Clark offers: an education built from the time-tested elements of careful study, original research, and spirited debate.
