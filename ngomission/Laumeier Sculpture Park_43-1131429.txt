Founded in 1977, Laumeier Sculpture Park is a living laboratory where artists and audiences explore the relationship between contemporary art and the natural environment. We provide high-quality learning experiences for the greater St. Louis community and for visitors from all over the world. The many changing exhibitions, concerts, educational programs, lectures and special events developed at Laumeier Sculpture Park support the mission of the institution.
