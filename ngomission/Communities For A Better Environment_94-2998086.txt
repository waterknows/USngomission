Communities for a Better Environment (CBE) is a social justice organization with a focus on environmental health and justice. CBE works to achieve environmental health and justice by building grassroots power in and with communities of color and working-class communities. We organize in working class communities of color because those communities suffer the most from environmental pollution and toxics. We provide community residents who want to challenge corporate polluters with organizing help, scientific and policy research, and legal assistance. The focus of our work is to help community members identify their own problems, and define their own campaigns and solutions.
