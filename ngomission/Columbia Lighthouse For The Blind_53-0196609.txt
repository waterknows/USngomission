Since 1900, Columbia Lighthouse for the Blind (CLB) has been dedicated to helping the blind or visually impaired population of the greater Washington region overcome the challenges of vision loss. Our work enables people of all ages who are blind or visually impaired to remain independent, active and productive in society. CLB provides programs and services to people of all ages who are blind or visually impaired, regardless of their ability to pay. Programs and services include adaptive technology, professional and career services training, low vision services, rehabilitation, counseling, children's services, independent living and older adult programs.
