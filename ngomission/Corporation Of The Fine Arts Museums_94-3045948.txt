The Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco (FAMSF) is the city's largest public arts institution. Comprising the de Young Museum and the Legion of Honor, FAMSF is also the city's most successful public/private partnership. Although a designated city department, most of the Museum's operational funding and all funding for art acquisitions and exhibitions are raised privately. The Legion of Honor displays an impressive collection of 4,000 years of ancient and European art in an unforgettable setting overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge. The de Young Museum, re-opened in October 2005, houses priceless collections of American art from the 17th through the 20th centuries, and art of the native Americas, Africa, and the Pacific.
