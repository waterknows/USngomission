Higher Achievement was founded in 1975 by Greg Gannon, a teacher at Gonzaga College High School in Washington, DC. Higher Achievement closes the opportunity gap during the pivotal middle school years. By leveraging the power of communities, Higher Achievement's proven model provides a rigorous year-round out-of-school-time learning environment, caring role models, and a culture of high expectations, resulting in college-bound scholars with the character, confidence, and skills to succeed. Over the past 35 years, Higher Achievement has worked with more than 10,000 youth in the DC Metro area. On average, 95 percent of Higher Achievement scholars advance to top academic high schools and 93 percent go on to college.
