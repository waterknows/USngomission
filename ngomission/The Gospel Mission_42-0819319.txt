Since 1938, The Gospel Mission in Sioux City has been a lighthouse for the homeless, the downtrodden, the poor and the needy. We relocated to 500 Bluff Street in 2009 and with the Lord's blessing, the $1.8M mortgage is now paid in full, just as our sins have been paid in full by our Savior.The Gospel is at the core of our name as well as our ministry. Chapel services are provided by partnering churches, youth groups, lay leaders and Mission staff and are required for overnight guests. The goal of the Mission is to utilize the resources we have to lead our guests into a relationship with our Savior. The Mission offers a life skills program as one such resource for our guests who wish to improve themselves spiritually, socially, and vocationally.For 2012, we served 369 meals/day, provided 76 beds/night, assisted our guests in finding 115 day-jobs/week, gave away $1229/week from our thrift store, helped 126 families/week with food baskets, and distributed 38 bibles/month to our guests.
