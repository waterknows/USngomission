Play is not a luxury; it is a tool for education and health. It can bring entire communities together and inspire every individual. A game of football can teach children about tolerance and peace, a game of tag can teach about malaria. Our mission at Right To Play is to use sport and play to educate and empower children and youth to overcome the effects of poverty, conflict, and disease in disadvantaged communities. Our vision is create a healthier and safer world through the power of sport and play. Right To Play's values reflect the best practices of sport and play: co-operation, hope, integrity, leadership, dedication, respect, enthusiasm, and nurture.
