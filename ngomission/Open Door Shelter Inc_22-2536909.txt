Our mission is to effectively address the causes and complexities of the homeless and working poor by providing shelter, food, clothing, case management services, treatment services, transitional planning for short and long term goals, subsidized housing, education, employment, and a path towards independence and success. We provide shelter nightly with over 95 beds in our facility and we operate the Manna House kitchen and pantry, which provides approximately 60,000 meals per month to individuals and families in our community. In 2010, we launched Hope Works, a job training program intended to get at the root cause of homelessness: unemployment. This program combines job training, computer training, life skills coaching as well as job placement services to help residents get back to a life of independence and self-reliance.
