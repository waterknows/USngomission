Founded in 1977, the Ocean Institute works to inspire all generations through education to become responsible stewards for our oceans. The Ocean Institute has become nationally known for its hands-on marine science, environmental education and maritime history programs. More than 110,000 K-12 students and 6,000 teachers annually participate in the Institute's 61 award-winning, immersion style programs. We are an educational facility specializing in innovative marine and social science programs. To learn maritime history and literature, students spend an entire night aboard the brig Pilgrim - each student hauling lines, hoisting sails, standing night watch and swabbing decks. Our vision is to be the world's best experiential ocean educational organization.
