Faith and Action is a Christian outreach to top-level government officials located in Washington, DC, throughout the United States and around the world. Our purpose is to challenge the minds and consciences of public policy makers with the mandate given by Christ in the two Great Commandments: Love God With All Your Heart, Soul, Mind and Strength, and Love Your Neighbor As Yourself.
