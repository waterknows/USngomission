The Legal Aid Society - Employment Law Center (LAS-ELC), opened its doors for business in 1916. Today, LAS-ELC promotes the stability of low income and disadvantaged workers and their families by addressing issues that affect their ability to achieve self-sufficiency. Using the law as a tool, the LAS-ELC helps workers attain financial security by preserving employment opportunities. We believe that stable working conditions and adequate income strengthen families and build communities. By protecting the legitimate employment status of wage earners, we provide families the means to pull through adverse times, avoid the downward spiral caused by job loss, and be fully contributing members of society.
