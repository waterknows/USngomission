The mission of the United Way of the Ohio Valley is to unite the citizens of our partnership communities into an organized effort to provide funds to meet current and emerging human service needs that are best provided through the voluntary sector. The United Way of the Ohio Valley is a regional organization of people striving to advance the common good by focusing on Education, Income and Health. These are the building blocks for a good life - a quality education that leads to a stable job, enough income to support a family through retirement and good health. Our goal is to create long-lasting changes that prevent problems from happening in the first place.
