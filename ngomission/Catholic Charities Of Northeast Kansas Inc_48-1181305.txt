Founded in 1956, Catholic Charities of Northeast Kansas provides a wide range of programs and services to those in need in our 21 county service area. We believe in offering our neighbors in need a hand up, not a hand out by giving them the help and resources needed for long-term change. Our vision is to help our neighbors who are challenged by poverty of mind, body and spirit find the open door of Catholic Charities in our communities and are met with help, hospitality and hope. As a faith-based organization, we are inspired by God's love and compassion to provide unconditional love and necessary help to people of all faiths by stabilizing and strengthening individuals and families in need across Northeast Kansas.
