The Institute for Creation Research (ICR) was first established in 1970 as the research division of Christian Heritage College. ICR was reorganized with its present name in 1972. From the beginning, ICR's has focused on research, communication, and education in those fields of science particularly relevant to the study of origins. ICR equips believers with evidences of the Bible's accuracy and authority through scientific research, educational programs, and media presentations, all conducted within a thoroughly biblical framework. In June 2006, ICR's board of directors formally approved the establishment of the Henry M. Morris Center for Christian Leadership in Dallas, Texas. The goal of the center is to expand the impact of ICR's various ministries. In June 2007, ICR's headquarters officially relocated to Dallas.
