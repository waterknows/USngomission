The Child Advocates San Antonio (CASA) was founded in 1984 by the National Council of Jewish Women to serve children in Bexar County. The mission of CASA is to recruit, train, and supervise court-appointed volunteer Advocates who provide constancy for abused and neglected children and youth while advocating for services and placement in safe and permanent homes. The efforts of CASA's volunteer Advocates help ensure Bexar County's foster children are receiving the necessary medical, developmental and educational attention they need.
