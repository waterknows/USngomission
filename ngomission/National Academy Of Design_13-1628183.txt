The National Academy Museum and School of Fine Arts is a tripartite institution. It is an honorary association of American artists with a museum and a school of fine arts. Founded in 1825 as the National Academy of Design by such leading artists as Samuel F. B. Morse, Asher B. Durand, and Thomas Cole to promote the fine arts in America through instruction and exhibition, the Academy continues to play a critical role in preserving and fostering the visual arts in America. Through a program of exceptional exhibitions in the Museum and quality instruction in the School of Fine Arts, the Academy serves as a link to the art of our past, as well as a bridge to the art of our present and future.
