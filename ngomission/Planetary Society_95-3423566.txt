The Planetary Society, founded in 1980 by Carl Sagan, Bruce Murray, and Louis Friedman, inspires and involves the world's public in space exploration through advocacy, projects, and education. Today, The Planetary Society is the largest and most influential public space organization group on Earth and is dedicated to exploring the solar system and seeking life beyond Earth. The Planetary Society leads by example: through private ventures, such as the solar sail; through public-private partnerships, such as the Mars Microphone; through promoting grand and ambitious adventures, such as human missions to Mars. We continue to find more ways for members of the public to participate directly in humanity's evolution into a multi-planet species - as we inspire the people of Earth to explore other worlds and seek other life.
