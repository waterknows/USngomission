The Taubman Museum of Art was founded in 1951. As a center for the visual arts, we encourage a free exchange between the making of art, the display of art and the interpretation of art. Our programs endeavor to explore creativity from inspiration to presentation with the goal of engaging and intriguing our audiences. An art center encompasses the functions of an art museum but is broader in scope and more of a hybrid non-profit, permanent cultural institution. The collections form one of many equivalent cores around which exhibitions and educational programs are organized. There is however, equanimity between exhibitions, collections, lectures performance, film and video, seminars, symposia, conversations, and other forms of presentation. It is the ideas and experiences, educational initiatives and learning environments, and community engagement and collaboration that form the core of the art center.
