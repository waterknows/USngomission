The Oklahoma Institute for Child Advocacy (OICA) works to create awareness, take action and change policy to improve the health, safety and well-being of Oklahoma's children. OICA fights for policies that improve the lives of children and families by being their voice at the State Capitol and in the communities where they live and learn. For three decades, the Institute has informed and educated state policymakers and other citizens on the importance of investing wisely in children and families.
