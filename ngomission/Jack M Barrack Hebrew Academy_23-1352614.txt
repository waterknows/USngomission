Founded in 1946 as Akiba Hebrew Academy, Jack M. Barrack Hebrew Academy is the oldest pluralistic Jewish day school in North America. The founders envisioned a school where Jewish adolescents would experience a dual curriculum of secular and Jewish studies; prepare for leadership roles in the Jewish community and the community at large; and come together to study their common heritage, living Jewish values in a pluralistic and mutually respectful setting. A Barrack Hebrew Academy education uniquely prepares students to find and take their place as knowledgeable citizens and informed leaders in school, in college, in the community and in the world at large.
