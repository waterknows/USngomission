Go Ye Fellowship's mission is to enable cross-cultural Christian workers to carry out the specific call and vision God has given them. Our vision is to advance Christ's global mandate to make disciples of all peoples. As disciples are made they will join or form vital, reproducing, indigenous fellowships. Their transformed lives will steadily exert a transforming impact on their culture toward righteousness, justice, productivity, and mercy. Our missionaries advance the Great Commission worldwide in a great variety of ways: evangelism, teaching, church planting, discipleship and through media, medical care, orphanages, correspondence courses, Bible schools, development, literature, translation, tent making.
