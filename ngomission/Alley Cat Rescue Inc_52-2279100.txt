Alley Cat Rescue (ACR) works to protect cats on several levels: locally through rescue, rehabilitation and adoption of cats and nationally through a network of Cat Action Teams, called CAT. ACR is dedicated to the health, well-being and welfare of all cats: domestic, stray, abandoned and feral. ACR is helping to solve the crisis and tragedy of unwanted and abandoned cats. We are saving lives with innovative hands-on programs; we have rescued thousands of cats and placed them in loving homes; we assist with all aspects of feral cat care, wildlife predation and rabies control; and we also provide information on cat health, cat behavior, feline diseases, and special needs.
