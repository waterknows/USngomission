The Colorado I Have a DreamÂ® Foundation (CIHADF) helps Denver's most at-risk youth achieve their dreams through an award-winning, 12-year program of mentoring, academic assistance, life-skills development, cultural enrichment and partial scholarships for higher education. The seeds of failure take root on our inner city streets: poverty, drugs, violence, hunger, crime, underperforming schools, language barriers, whole neighborhoods disenfranchised. Through it all, or perhaps in spite of it, our children dream.
