Safe Haven Family Shelter empowers Middle Tennessee homeless families with children to achieve lasting self-sufficiency. We are a shelter-to-housing program which accepts entire homeless families and provides comprehensive services. As our name implies, we have an emergency shelter program, but we also offer a Transitional Housing Program and Rapid Rehousing Program. Safe Haven Family Shelter's comprehensive approach is one of service, compassion, trauma-informed care and evidenced-bases practices.
