Rock in Prevention helps children, teachers and parents learn the methods and skills to prevent bullying and drug use through music with our Rock workshops. Since 1990, Rock in Prevention has helped more than 1.5 million students and parents. Today, Rock In Prevention is excited about making new discoveries and will continue to connect the dots of increasing parental involvement, student supports, guidance, literacy and the academic goals of schools to help children live to their fullest potential.
