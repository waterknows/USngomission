Founded in 1983 by Dr. Gene E. Likens, the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies is a leader in applying the ecosystem approach to some of society's most pressing problems, from the quantity and quality of freshwater resources to the health of our forests. The Institute is dedicated to the creation, dissemination and application of knowledge about ecological systems. This knowledge is created through scientific research, disseminated through teaching, writing, and exhibits, and applied through participation in decision-making regarding the ecological management of natural resources and through promotion of a broader awareness about the importance of ecological relationships to human welfare.
