The Neurosciences Institute is a scientific research organization dedicated to learning about the brain for the benefit of mankind. The Institute focuses its research on the principles underlying how we perceive and act upon the world, how we learn and remember, and how consciousness arises. Researchers at the Institute work in a collaborative environment to create large-scale spiking models of the mammalian nervous system. Using an approach called synthetic neural modeling, they explore how neuronal connectivity and physiology interact to produce observable neural activity and behavior. The overall goal is to better understand the biological bases of perception, motor control, memory, cognition, and, ultimately, consciousness itself.
