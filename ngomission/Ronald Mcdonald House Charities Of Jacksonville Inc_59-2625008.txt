The Ronald McDonald House of Jacksonville offers support to critically ill, chronically ill and seriously injured children and their families. We are a home away from home for children and their families. We offer a sense of community, compassion and service in support of any family whose child receives medical care in Jacksonville, regardless of their ability to pay. Since opening in 1988 the House has offered support and temporary lodging to 25,000 families while their sick or injured children receive medical care in our city's excellent pediatric specialty facilities.
