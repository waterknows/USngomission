Officers' Christian Fellowship's (OCF) purpose is to glorify God by uniting Christian officers for biblical fellowship and outreach, equipping and encouraging them to minister effectively in the military society. OCF desires to serve those who serve their country. OCF serves active duty officers, enlisted personnel, guard and reserve members, academy and ROTC cadets/midshipmen, international military personnel, civilian employees of the military, retirees, widows, and their families. We have a number of resources to help military members and their families grow together in their relationship with God and others.
