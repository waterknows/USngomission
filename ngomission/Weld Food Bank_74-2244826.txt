Weld Food Bank's (WFB) mission is to lead and engage our community in the fight against hunger. WFB collects, stores, and processes food to distribute it to low-income people. We glean food from manufacturers, farmers, distributors, grocers and community food drives in order to make it available to hungry people in our community. We are an affiliate of Feeding America, the largest hunger relief organization in the United States.
