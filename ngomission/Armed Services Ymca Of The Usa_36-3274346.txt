Mission:The Armed Services YMCA enhances the lives of military members and their families in spirit, mind and body through programs relevant to the unique challenges of military life.The mission is carried out in cooperation with the military. For more than 150 years, the Armed Services YMCA has been making military life easier for our Troops and their Families. Whether they are single, married, Active, Guard or Reserve, it's all about them and providing them a quality of life commensurate with their service to the Nation. Today, in close partnership with senior military leaders, the focus of our low/no-cost programs and services is on the young, Junior Enlisted Troops and Families, as they are the ones most in need.
