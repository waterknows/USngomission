Established in 1988, Mary's Center for Maternal and Child Care works to build better futures through the delivery of health care, education and social services. We embrace our culturally diverse community and provide the highest quality care regardless of ability to pay. Mary's Center demonstrates how improved access to family medical care, supportive and family literacy services lead to healthy families and safe communities. In addition, through its numerous programs the Center provides dynamic child development services, intensive home visits for pregnant women and their infants, case management for teen pregnancy prevention, and educational training to prevent school dropout.
