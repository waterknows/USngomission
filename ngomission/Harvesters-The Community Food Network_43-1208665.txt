Harvesters - The Community Food Network is the regional food bank serving Kansas City, Topeka, and the surrounding area. Our mission is to feed hungry people today and to end hunger tomorrow. As a clearinghouse for the collection and distribution of food and related household products, we've been helping people in need since 1979 by: collecting food and household products from community and industry sources; distributing those products and providing nutrition services through a network of not-for-profit agencies; offering leadership and education programs to increase community awareness of hunger and generate solutions to end hunger. Our network includes more than 620 not-for-profit agencies throughout our 26-county service area, including emergency food pantries, soup kitchens, homeless shelters, children's homes, homes for the mentally disabled and shelters for battered persons.
