Help From People to People was founded in 1973, with the mission to help our neighbors through difficult times with dignity. Since then our core purpose has been simply to ensure that no one in Rockland County goes to bed hungry. For decades, we have been known as the charity with a heart - we listen, we hear and we respond to our neighbors in need. Through programs developed to help individuals break the cycle of poverty and address the challenges in their lives, Help From People to People is helping our most vulnerable neighbors turn their lives around, emerging as self-sufficient and contributing members of our community. That translates into a better quality of life for all of us.
