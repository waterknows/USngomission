The Sarasota Opera began producing operas in 1974 as the Asolo Opera Guild; today, it continues to produce opera true to the vision of the composer to entertain, enrich, and educate our communities, as well as patrons from across the state and around the world. An internationally respected producer of the highest quality professional opera, it fosters artistic excellence, diversity, and vitality in the Sarasota area by producing opera as a living art form through performances and composition; offering a stage for American-trained principal artists; producing high-caliber Apprentice and Studio Artist programs; owning, maintaining, and operating the Opera House as a year-round facility; and promoting and increasing public knowledge and appreciation of opera.
