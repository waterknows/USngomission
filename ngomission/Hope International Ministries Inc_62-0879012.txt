Founded in 1968, Hope Children's Home has rescued nearly 5,000 children 2-18. Most of these children have been discarded, abused, unwanted, or orphaned. Some of them have faced life situations that left them a little off track. Our purpose at Hope Children's home is to share Christ with the children and mold them into Biblically educated members of our future society. For over 47 years, Hope Children's Home has taken children in and tried to make a difference in their very impressionable lives. We feel that God has called us to help rebuild the broken lives of these children and to build the bridge, when possible, between home, parent, and child.
