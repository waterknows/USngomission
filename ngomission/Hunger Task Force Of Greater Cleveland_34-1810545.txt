The Hunger Network of Greater Cleveland is Cuyahoga County's largest and most effective direct emergency food distribution network. Each month, we place nutritious meals directly into the hands of 60,000 people, more than 40% of which are children. Our nearly 100 hunger centers consists of pantries and hotel meal sites that purchase food from local food bank warehouses and operate with the help of 1,400 dedicated volunteers.We serve more than 6.5 million meals a year to Clevelanders in need. Our cause is not hunger - it is people, their potential and their quality of life. What we do improves wellness and well-being. Hungry children cannot grow or learn to their full potential. Hungry adults cannot work. No one does more with a dollar. We are able to provide 4 nutritious meals in our hunger centers for every $1 donated to the Hunger Network. Every Clevelander deserves a place at the table. A place at our table means access - access to nourishment, wellness, community and influence.
