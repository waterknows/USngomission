Founded in 1972, the Churchill School is a K-12 school of approximately 400 students that educates children with learning disabilities. Our mission is to educate children with learning disabilities in a comprehensive full-day program that, with appropriate accommodations, gives students full access to a general education curriculum. Through a program designed to stimulate intellectual curiosity, identify and use students' strengths and expand their knowledge, our students strive to acquire the essential academic and social skills expected of all students in New York. The Churchill Center offers educational programs and professional development in the field of learning disabilities to students, parents, teachers and related service providers.
