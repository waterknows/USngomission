Bonfils Blood Center Foundation was established in 1995 as the fundraising arm of Bonfils Blood Center and serves the core function of encouraging and managing philanthropy to support a variety of programs and initiatives for Bonfils Blood Center. Opened in 1943, Bonfils Blood Center has become an important part of the healthcare system throughout Colorado. Our headquarters are in Denver in the Lowry redevelopment area and we have nearly 400 employees who work at Bonfils each day to make a difference in our community. It now operates six community donor centers, serves nearly 200 healthcare facilities in Colorado and beyond, collects nearly 154,000 units of blood annually and offers a variety of services to better meet the needs of the community, including the Colorado Marrow Donor Program.
