Founded in 1978, the National Veterans Services Fund, Inc. (NVSF), formerly Vietnam Veterans Agent Orange Victims, provides case-managed social services and limited medical assistance to Vietnam- and Persian Gulf War- veterans and their families, with a focus on families with disabled children. The families served by NVSF have been unable to obtain the social and health services they so critically need from other sources. NVSF uniquely combines family-guided case management (service coordination) and advocacy assistance while strengthening business, social and community support. Services provided by NVSF are carefully designed to empower families so that they can successfully navigate different health and social systems.
