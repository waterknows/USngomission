After-School All-Stars provides comprehensive after-school programs that keep children safe and help them succeed in school and life. For more than 20 years, we have offered free, high-quality programs to at-risk youth across the country. Our goals for our All-Stars are that they grow up safe and healthy, graduate high school and go on to college, find careers they love and give back to their communities. We achieve these goals by fueling our students' passions, tying their interests to academic support, enrichment activities and health and fitness programs that instill the confidence and resilience they'll need for success in school and in life. At ASAS, learning is disguised in hands-on, student-directed projects that engage students' imaginations and extend the classroom to their playing fields, neighborhoods, and homes. We help our All-Stars gain the confidence and skills they need to lead their communities.
