The Council for Secular Humanism is North America's leading organization for non-religious people. An educational association, the Council supports a wide range of activities to meet the needs of people who find meaning and value in life without looking to a god. Its activities range from magazine publishing to campaigning on ethical issues, from conferences to support networks, from educational courses to conducting secular ceremonies, from local groups to international development. Council activities include championing the rights and beliefs of secular humanists; serving the needs of non-religious people; developing secular communities; and giving a moral and intellectual lead.
