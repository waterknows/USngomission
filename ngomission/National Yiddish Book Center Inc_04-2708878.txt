The Yiddish Book Center is a non-profit organization working to recover Yiddish books and other Jewish treasures and to advance understanding of the history, literature and culture they represent. Our major initiatives include onsite and online education; an online library to make Yiddish books, audio and video freely available to all; and publications and outreach, including a visitors center, exhibitions, public programs, translation, oral history, an English-language magazine, social media and campus events.
