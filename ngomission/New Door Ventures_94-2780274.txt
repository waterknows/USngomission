New Door Ventures helps at-risk youth get ready for work and life. Through real opportunities to work and learn, we provide assistance to young people ages 16-21 who need support in making the increasingly difficult transition to adulthood. We provide youth with the meaningful jobs and training that they need to succeed in the workplace, and the personal support they need for the rest of life. We offer a comprehensive approach to helping youth succeed through: jobs, job readiness, supportive community.
