Since 1956 Guest House has worked to provide the information, education, treatment and care needed to ensure that clergy, men and women religious, and seminarians suffering from alcoholism and other chemically-based or process addictions have the best opportunity for quality recovery. Since its beginning, Guest House has cared for more than 8,000 priests and religious. They have come from more than 165 dioceses, 120 religious communities and 48 countries worldwide. The vast majority have returned to their ministries renewed in health, purpose and spirituality. Today, 2,000 Guest House graduates minister worldwide. A second mission of Guest House is the provision of education to Church leadership, seminarians and other interested publics regarding addiction diseases, recovery and sobriety and the spiritual aspects of these.
