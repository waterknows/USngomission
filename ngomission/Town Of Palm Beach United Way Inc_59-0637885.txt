The Palm Beach Community Chest was founded in 1945, by a group of concerned citizens in Palm Beach for the purpose of raising and distributing funds to charitable organizations. In 2006, we changed our name to the Town of Palm Beach United Way, and for more than 69 years, our purpose has remained constant. We are dedicated to improving people's lives for the better and making our community stronger. We help advance the common good for those in need throughout Palm Beach County by focusing on programs and priorities that promote education, income and health - the building blocks for a good life. The mission of the Town of Palm Beach United Way is to help people, community wide, and improve their quality of life.
