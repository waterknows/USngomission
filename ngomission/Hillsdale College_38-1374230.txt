Founded in 1844, Hillsdale College is an independent, coeducational, residential, liberal arts college with a student body of about 1,300. Its four-year curriculum leads to the bachelor of arts or bachelor of science degree, and it is accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. Hillsdale's educational mission rests upon two principles: academic excellence and institutional independence. Located in rural southern Michigan, the nearly 200-acre Hillsdale campus includes both modern and historic buildings.
