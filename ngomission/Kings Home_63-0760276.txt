Founded in 1977, King's Home has been home to hundreds of youth, women, and children seeking refuge, hope, and help from abuse, neglect, abandonment, homelessness, and other difficult circumstances. It is a place where compassion resides, where love dwells, and where hope lives. King's Home operates 18 Christ-centered therapeutic group homes and independent-living facilities in three counties. They teach necessary life skills and provide tangible services to help their residents heal from their devastating pasts, break the cycle of abuse, build healthy relationships and become independent, productive members of their community. Services are available without regard to race, creed, age, national origin, marital status, sexual orientation, handicap, or religion.
