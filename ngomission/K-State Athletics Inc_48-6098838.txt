The objective of the Intercollegiate Athletic Council of Kansas State University is to promote and support intercollegiate athletics allowing Kansas State University to compete as strongly as possible, within the Big Twelve Conference, and any other athletic conference with which the University may affiliate. It is our responsibility to create through proper leadership and atmosphere an environment which provides the student athlete with an opportunity to acquire an education and to achieve at least an undergraduate degree. We must strive to develop intellectual, social, moral, emotional, cultural, and vocational growth and development as well as physical.
