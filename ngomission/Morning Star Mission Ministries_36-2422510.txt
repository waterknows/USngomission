MorningStar Mission Ministries is a non-denominational organization dedicated to relieving the spiritual and physical hunger of the poor. We do this by providing food for the hungry, clothing for the needy, shelter for the homeless and the Gospel of Jesus Christ for all. Ministering to men, women, children and entire families, MorningStar Mission has served the less fortunate of Joliet and the surrounding Will County area since 1909. Whether it's through a one-time meal or a long-term recovery program, we're committed to offering hope for the hurting.
