The Gathering Place opened in January 2000 as a community-based cancer support center to fill an unmet need in the greater Cleveland community. The programs and services offered address the social, emotional, physical, and spiritual needs of individuals with cancer and their support network. The mission of The Gathering Place is to support, educate and empower individuals and families touched by cancer through programs and services provided free of charge. The Gathering Place serves all individuals with any type of cancer and their family and friends regardless of age, gender, race, ethnicity, religion, or sexual orientation. The clinical staff are all master's prepared and licensed and provide the highest quality standard of care.
