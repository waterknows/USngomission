The People's City Mission (PCM) has been a vital part of the Lincoln community for over 100 years. We were founded in 1907 by a number of local churches in the city. They wanted to demonstrate Christ's love to people who were impoverished and homeless by providing them with emergency assistance of food, shelter, and clothing. Over the years, our purpose has remained the same: bring the good news of Jesus Christ to the poor and homeless, and demonstrate His love for them by meeting basic human needs. Over the years, more than five hundred thousand people have been assisted by our ministry.
