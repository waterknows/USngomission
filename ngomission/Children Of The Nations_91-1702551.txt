Founded in 1995, Children of the Nations (COTN) provides holistic, Christ-centered care for orphaned and destitute children, enabling them to create positive and lasting change in their nations. Today, COTN is working in the USA, Dominican Republic, Sierra Leone, Malawi, and most recently in Uganda to provide relief for orphaned and destitute children. COTN operates homes, schools, farms, skill centers, clinics and village feeding centers in an effort to give quality care to our children. From the initial desire to rescue children from their despair, to today creating a family for each child, COTN has come so far. Today, over 26,000 children are learning to be leaders for tomorrow.
