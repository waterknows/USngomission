With roots tracing to 1924, Hidden Villa is an educational organization that uses its organic farm, wilderness, and community to teach and provide opportunities to learn about the environment and social justice. Hidden Villa stretches over 1,600 acres of open space in the foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains, about 40 miles south of San Francisco. Our mission is to inspire a just and sustainable future through our programs, land and legacy. Every year 30,000 people participate in one of our formal programs. An additional 20,000 visitors come to our preserve annually to explore our farm and gardens or to hike on our eight miles of trails.
