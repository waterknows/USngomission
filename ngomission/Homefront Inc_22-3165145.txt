Founded in 1998, HomeFront provides a comprehensive network of services for the poor and homeless in Mercer County, New Jersey. HomeFront programs provide emergency shelter and transitional and affordable housing. Our mission is to meet the immediate needs of food, shelter and safety and to help the troubled families break from the cycle of poverty. We work with single mothers, single fathers and families with histories of domestic violence, child abuse, drug abuse and intergenerational welfare. We also work with normal families who just cannot make ends meet in a declining economy. HomeFront programs support education and employment for both children and parents.
