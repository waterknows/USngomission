The North Carolina Museum of Art Foundation works to foster and promote the growth, progress and general welfare of the North Carolina Museum of Art, which houses the art collections of the State of North Carolina. Currently closed for renovations, the Museum's new 127,000-square-foot building will open in April 2010, creating a beautiful home for the permanent collection with dramatically expanded exhibition space highlighted by day-lit galleries. Encompassing 164 acres of fields, woodlands, and creeks, the Museum Park presents a unique setting to explore the intersection between art and nature.
