Incorporated in 1979 as a day program for abused children, The Children's Place at Home Safe has taken the lead in our community by developing the programs and services necessary to respond to the growing needs of children and families. Today Home Safe provides a complete system of care for children who have been sexually, physically and emotionally abused. Our services include foster care and adoption licensing and support, including placement for medically fragile children, therapeutic residential care and the only Specialized Therapeutic Group Care program in Palm Beach County. In keeping with our early founder's vision, Home Safe operates a highly individualized therapeutic Independent Living Program for youth preparing to age out of state to provide individual and group counseling and victims advocacy.
