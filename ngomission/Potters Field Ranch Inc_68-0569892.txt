Potter's Field Ministries works to transform lives forever through "Winning Souls, Feeding the Hungry, and Making Disciples." We accomplish this goal through a multi-faceted ministry that includes Potter's Field Touring Ministries, featuring the presentation by Pastor Michael and Pam Rozell; Potter's Field Kids programs located in Central America and Africa; and the IGNITE Mission Training School in Northwest Montana.
