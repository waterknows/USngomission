Founded in 1995, Tiger Missing Link Foundation (TMLF) works to advance tiger conservation efforts. TMLF has a three-fold expanded mission of tiger conservation, education, and big cat rescue. The Foundation does so too ensure that tigers continue to exist beyond the participation of individual volunteers, to enable contributions towards tiger conservation and big cat rescue efforts. It also provides a vehicle for limiting abuse or neglect of other big cats including the operation of our sanctuary known as Tiger Creek Wildlife Refuge. TMLF conserves genetic diversity and eliminating inbreeding of captive tigers, supporting tiger conservation in-situ, creating public awareness of the tiger's plight, and providing rescue services for big cats who have been abused, neglected, or displaced.
