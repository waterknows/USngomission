Relevant Radio was created in answer to a challenge from our beloved Pope John Paul II. He encouraged American Catholics to seize the means and methods of modern communication to inspire the faithful with a deeper understanding and commitment to Christ and His Church. We exist to assist the Church in this New Evangelization by providing relevant programming through a media platform to help people bridge the gap between faith and everyday life. Since 2000, the network has grown to include 13 stations, with three in the top 16 markets, and over 21 affiliates that carry Relevant Radio programming. Relevant Radio is also available to a worldwide audience via streaming audio or by downloading the mobile app from the App Store. Today, Relevant Radio is the largest Catholic talk radio network in the United States.
