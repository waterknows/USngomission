Community Health Charities of Nebraska is a federation of America's premier health charities that have joined together to raise charitable contributions in the workplace. Employee donations are used to support these member charities and provide research, patient services and outreach in local communities. Employees designate the charity or charities where they want their donations to go, and that's where they go. By partnering with local employers, Community Health Charities of Nebraska connects employees to health and wellness information, volunteer opportunities and the ability to direct donations to the local health charities of their choice. We currently provide access to more than 18 leading charities, encompassing almost every well-known disease or disability and many lesser-known ones.
