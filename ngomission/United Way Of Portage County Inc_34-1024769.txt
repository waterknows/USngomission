United Way of Portage County has been in the life changing business since 1967. United Way of Portage County partners with local agencies (also known as non-profits, not-for-profits, charities) who, in turn, provide services in the areas of health, education and income to Portage County residents. These agencies receive funding from other sources in addition to United Way of Portage County to make these services a reality.
