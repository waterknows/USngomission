The Alliance protects wildlife, wild places, and community character of Jackson Hole by empowering the wHole Community to live in balance with nature.Through a structure of integrating focused issue advocacy campaigns, intentional base building, leadership development, targeted education efforts, and accountability work, we strive to advance an agenda that will create a better future.We lead and engage in issue advocacy campaigns regarding wildlife management, appropriate use of our public lands, wildlife crossings, transportation, and community planning. We develop the next generation of leaders through our Conservation Leadership Institute that empowers participants with the skills and knowledge necessary to hold decision makers accountable. Our Don't Poach the Powder program educates recreationalists about seasonal closures of wildlife habitat, and our Wild Neighborhoods program informs homeowners how to reduce conflicts with wildlife and prepare for wildfires.
