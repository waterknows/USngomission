Having served as the former home of the Seventh Regiment, Park Avenue Armory has transformed into a groundbreaking cultural institution that blurs the boundaries between high art and pop culture. Since 2007, the Armory has organized a series of immersive performances and installations that have drawn critical acclaim and popular attention working independently or collaborating with other cultural institutions. Concurrent with the development of its artistic program, the Armory has undertaken an ongoing revitalization of its historic building, reinvigorating the Armory's original design while stabilizing, preserving, and renewing the building for future generations.
