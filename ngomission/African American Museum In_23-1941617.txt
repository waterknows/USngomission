Founded in 1976, the African American Museum in Philadelphia (AAMP) collects and preserves art and artifacts and, through exhibitions and programs, interprets the history and stories of African Americans and those of the African Diaspora. AAMP enriches the lives of all visitors, especially children and youth, using education to empower them through experiences that will enlighten them culturally and intellectually. It is a gathering place for the community, a forum for broader community engagement and a partner for collaborations with historical and cultural institutions.
