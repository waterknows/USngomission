Founded in 1991, DSW (Deutsche Stiftung Weltbevoelkerung) is an international development and advocacy organisation. Our focus is on achieving universal access to sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR), which is fundamental to improving health and fighting poverty. DSW promotes advocacy dialogue and raise awareness of SRHR issues, and on the linkages between sustainable development, poverty, global health, environmental management, and demographic trends. In addition, we monitor and influence political decision-making in areas relating to SRHR. DSW is partner of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and has consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).
