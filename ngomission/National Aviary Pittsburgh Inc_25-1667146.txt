The National Aviary is America's only independent indoor nonprofit zoo dedicated exclusively to birds. Located in West Park on Pittsburgh's historic North Side, the National Aviary's diverse collection comprises 450 birds representing more than 150 species from around the world, many of them threatened or critically endangered in the wild. The National Aviary's large walk-through exhibits create an experience unlike any other - an intimate, up-close interaction between visitors and free-flying birds, including opportunities to hand-feed and to meet many species rarely found anywhere else in the world. The mission of the National Aviary is to inspire respect for nature through an appreciation of birds.
