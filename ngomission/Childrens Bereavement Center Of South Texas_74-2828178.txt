Founded in 1997, the mission of the Children's Bereavement Center of South Texas (CBCST) is to foster healing for grieving youth, their families and the community through peer support programs, counseling, training, education and outreach. As the sole provider in South Texas of grief support programs for children through young adulthood, we wholeheartedly devote ourselves to addressing the grief and loss needs of children from every culture and social circumstance to help them heal and move forward. CBCST's goal is to help children and their caregivers understand the depth of their grief, stabilize and preserve family relationships, and develop healthy coping skills after the death of a loved one.
