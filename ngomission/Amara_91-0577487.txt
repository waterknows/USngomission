For over 90 years, Amara has been providing services to families and children. Throughout our history we have developed pioneering programs to meet the changing needs of our community's children, youth and families. Our mission is to create and support stable, loving homes for vulnerable children. And our vision and wish for the future is "A Home for Every Child." Amara is an independent, nonprofit in the State of Washington and was formerly known as Medina Children's Services. Amara facilitates between 70 and 90 adoptions annually.
