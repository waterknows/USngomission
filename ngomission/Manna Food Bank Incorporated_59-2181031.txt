Founded in 1982, Manna Food Pantries is a local, grassroots nonprofit organization dedicated to fighting hunger in Escambia & Santa Rosa counties. Our mission is to offer emergency food assistance, service the foodâ€“related needs of vulnerable populations, and engage the entire community in the fight against hunger. We are nonsectarian, community focused and volunteer supported. We believe every person has a right to live free of hunger and to be treated with respect and dignity.
