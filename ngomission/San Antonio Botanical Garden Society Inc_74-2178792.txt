The mission of the San Antonio Botanical Garden society is to inspire people to connect with the plant world and understand the importance of plants in our lives. Community events sponsored by the Botanical Society heighten public awareness of the Botanical Garden. Marketing and public relations efforts further extend the role of the Botanical Society in making the Botanical Garden a compelling attraction for the City of San Antonio.
