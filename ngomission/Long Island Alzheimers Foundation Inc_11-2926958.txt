Founded in 1988, the Long Island Alzheimer's Foundation (LIAF) works to help lighten the burden and improve the quality of life for those suffering with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, their caregivers and their families. Initial efforts included an information hotline, production of the area's first comprehensive resource directory, and a social-model adult day services program. Since then, LIAF's services have mushroomed and our programs are being replicated by other groups to benefit those impacted by Alzheimer's disease. LIAF is regarded as a premier information source and service provider for individuals with dementia and their families, and the healthcare community. The foundation serves the New York metropolitan areas of Nassau, Suffolk, Queens and Brooklyn.
