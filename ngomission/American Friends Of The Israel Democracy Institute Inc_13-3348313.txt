The purpose of American Friends of The Israel Democracy Institute (AFIDI) is to influence public opinion and Israel's decision makers toward the development of a modern, democratic pluralistic Jewish state. The AFIDI supports the Israel Democracy Institute (IDI), founded in 1991 for the purpose of assisting in the important mission of fortifying Israel's democratic institutions and values, still in their formative stages. The IDI is an independent, nonpartisan think tank. The Institute offers politicians and government officials seeking professional and non-affiliated partners a venue for examining ideas and considering practical ways to implement them.
