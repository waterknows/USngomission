In 1983, the Salvadoran American Humanitarian Foundation (SAHF) was formed in the United States as a vehicle to obtain donations of pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and equipment and arrange shipments to El Salvador. SAHF supports programs in Human Development, Health, Education, Nutrition, Housing and Disaster Relief Aid implemented by its in-country sister Foundation, FUSAL, which together with other organizations work to improve the quality of life of the Salvadoran people, especially the most vulnerable, by making use of their potential and strengthening their communities. SAHF/FUSAL mobilize the goodwill, social responsibility and generosity of their benefactors to manage and invest donations in an ethical, professional, effective and efficient manner.
