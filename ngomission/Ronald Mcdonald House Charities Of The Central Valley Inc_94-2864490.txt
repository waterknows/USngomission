Ronald McDonald House Charities of the Central Valley became the fourth house in California that provides a home away from home, a refuge, for families who are trying to cope with the physical, emotional and financial burdens of having a seriously ill child. Parents do not have to sleep in hospital waiting rooms or bear the expense and loneliness of motel lodging. At the House they have an extended family - other house guests - who are experiencing some of the same fears and concerns and who are able to offer emotional support and a sympathetic ear.
