Curamericas Global partners with underserved communities to make measurable and sustainable improvements in their health and well-being. Formerly known as Andean Rural Health Care, Curamericas Global was created in 1983 with the goal of establishing primary health care programs that are responsive to the health needs of the community, improving child survival within the community, and building the national and local capacity of health service providers. Curamericas Global works in Guatemala and Liberia and plans to start a project in Sierra Leone in 2015. All Curamericas Global's programs focus on teaching prevention and also help to establish health clinics in areas of desperate need.
