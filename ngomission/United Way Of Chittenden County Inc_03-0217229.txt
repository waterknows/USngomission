United Way of Chittenden County (UWCC) works to build a stronger Chittenden County by mobilizing our community to improve people's lives. We do this work by valuing relationships as the keys to our success, committing to authentic diversity and inclusion, and by pursuing real social change through collective community strategies. We move beyond philanthropy and create real change by: raising community resources (money & volunteer time); leading community initiatives on a range of issues related to Education, Income and Health; and investing in the local Chittenden County community by funding non-profits and mobilizing volunteers for a range of programs.
