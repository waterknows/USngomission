Catholic Charities of Northern Nevada is dedicated to easing the pain of poverty and changing lives for good. We help people of all cultures and beliefs rise up out of poverty and overcome the barriers to self-sufficiency. We do this through a broad range of services, including helping people with food resources, affordable housing, clothing, and other basic needs. In 2012, we provided more than 435,000 basic human needs services to people throughout Northern Nevada.
