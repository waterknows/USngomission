Founded in 1994, the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) is a member-supported organization, dedicated to protecting coral reefs by integrating ecosystem management, sustainable tourism, and community partnerships. CORAL works with communities to identify and solve conservation challenges; changes attitudes and behavior through education and training; provides resources to strengthen conservation efforts; and creates incentives for sustainable tourism. Like rain forests, coral reefs are invaluable resources for scientific research, with the potential to provide raw materials for lifesaving medical treatments. Reefs and their associated mangrove and sea grass ecosystems buffer coastlines from the destruction of devastating storms, and they provide rich economic opportunities through tourism and fishing.
