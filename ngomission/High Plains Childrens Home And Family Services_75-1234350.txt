High Plains Children's Home and Family Services is fundamentally committed to the physical, emotional and spiritual health of society's youth who are orphaned, outcast, homeless, neglected, abused or otherwise taken advantage of. Residential group care consists of five family cottages serving children ages 2 through 17. The program includes independent living for high school students in care and after care for alumni of the organization who are attending college or otherwise need help. Approximately 56 children were served in 2011. The Home also provides affordable housing for adults with special needs.
