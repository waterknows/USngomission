The Paul Anderson Youth Home (PAYH) is a residential home providing Christian rehabilitation for young men seeking an alternative to incarceration. Continuing the mission set by Paul Anderson and his wife Glenda in 1961, the PAYH seeks to teach our young men that they are created by God and have a special purpose in life. We believe that young men with self-confidence and Christian character will become givers rather than takers, assets rather than liabilities. PAYH also provides help for parents of troubled teenagers, through resources, counseling, and referrals. Our unique program is designed to develop each young man spiritually, mentally, physically, emotionally, and socially. The daily curriculum combines biblical teaching and academic training in our accredited high school.
