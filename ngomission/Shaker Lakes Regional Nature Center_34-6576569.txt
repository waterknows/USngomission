The Nature Center at Shaker Lakes was founded in 1966 as the result of a grassroots community effort to preserve the Shaker Parklands from becoming the route for a new freeway connecting Cleveland's East Side to downtown. Our mission is to conserve a natural area, connect people with nature and inspire environmental stewardship. Ten thousand children participate annually in more than 30,000 hours of curriculum-related school programs, including a strong early childhood program for several East Side school districts and the Cleveland Public Schools. Additionally, 10,000 walkers, runners, and bird-watchers use the trails and grounds for exercise and enjoyment of nature.
