Of that, 22 acres have been developed into animal exhibits or facilities. Currently there are 104 different animal species and 1,484 animal specimens cared for at the Blank Park Zoo. The Blank Park Zoo's Conservation Committee works to raise funds to support organizations and projects around the world dedicated to the same conservation ideals.
