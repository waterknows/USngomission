The Boy Scouts of America, Twin Rivers Council provides youth with an opportunity to try new things, provide service to others, build self-confidence, and reinforce ethical standards. These opportunities not only help them when they are young, but carry forward into their adult lives. The skills they learn in Scouting help them overcome obstacles and challenges with courage and character throughout their lives.
