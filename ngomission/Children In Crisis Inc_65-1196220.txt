In 2003, Children in Crisis was established to raise and manage the funds to build, staff, and operate The Children's Neighborhood, a residential style foster care neighborhood. The Children's Neighborhood provides an emergency shelter for young children, group foster homes help with the severe shortage of foster homes in our community, and studio apartments for teens that have aged out of the foster care system. From a small grass-roots group of individuals the organization has grown to over 200 members, including CPAs, architects, attorneys, educators, builders, employees of DCF, and volunteers from the Guardian Ad Litem program. Since 2007, we have provided a loving home and support for over 500 children.
