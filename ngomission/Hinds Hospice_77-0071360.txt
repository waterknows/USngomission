Founded in 1981, Hinds Hospice upholds the dignity and eases the suffering of the terminally ill while supporting their loved ones, and those who are grieving. The philosophy of Hinds Hospice is based on our sacred call to serve the physical, emotional and spiritual needs of those who have a life-limiting illness and those who are grieving. Through our services, we strive to provide comfort, hope and companionship on their sacred journey by affirming their dignity and honoring the wishes of both the patient and the family. We respond to the critical need for education on end-of-life issues and seek to raise the community's awareness of choices for care, support and bereavement.
