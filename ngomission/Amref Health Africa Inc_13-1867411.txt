Amref Health Africa is the largest African-based nonprofit that delivers health services to over 30 countries on the continent. Our vision is lasting health change in Africa. Originally founded in 1957 as the Flying Doctors of East Africa and staffed by doctors who flew light aircraft to bring emergency health care to remote areas, our work is now focused on training health workers at all levels and strengthening community health systems. We use African solutions to tackle critical African health challenges with African expertise. Over 90% of our staff working on the ground is African.
