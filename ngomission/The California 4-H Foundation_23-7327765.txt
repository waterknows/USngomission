Founded in 1971, The California 4-H Foundation supports the mission and direction of the California 4-H Youth Development Program by identifying and securing resources that advance the program's core values and criteria. We build partnerships with foundations, corporations and individuals whose funding interests are met through investments in statewide 4-H youth development programs. The University of California 4-H Youth Development Program engages youth in reaching their fullest potential while advancing the field of youth development.
