Our mission at the Boys & Girls Clubs of the Western Reserve is to inspire and enable all young people to realize their full potential as productive, responsible and caring citizens. The Boys & Girls Clubs have three Priority Outcome Areas: Academic Success, Good Character & Citizenship and Healthy Lifestyles. The Boys & Girls Clubs of the Western Reserve has a unique place in the history of the Boys & Girls Clubs movement. Our local organization began in 1984 as the “Boys & Girls Club of Summit County” and was one of three selected urban sites participating in a national demonstration project to test the feasibility of bringing Club programs into low-income housing areas designed by Boys Clubs of America and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. We are committed to changing kids' lives by providing them with a safe place to belong after school where dedicated staff members and caring volunteers are ready with a smile and an encouraging hand to help a young person in need.
