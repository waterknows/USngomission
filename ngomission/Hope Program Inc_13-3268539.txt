The HOPE Program empowers New Yorkers living in poverty to achieve economic self-sufficiency through employment and advancement. In our nearly three decades of service, we have achieved results among the strongest in the industry, including a 70% job placement rate, and 90-day and one-year retention rates of 90% and 70% respectively. With unemployment rates of 10% across Brooklyn, up to 40% for formerly incarcerated, 14% for those who lack a HS diploma or GED, and 16% for African Americans, HOPE's work has never been more important than it is today.
