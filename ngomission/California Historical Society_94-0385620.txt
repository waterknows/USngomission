California's Historical Society's mission is to inspire and empower people to make California's richly diverse past a meaningful part of their contemporary lives. CHS stimulates public exploration of the past through exhibitions and public programs statewide, fosters scholarship through research collections and publications, and promotes history education in California. CHS shares its collections through an exhibition gallery in the heart of the Yerba Buena district.
