Founded in 1909, Mental Health America (formerly known as the National Mental Health Association) is the country's leading nonprofit dedicated to helping all people live mentally healthier lives. Through nearly a century of advocacy at the national, state and local levels, Mental Health America has sought to protect the rights of individuals with mental illnesses; to undo decades of neglect and substandard care; to seek access to equitable, accessible and culturally competent services; and to seek new funding and reinvestment in both infrastructure and services in the community. With our more than 320 affiliates nationwide, we represent a growing movement of Americans who promote mental wellness for the health and well-being of the nation everyday and in times of crisis.
