Founded in 1948, Morris Animal Foundation (MAF) improves the health and well-being of companion animals and wildlife by funding humane health studies and disseminating information about those studies. MAF has been at the forefront of funding health breakthroughs that have helped animals on all seven continents. Our funded research helps a wide variety of animals, including companion animals such as dogs, cats, horses, llamas/alpacas, as well as wildlife including mountain gorillas, elephants, rhinoceros, wolves, sea otters, and many varieties of birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish. More than 50 of the world's most respected research institutions, colleges of veterinary medicine, and zoos are conducting nearly 200 MAF-sponsored studies and veterinary student projects.
