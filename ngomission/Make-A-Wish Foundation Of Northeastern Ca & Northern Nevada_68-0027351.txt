Make-A-Wish Foundation of Northeastern California and Northern Nevada's mission is to grant wishes to children with life-threatening medical conditions to enrich the human experience with hope, strength and joy. Make-A-Wish Foundation of Northeastern California and Northern Nevada was founded in 1983. Since that time, the chapter has granted more than 3,800 wishes. The Foundation makes a tangible difference in the life of a child and a family by fulfilling one special, heartfelt wish for the child and involving the entire family. The once-in-a-lifetime wish experience strengthens the child's resilience and will to fight the illness, and brings the family together once again in the midst of hospitalizations and treatment schedules, pain, confusion and fear accompanying a life-threatening medical condition. The organization works with hundreds of volunteers who help discover and grant the one true wish of the child. These volunteers' lives are transformed by the wish-granting experience.
