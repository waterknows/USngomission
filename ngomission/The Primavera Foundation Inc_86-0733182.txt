The Primavera Foundation provides pathways out of poverty through safe, affordable housing, workforce development and neighborhood revitalization. The Primavera Foundation began in the early 1980's as a response to the growing numbers of homeless individuals on the streets of Tucson. Primavera has expanded its services and advocacy work over the past 27 years to include: workforce development programs that help people return to work; develop job skills and provide special assistance to former prisoners; rental housing that provides stable, long-term and affordable solutions to the community's lack of affordable, safe housing; Financial Education, Home Ownership and Mortgage Foreclosure Prevention workshops that help families work towards financial security; Neighborhood Revitalization programs that help neighborhoods become communities of choice; and proactive Community Engagement that provides communities with sustainable solutions to issues.
