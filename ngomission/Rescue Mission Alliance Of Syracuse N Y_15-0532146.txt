Founded in 1887, the Rescue Mission works to share hope, end hunger and homelessness and change lives by strengthening communities one person at a time. We provide hot nutritious meals for the hungry. For the homeless, we offer safe beds in our emergency shelter, clean clothes from our giveaway program and hot showers. Being there from the very beginning gives us the privilege to speak to the issues that made them homeless and suggest how they can get started when they are ready to take the next step.
