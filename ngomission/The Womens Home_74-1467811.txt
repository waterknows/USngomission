Since 1957, The Women's Home has helped women in the greater Houston area build whole lives. Our services focus on meeting the needs of women who have histories of addiction, mental illness, homelessness, past abuse and a lack of job skills or education. These issues often form a tragic cycle that strip a woman of her dignity and ability to realize her full potential.We offer our residents a home and an individualized WholeLifeÂ® program based on six wellness areas: emotional, financial, physical, social, spiritual and vocational. Our two unique residential campuses provide individually tailored services to our residents. Our treatment and transitional housing program has 50 beds and offers residents up to 18 months of support. In addition, The Women's Home owns and operates an 87-unit apartment community, called Jane Cizik Garden Place, which offers permanent supportive housing specializing in women centered services.
