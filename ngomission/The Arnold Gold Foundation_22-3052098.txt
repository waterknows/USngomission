The mission of The Arnold P. Gold Foundation is to optimize healthcare outcomes by promoting patient care that is as humane as it is technologically sophisticated. We works with physicians in training and in practice, as well as other members of the healthcare team, to infuse a culture of respect, dignity and compassion for patients and practitioners. Humanistic medical care is not simply compassion. It is the best of medicine. When skilled physicians build caring, trusting and collaborative relationships with patients, research reveals more appropriate medical decisions, better patient adherence with treatment plans, and less costly healthcare outcomes. The staggering ascendance of science and technology, along with current healthcare economics, makes our efforts to keep the care in healthcare even more critical today than when the Foundation began in 1988. The Gold Foundation creates and supports national programs and grant making activities for which schools, teaching hospitals and other appropriate institutions may apply. The Foundation also provides funding for innovative projects proposed by students, residents and faculty.
