Ronald McDonald House Charities of Chicagoland and Northwest Indiana (RMHC-CNI) provides a â€˜home away from home' for families of pediatric patients being cared for in our partner hospitals, while also pro-actively reaching out to children in need with mobile medical and educational opportunities. We execute this mission via: our four Ronald McDonald Houses. The Ronald McDonald Family Room, Ronald McDonald Care Mobile, and the RMHC-CNI scholarship program.
