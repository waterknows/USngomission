In 2005, Edie Widder, Ph.D. co-founded the Ocean Research & Conservation Association (ORCA) in Fort Pierce, Florida, with a focus on developing innovative technologies to protect and restore our aquatic ecosystems and the species they sustain. The mission of ORCA is to protect and restore aquatic ecosystems and the species they sustain through the development of innovative technologies and science-based conservation action. Since its inception, Dr. Widder and the ORCA team of engineers, research scientists and marine biologists have achieved exciting progress in using the latest technologies to develop low-cost solutions for analysis of our polluted waterways.
