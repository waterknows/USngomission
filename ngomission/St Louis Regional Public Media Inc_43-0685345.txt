On air since 1954, KETC provides trusted independent media and gives voice and vision to a democratic society. KETC engages and entertains the community with the diversity of ideas, issues, discourse and experiences that inform our present, guide our future and illuminate a wider world. We provide quality content because it strengthens civic life. We remain independent because we believe it is the basis of trust. We are committed to engagement because it fosters a healthy community. We believe in making our content easily accessible, because the more people we engage, the greater our value becomes. We work to bring St. Louis together as we connect our region to the world and the world to St. Louis.
