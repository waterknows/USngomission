Habitat for Humanity International was founded in 1976, Habitat Suffolk is an independently operated affiliate of HFHI. Habitat for Humanity International is an ecumenical Christian partnership of concerned people working together with people who live in substandard housing or who cannot find adequate affordable housing. Habitat for Humanity Suffolk is able to build houses for approximately $100,000 each. We issue a no-profit, no interest mortgage on each home. The homeowner pays approximately $800-950 a month (depending on the township) including mortgage, taxes and insurance. Each homeowner agrees to contribute 270 hours of building time (sweat equity) on his or her own home and other Habitat homes, to complete educational classes, and to perform community service as the down-payment on their new home.
