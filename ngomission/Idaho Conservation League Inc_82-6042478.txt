The Idaho Conservation League preserves Idaho's clean water, wilderness and quality of life through citizen action, public education, and professional advocacy. Since 1973, our members have worked for common-sense solutions for our communities and for Idaho's great outdoors. Today, we work with rural homeowners near toxic dairies to prevent water and air pollution; safeguard clean air from grass field burning; seek to end pollution caused by phosphate processing; protect the freedom and solitude found in natural places; and enhance wildlife and recreation opportunities by restoring and preserving Idaho rivers and forests.
