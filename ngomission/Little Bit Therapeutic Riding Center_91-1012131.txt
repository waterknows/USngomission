Founded in 1976, Little Bit Therapeutic Riding Center's mission is to improve the bodies, minds and spirits of children and adults with disabilities through equine-assisted therapies and activities and to be an inspiration and educational resource to the therapeutic riding profession, both regionally and nationally. Our equine-assisted activities and adaptive riding programs provide life-changing physical benefits such as strengthening muscles, preventing bone weakness and joint dislocation, improving balance and enhancing hand/eye coordination. These benefits improve a rider's overall health, which, in turn, can increase life expectancy.
