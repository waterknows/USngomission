In 1888, Union Gospel Mission of Tarrant County (UGM-TC) was established to coordinate the relief efforts of local churches to aid the poor and dispossessed. Since then, the mission has grown to a 6 acre campus, with programs for men, women, and families and a free primary care clinic. We are a local united Christian organization and ministry dedicated to providing love, hope, respect, and a new beginning to the homeless. Because lasting life change is not possible without a change of heart, we stress the importance of holistic care, including physical, emotional, educational and spiritual needs. We will serve over 217,000 meals and provide service to more than 75% of the homeless population of Tarrant County this year. Working in collaboration with many local agencies and organizations, we facilitate access to services and benefits available in the community to augment and compliment Mission programs.
