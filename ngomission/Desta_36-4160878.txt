Founded in 1997, International Development & Educational Associates (IDEAS) was incorporated with the intent to either begin or partner with projects focusing on holistic development around the world. Today, IDEAS' work is to meet tangible and holistic needs among communities of forgotten and overlooked people. They work in 13 countries and operate projects in five categories: agriculture, business, community development, education and healthcare. IDEAS Associates use their professional skills and experiences to see holistic transformation occur socially, intellectually, physically and spiritually. Associates develop relationships, assess the needs and assets of communities and design projects to specifically meet those needs tangibly.
