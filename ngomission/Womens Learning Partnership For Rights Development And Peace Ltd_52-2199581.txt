Women's Learning Partnership (WLP) is dedicated to women's leadership and empowerment. At its essence, WLP is a builder of networks, working with 20 autonomous and independent partner organizations in the Global South to empower women to transform their families, communities, and societies. WLP's work uses the programmatic strategies of (1) leadership and advocacy curriculum development in 20 languages, (2) training at the grassroots, national, and regional levels (3) strengthening civil society, and (4) women's human rights advocacy and movement building. Our primary objectives are to increase the number of women taking on leadership and decision-making roles at family, community, and national levels, and to improve the effectiveness of feminist movements in Muslim-majority societies and globally by strengthening the capacity of our partner organizations. We invite you to keep up to date on the results that you help make possible: WLP Blog www.learningpartnership.org/blog
