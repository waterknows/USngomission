The Louisiana Baptist Children's Home (LBCH) has been taking care of children and families in need since 1899. Through the support of friends around the world we are able to provide help and hope without cost to those who cannot afford care and without the support of government placement funds. LBCH provides residential childcare for children grades kindergarten through twelfth, foster family care for preschool children and children needing more individual care, professional Christian counseling through the Granberry Counseling Centers, maternity care for young unwed girls and adoption services through Sellers Maternity Ministries.
