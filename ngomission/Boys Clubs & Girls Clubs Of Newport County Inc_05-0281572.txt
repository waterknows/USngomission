The Boys & Girls Clubs of Newport County works to inspire and enable all young people, especially those who need help most, to realize their full potential as productive, responsible and caring citizens. For more than 50 years, we have provided quality programs to children and youth in our community. We provide critical services, including mentoring, academic programming, athletic activities and warm meals, to more than 1,700 members, aged 5-18, annually.
