AdoptaPlatoon Soldier Support EffortÂ® founded in 1998 is a volunteer based nonprofit 501C-3 dedicated to serving deployed United States Service Members ensuring that they are not forgotten by a grateful Nation. AdoptaPlatoon strives to provide a better deployment quality of life by sending cards, letters and care packages to lift the morale of Troops as they serve far from home and assist military families. AdoptaPlatoon provides an on-going mail support system, creates projects that meet the need of military requests, and establishes special projects that benefit deployed Troops representing all branches of the U.S. military. AdoptaPlatoon also serves wounded/ injured Troops through our "AAP Walking Wounded" campaign and assists military veterans who remain our Nation's Heroes. www.adoptaplatoon.org.
