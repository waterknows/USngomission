The Children's Diabetes Foundation at Denver was established by Mr. and Mrs. Marvin Davis in 1977 in Denver, Colorado as an organization dedicated solely to the support of research in childhood diabetes and to provide the best possible clinical and educational programs for children with this disease. The Foundation's mission is to raise funds to support programs at the Barbara Davis Center for Childhood Diabetes where more than 5,000 children and young adults from all over America currently receive care. In addition, recreational activities are provided for children with diabetes to help increase their ability with chronic illness and live normal lives despite the constraints of the disease.
