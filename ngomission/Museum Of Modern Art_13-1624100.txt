Founded in 1929 as an educational institution, The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) is dedicated to being the foremost museum of modern art in the world. Central to MoMA's mission is the encouragement of an ever deeper understanding and enjoyment of modern and contemporary art by the diverse local, national, and international audiences that it serves. MoMA manifests this commitment by establishing, preserving, and documenting a permanent collection that reflects the vitality, complexity, and unfolding patterns of modern and contemporary art; by presenting exhibitions and educational programs of significance; by sustaining a library, archives, and conservation laboratory as international centers of research; and by supporting scholarship and publications of intellectual merit.
