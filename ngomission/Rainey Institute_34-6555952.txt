Rainey Institute is dedicated to positive change for Greater Cleveland's youth and families through education and participation in the visual and performing arts. Children ages 3 and up attend Rainey after school, on Saturdays, and during the Summer to explore music, dance, drama, sewing and art. They develop their artistic abilities and their character. Rainey students learn to be leaders and positive role models. They are prepared to be “on stage” at all times, enabling them to succeed in school and life.
