Loudoun Interfaith Relief (LIR) feeds the hungry of Loudoun County. LIR formed in 1991 by a group of dedicated volunteers from the area who realized the hunger needs of the community were not being met. These volunteers were united by a commitment to offer support and solutions to several groups of people: (1) the working poor whose income is insufficient to cover basic necessities, (2) the unemployed, (3) the senior or the sick who cannot compete in the workplace, and (4) the homeless who have no income and cannot afford a roof over their head. This past year, LIR directly served approximately 17,000 individuals (over 2,400 families) through 94,000 visits. Last fiscal year, LIR was able to provide enough food to prepare almost 850,000 meals.
