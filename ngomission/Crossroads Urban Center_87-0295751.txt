Crossroads Urban Center helps to organize low income, disabled, and minority Utahns to be advocates on their own behalf in addressing essential issues affecting the quality of their lives. We also provide direct services to help meet basic survival needs. We are part of a tradition of service in the Salt Lake area that goes back 126 years. When Crossroads was formed in 1966, an emergency food pantry and thrift store quickly emerged as focal points for community involvement. Crossroads has initiated and developed dozens of new community organizations to provide services not otherwise available in our community.
