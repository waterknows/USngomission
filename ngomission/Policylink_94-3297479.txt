PolicyLink is a national research and action institute advancing economic and social equity. PolicyLink work is guided by the belief that those closest to the nation's challenges are central to the search for solutions. With local and national partners, PolicyLink is spotlighting promising practices, supporting advocacy campaigns, and helping to bridge the traditional divide between local communities and policymaking at the local, regional, state, and national levels. By developing and implementing multifaceted strategies, PolicyLink seeks to ensure that everyone- including low-income communities of color- can contribute to and benefit from local and regional growth and development.
