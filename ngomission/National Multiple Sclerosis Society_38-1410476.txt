The National Multiple Sclerosis Society, Michigan Chapter was organized in 1948 to end the devastating effect of multiple sclerosis (MS). We do this by supporting the national organization and its research into the cause and cure of multiple sclerosis; providing direct and indirect services to people afflicted with MS and their families; launching public awareness and public and professional education campaigns; and developing and promoting public policy to support people afflicted with MS and their families.
