The U.S. Sportsmen's Alliance Foundation protects and defends America's wildlife conservation programs and the pursuits -- hunting, fishing and trapping -- which generate the money to pay for them. The U.S. Sportsmen's Alliance Foundation is responsible for public education, legal defense and research. Its mission is accomplished through several distinct programs, coordinated to provide the most complete defense capability possible. Since 1978, the U.S. Sportsmen's Alliance and its Foundation have been working to defend hunting, fishing, trapping and scientific wildlife management against lawsuits, legislation and ballot issues initiated by anti-hunters.
