Founded in 1984, the mission of the Lower Cape Outreach Council is to provide emergency assistance of food clothing and financial support to individuals and families in Brewster, Chatham, Eastham, Harwich, Orleans, Provincetown, Truro and Wellfleet which will lead to healthy, productive and self-sustaining lives as part of the Cape Cod community. We also run Katy's Korner, a free clothing store in Orleans, where qualified clients from each of these 8 towns may come and receive quality clothing and bedding.
