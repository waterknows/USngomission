The OUR Center (Outreach United Resource Center) helps people move toward self-sufficiency by unifying community resources. The organization provides emergency services to help people through short-term financial crises and also works in partnership with our clients to develop case plans for those needing longer-term assistance. The OUR Center offers programs ranging from emergency assistance with rent, utilities, food, clothing, shelter, and transportation, to longer term programs that help many of our clients solve underlying problems such as financial difficulties and unemployment. These longer term programs are handled by trained case workers, who help each client discover his or her own personal resources, strengths, and skills. Clients are taught useful life skills, problem solving, budgeting and planning. OUR Center case workers also coordinate with and connect clients with other community resources needed to create financial stability for themselves and their families.
