Founded in 1984, Northwest Folklife creates opportunities for all to celebrate, share, and participate in the evolving cultural traditions of the Pacific Northwest. We present the Northwest Folklife Festival in Seattle Center on Memorial Day Weekend. The Pacific Northwest is home to an extraordinary group of communities - ethnic, familial, occupational, religious, and regional - and we believe it is important to celebrate and help sustain the traditions of all of those groups. Doing so revitalizes people and communities and helps preserve cultural heritage for years to come.
