Kidsave is working to move older children out of orphanages and foster care and into permanent, loving families. Kidsave gives older kids in US foster care and foreign orphanages the opportunity to visit with families and build relationships. We work as a catalyst for change, training social workers, orphanage workers and volunteers to help kids find permanent families, and change practices, laws and public financing to increase permanent family care for orphans and youth in foster care. Since 1999, more than 3,000 children have found parents and lasting connections with adults because of our programs. Thousands more orphans and children in foster care around the globe have parents and lasting connections because of our training and advocacy efforts.
