Hope Center for Kids strives to faithfully inspire hope in North Omaha youth and children through education, employability, collaboration and faith. From the first day a child enters our program they are bombarded with hope. Hope that they will be strong enough to combat peer pressure. Hope that they will one day graduate from high school and attend college. Hope that their life has extraordinary meaning. We see strong, intelligent young men and women in North Omaha. Our goal is to allow them to see this as well. By inspiring hope into their lives, we have seen just how capable they are.
