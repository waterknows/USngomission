The Sierra Club Foundation bridges the intersection of strategic philanthropy and grassroots advocacy. As a publicly supported charity, we partner with thousands of donors across the U.S. to invest in organizations that have an outsized impact on the health of the planet. To support our vision for a powerful, inclusive environmental movement focused on climate solutions, conservation, and movement building, we give special consideration to charitable programs that reinforce and advance these imperatives.
