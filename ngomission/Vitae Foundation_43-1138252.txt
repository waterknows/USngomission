Established in 1992, the Vitae Foundation is focused on educating about the value and sanctity of human life and restoring this value as a core belief in the American culture. The key focus of the Vitae strategy is to use mass media, namely television, radio, print and online media, as the venues for sharing educational messages. These mass media messages are intended to: encourage internal reflection and value formation when strategically placed during the T.V. and online programming viewed/searched by a target audience, and to assist women, troubled by an untimely pregnancy, find loving assistance in their community. Vitae believes in the power of the research based message. Educational messages that are respectful, helpful, and encourage dialogue in a non-threatening manner, have become the hallmark of the Vitae success.
