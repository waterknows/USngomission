The mission of Misericordia is to support individuals with developmental disabilities in maximizing their level of independence and self-determination within an environment that fosters spirituality, dignity, respect and enhancement of quality of life. We promote development of natural family and community support, community awareness, education and advocacy. Misericordia has been providing services for persons in need since 1921. Today, Misericordia is proud to support 550 children and adults with mild to profound developmental disabilities. Misericordia has a wide range of programs, including: residential placement and day-to-day support; job training and employment opportunities; physical, occupational and speech therapy; fitness and healthy living guidance; social and recreational outings; and opportunities for spiritual growth.
