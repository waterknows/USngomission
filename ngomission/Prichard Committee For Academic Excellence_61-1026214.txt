The Prichard Committee For Academic Excellence aims to provide a public voice for continually improved education for all Kentuckians. It recognizes that if the Kentucky economy is to continue growing and expanding, educational improvements must too. To help meet that need, the Prichard Committee marked its 25th anniversary by embarking on an ambitious Top 20 By 2020 Campaign designed to put Kentucky in the highest tier of public education in the nation.
