The Jewish Tuition Organization (JTO) was established in 1999 with the goal of ensuring no child is denied a Jewish day school education because of the cost. Since then, JTO has been privileged to make a difference in the lives of students in the Phoenix area by awarding over 4,000 need-based scholarships to students at seven partner schools. As a student tuition organization (STO), the JTO is able to raise funds for these scholarships through the dollar-for-dollar Arizona Private School Tax Credit. Thanks to the generous support of partners like you, JTO distributes an average of 400 scholarships per year worth over a combined $2 million.
