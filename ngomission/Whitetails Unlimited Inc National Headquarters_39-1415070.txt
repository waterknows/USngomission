Founded in 1982, Whitetails Unlimited (WTU) is a national conservation organization that has remained true to its mission and has made great strides in the field of conservation. We have gained the reputation of being the nation's premier organization dedicating our resources to the betterment of the white-tailed deer and its environment. Our purpose is to raise funds in support of educational programs; habitat conservation; and preservation of the hunting tradition for the direct benefit of the white-tailed deer and other wildlife. Since our beginning, we have spent over 49.7 million dollars on WTU projects including research, wildlife agency assistance, habitat enhancement/acquisition, public education, hunter safety/education, and cooperative projects with conservation organizations.
