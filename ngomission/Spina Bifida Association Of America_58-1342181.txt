The Spina Bifida Association (SBA) serves adults and children who live with the challenges of spina bifida. Spina bifida is a neural tube defect that happens in the first month of pregnancy when the spinal column doesn't close completely. Since 1973, SBA has been the only national voluntary health agency solely dedicated to enhancing the lives of those with Spina Bifida and those whose lives are touched by this challenging birth defect. Its tools are education, advocacy, research, and service. Through its network of chapters, SBA has a presence in more than 125 communities nationwide and touches thousands of people each year. Lives are changed by the programs SBA has created, the services the organization provides, and the accomplishments of its advocacy efforts.
