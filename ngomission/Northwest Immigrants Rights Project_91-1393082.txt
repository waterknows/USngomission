Northwest Immigrant Rights Project (NIRP) promotes justice by defending and advancing the rights of immigrants through direct legal services, systemic advocacy, and community education. Each year, NWIRP provides direct legal assistance in immigration matters to over 10,000 low-income people from over 150 countries, speaking over 60 different languages and dialects. NWIRP also strives to achieve systemic change to policies and practices affecting immigrants through impact litigation, public policy work, and community education. NWIRP serves the community from four offices in Washington State in Seattle, Granger, Tacoma, and Wenatchee.
