Since 1982, Foodshare has sought to end hunger in our region. Foodshare is the heart of greater Hartford's fight against hunger. We bring together individuals and organizations to create effective solutions to end hunger in all 42 towns of Hartford and Tolland counties. Foodshare distributes more than 16 tons of food each day to a network of 300 local partners that feed our hungry neighbors. This vital safety net helps 128,000 people in our region who are at risk including more than 10,000 seniors, the working poor, and 50,000 children get some of the food they need for today.
