The Women's Sports Foundation is an educational organization founded in 1974 by tennis legend Billie Jean King. Our mission is to advance the lives of girls and women through sports and physical activity. One of the top five public grant-giving women's funds in the United States, the Foundation distributes $10,000-20,000 per week from operating dollars to provide opportunities for socioeconomically underprivileged and inactive girls to participate in sports and physical activity. The Foundation works for equal opportunity for our daughters to play sports so they, too, can derive the psychological, physiological and sociological benefits of sports participation.
