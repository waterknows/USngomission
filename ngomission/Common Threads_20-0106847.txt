The mission of Common Threads is to educate children on nutrition and well-being. Our vision is to prevent childhood obesity, and our proven programs empower children to cook and eat healthy. Common Threads delivers culturally-relevant cooking and nutrition curriculum and programs for kids in underserved schools and communities that that result in life-long healthy eating habits.
