The Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) Foundation seeks to provide unique and urgently needed services that improve the lives of veterans, military personnel and their families all the while supporting positive citizen involvement for the betterment of U.S. communities. Our varied programs include long-distance communication options for our troops in Iraq, Afghanistan and military hospitals through distribution of telephone cards (almost 10,000,000 so far) and Cyber Caf√© calling days; financial grants for military families in need to help pay for rent, mortgage, utilities, medical treatment and food; assistance for veterans in the filing of entitlement claims with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs; and patriotic student essay contests that award money for college to America's youth; etc. All of our programs are non-political, free and require no VFW-affiliation for assistance.
