The Huntington's Disease Society of America (HDSA) is a national, voluntary health organization dedicated to improving the lives of people with Huntington's Disease and their families. Founded in 1967, HDSA promotes and supports research and medical efforts to eradicate Huntington's Disease; assists people and families affected by Huntington's Disease to cope with the problems presented by the disease; and educates the public and health professionals about Huntington's Disease. Huntington's Disease (HD) is a devastating, hereditary, degenerative brain disorder for which there is, at present, no effective treatment or cure. HD slowly diminishes the affected individual's ability to walk, think, talk and reason.
