Safari Club International Foundation (SCI Foundation) is "First for Wildlife." The mission is to fund and direct worldwide programs dedicated to wildlife conservation and outdoor education. SCI Foundation works closely with Safari Club International, its chapters, and members to advance local, regional and global wildlife conservation, outdoor education, and humanitarian projects each year. The group also supports scientific studies in the field of predator-prey relationships and wildlife habitat restoration and management. SCI Foundation demonstrates the constructive role that sustainable-use hunting and hunters play in the conservation of wildlife; carries out and supports outdoor educational programs; supports humanitarian programs to assist the disabled and those in need to enjoy hunting; and provides donations to other organizations pursuing similar goals.
