CurePSP is dedicated to increasing awareness of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and related brain diseases; advancing research toward cure and prevention; educating healthcare professionals; and providing support, education and hope for affected persons and their families. 



PSP and CBD are neurodegenerative brain diseases that have no known cause, treatment or cure. They affect nerve cells that control walking, balance, mobility, vision, speech, and swallowing. Five to six people per 100,000 will develop PSP. CBD affects an estimated 2000-3000 people in United States, of whom only 500-750 are diagnosed.
