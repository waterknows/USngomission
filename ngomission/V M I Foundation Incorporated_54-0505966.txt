The VMI Foundation's mission is simple: to raise, steward, and invest the funds entrusted to it by members of the VMI Family for the sole purpose of advancing Virginia Military Institute. The VMI Foundation supports the constant improvement of the Institute's academic and co-curricular programs. It also supports capital improvements on Post that ensure that VMI has the high-quality facilities necessary to provide a modern education and a healthful environment in which the Corps of Cadets live, learn, and compete. Also, immediate gifts from donors and endowments that the VMI Foundation manages annually generate millions of dollars in financial aid.
