Tara Hall was founded in 1969. Tara Hall, which accepts neglected, troubled and abused boys, is an effective Christ centered long-term residential school that develops moral, social, educational and life skills, thus building responsible contributing adults, while providing services to their families. Founded in 1969, Tara Hall is more than just a residential home for boys; Tara Hall is a refuge. It is a place of restoration and recovery and a home of hope for young men who have come tragically close to losing all hope.
