ChildBuilders is a non-profit organization that has been strengthening Houston since 1974. We train individuals to deliver our solutions to children and youth of greater Houston that promote healthy decision-making skills proven to prevent risky behaviors and abuse. We influence their awareness, beliefs and attitudes with measurable results. Our programs teach children, teachers and parents important skills to help children lead healthier emotional and social lives.
