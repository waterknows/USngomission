Founded in 1997, Soaring Eagle's primary goal is to provide financial support to the Heritage Living Center, an assisted living facility for the Northern Cheyenne elders. The Heritage Living Center was created to ensure that Northern Cheyenne elders would not be moved hundreds of miles from the reservation to die alone in nursing homes far away from family and friends.
