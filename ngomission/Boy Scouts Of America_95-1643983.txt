The Boy Scouts of America, San Diego-Imperial Council was incorporated in 1930 for the primary purpose of coordinating and assisting Boy Scout activities in San Diego. The Desert Trails Council of Imperial County was merged with the San Diego Council in 1993. Our youth participate in exciting indoor/outdoor activities for boys ages 7-14 and for young men and women ages 14-20. Under the guidance of trained, adult volunteers, the youth develop life skills they need to become future leaders and active citizens in their communities. The Council provides service to two counties and 146 communities.
