New Yorkers For Children (NYFC) works in partnership with the Administration for Children's Services (ACS) to improve the prospects of children supported by the child welfare system and to engage New Yorkers in that effort. With a focus on young people in foster care, NYFC supports programs that promote paths to stable adulthood through education and sustainable relationships with caring adults.
