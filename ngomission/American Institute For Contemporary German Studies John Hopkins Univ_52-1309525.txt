The American Institute for Contemporary German Studies (AICGS) strengthens the German-American relationship in an evolving Europe and changing world. The Institute produces objective and original analyses of developments and trends in Germany, Europe and the United States; creates new transatlantic networks; and facilitates dialogue among the business, political, and academic communities to manage differences and define and promote common interests. Affiliated with The Johns Hopkins University, AICGS provides a comprehensive program of public forums, policy studies, research and study groups designed to enrich the political, corporate and scholarly constituencies it serves.
