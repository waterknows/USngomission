Founded in 1973, the Lighthouse of Broward (LHOB) serves visually impaired children, youth, working age adults and elders and is the primary resource for services and information for the blind in Broward County. As the only source in Broward County for comprehensive rehabilitation training and adaptive computer training for adults with visual impairment, LHOB also is the only local facility offering specialized skill building for blind babies and children. Every day, the staff at the Lighthouse strives to further its mission to enhance the independence, productivity and quality of life of children and adults who are blind or visually impaired.
