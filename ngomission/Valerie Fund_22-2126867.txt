The Valerie Fund was established in 1976 in memory of nine-year-old Valerie Goldstein by her parents, Ed and Sue. The Valerie Fund's mission is to provide support for the comprehensive health care of children with cancer and blood disorders. Today there are seven Valerie Fund Children's Centers for Cancer and Blood Disorders located in major hospitals in the tri-state area, providing caring and comprehensive health care to more than 5,000 children and their families each year. We bring state-of-the-art treatment centers close to the home, provide counseling and child development activities, make a summer camp experience that creates a one week miracle for children with cancer, and do thousands of other things large and small that collectively make a difference.
