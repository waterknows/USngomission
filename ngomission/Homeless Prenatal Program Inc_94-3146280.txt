Homeless Prenatal Program (HPP) joins with families to help them recognize their strengths and trust in their capacity to transform their lives to break the cycle of homelessness and poverty by seizing the motivating opportunity created by pregnancy and parenthood. HPP works with individuals but also addresses the larger issues in society to create change; HPP is committed to fight against racism, poverty, sexism and homophobia and all forms of oppression. Some of our services include: housing assistance; prenatal and parenting education program that teaches women about pregnancy and birth and how to raise a healthy child; on-the-job paid internship; community technology center; ESL classes; mental health services for parents and children; substance abuse services; family violence prevention services; and immigration support services.
