Founded in 1913, Crossnore School is a private children's home and school in the western North Carolina mountains, serving children who, for circumstances beyond their control, can no longer live at home, whether permanently or temporarily. Most residents live at Crossnore because their primary care givers are abusive or have neglected them to the point that their well being is threatened. Residents come from all counties in North Carolina. Our mission is to provide hope and healing in a homelike, residential education setting for children from families in crisis and our vision is to break the cycle of abuse, abandonment, and neglect for children from families in crisis.
