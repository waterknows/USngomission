Providence House is a residential development center for homeless families with children, providing comprehensive support services for improving the family structure and moving the family into independent living to break the homeless cycle. The singular aim of the program is to break the cycle of homelessness by helping families gain the resources necessary to move permanently into independent living. The Providence House program has a beginning and an ending. It is structured, yet flexible. In our holistic approach we evaluate all areas of each family's life and develop a plan with the family that will move them to their highest level of self sufficiency.
