Founded in 1981, Wellspring House empowers individuals and families to live more secure lives through basic needs assistance, education and job training. Our basic needs assistance program provides emergency shelter for families, housing search assistance for families living in motels, emergency homeless prevention funding and guidance, assistance for recently homeless families, permanent homes for 11 low-income people at our lodging house, and advocacy for affordable housing and issues related to homelessness. Wellspring House also offers education and job training opportunities through curriculums that are designed to make sure that adult students can access information in different learning styles, and respectful of the adult learner.
