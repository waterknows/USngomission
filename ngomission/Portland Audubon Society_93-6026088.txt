Founded in 1902, the Audubon Society of Portland promotes the understanding, enjoyment, and protection of native birds, other wildlife and their habitats. We connect people to nature and their power to protect it. Mobilizing Oregonians for over 100 years, we have been instrumental in developing the environmental policies that shape our region today. We offer natural history educational programs designed to engage children and adults alike in the appreciation and stewardship of nature, and conservation programs that provide engagement opportunities in natural resources stewardship and protection. With 12,000+ members residing throughout the state, we are the largest of the 457 chapters of National Audubon. Our 150 acre sanctuaries and Wildlife Care Center serve the Metropolitan Portland/Vancouver region, free of charge, hosting 40,000 visitors yearly. As the area's only wildlife rehabilitation center, we treat 3,000 animals and respond to 15,000 wildlife related inquiries each year.
