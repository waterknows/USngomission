The Tobin Project is a catalyst for transformative research in the social sciences. The mission of the Tobin Project is to mobilize, motivate, and support a community of scholars across the social sciences and allied fields seeking to deepen our understanding of significant challenges facing the nation over the long term. Toward this end, the Tobin Project aims to identify and pursue questions that, if addressed with rigorous scholarly research, could have the greatest potential to benefit society and to unlock doors within the academy to new and vital lines of inquiry. Though universities play a vital role in facilitating rigorous academic research, growing evidence suggests that external catalysts are needed to drive interdisciplinary research on the most pressing real-world problems. The Tobin Project is pioneering exactly this role.
