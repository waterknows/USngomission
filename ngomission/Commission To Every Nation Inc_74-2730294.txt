Commission To Every Nation is a non-denominational missionary sending agency helping "Ordinary People Partner with God to Accomplish the Extraordinary". Our goal is to advance the Gospel to every nation. More than 555 missionaries serve in over 58 countries to improve the spiritual, educational, and physical, conditions of people worldwide. These missionaries come from many nations, not just North America. We continue to see medical clinics, theological schools, linguistics efforts, homes for abused girls, orphanages, pastoral training, audio programs for indigenous and many more ministries make a difference in people's lives. Each missionary is able to fulfill their individual mission calling as we come along side with pastoral care and providing the home support.
