We have saved the lives of millions of babies since our founding and we won't stop until we reach the day when every baby is born healthy. Our mission is to help moms have full-term pregnancies and research the problems that threaten the health of babies. We carry out this mission through research, community services, education and advocacy to save babies' lives. Our researchers, volunteers, educators, outreach workers and advocates work together to give all babies a fighting chance against the threats to their health from premature birth, birth defects, and low birthweight.
