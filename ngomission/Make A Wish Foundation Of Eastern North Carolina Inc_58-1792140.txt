The Make-A-Wish Foundation of Eastern North Carolina has one purpose- to grant wishes to children between the ages of 2 1/2 and 18 with life-threatening medical conditions. The benefits of wish fulfillment are many and varied. Though it is difficult to measure the effect a wish has on a child, we believe that while doctors provide the medicine, the Make-A-Wish Foundation provides the magic. Since 1986, the chapter has granted more than 2,134 (and counting) favorite wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions throughout Eastern North Carolina.
