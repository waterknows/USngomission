The Battery Conservancy was created in 1994 to rebuild and revitalize the Battery and Castle Clinton National Monument, the park's major landmark. The Battery remains one of the oldest public open spaces in continuous use in New York City. The Conservancy honors and preserves this heritage by rebuilding the park's landscape to interpret its past. The new landscape also celebrates the natural environment while meeting the needs of a growing residential population, crowds of bustling commuters and workers, and the millions of visitors who come from all over the world to see the Statue of Liberty, the magic of this harbor and its many cultural destinations.
