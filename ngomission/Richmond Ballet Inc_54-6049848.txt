For three decades, Richmond Ballet has been guided by a mission that is both simple and grand in scope: to awaken and uplift the human spirit through dance. To achieve this, the State Ballet of Virginia presents professional ballet performances that meet the highest standards of excellence; trains ballet dancers, both student and professional; and excites and nurtures a love of dance with engaging education and outreach programs.
