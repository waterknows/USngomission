The ALS Association's mission is to lead the fight to cure and treat ALS through global, cutting-edge research and to empower people with Lou Gehrig's disease and their families to live fuller lives by providing them with compassionate care and support. As one of The ALS Association's leading chapters, the Greater New York Chapter plays a major role in promoting the mission of The ALS Association by: providing quality services to patients and families; funding aggressive, cutting-edge research to find a cure; supporting The ALS Association's national advocacy program and heightening awareness of ALS.
