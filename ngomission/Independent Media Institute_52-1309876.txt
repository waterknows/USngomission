The Independent Media Institute (IMI) empowers people with independent journalism, information, and media tools. IMI is dedicated to strengthening and supporting independent journalism, and to improving the public's access to independent information sources. In 1998, IMI created AlterNet, an award-winning news magazine and online community that creates original journalism and amplifies the best of dozens of other independent media sources. AlterNet's aim is to inspire action and advocacy on the environment, human rights and civil liberties, social justice, media, and health care issues. In addition, IMI hosts WireTap, an online independent information source by and for socially conscious youth. WireTap is a place for a new generation of writers, artists and activists to network and organize.
