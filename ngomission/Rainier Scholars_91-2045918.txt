Rainier Scholars is a community of energetic people who are passionate about the power of education and the immeasurable value of opportunity. Our scholars come from those groups most underrepresented on college campuses-including African Americans, Hispanic Latinos, Native Americans and first generation Asian Americans. We particularly recruit those students who have the greatest number of barriers to a college education. More than 80 percent of our scholars qualify as low-income. More than 85 percent come from households where they will be the first in their family to earn a college degree. Our scholars are distinguished as much by what they have as by what they don't have. All Rainier Scholars demonstrate innate cognitive ability, motivation and a strong work ethic. They share a desire to use education as a pathway to new possibilities.
