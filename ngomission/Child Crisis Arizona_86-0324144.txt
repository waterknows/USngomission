Child Crisis Arizona exists to provide hope and support to children threatened with abuse, neglect or homelessness. Each child is assured of nurturance and protection from experiences and environments that are harmful to their well-being. Families receive support through crisis intervention, counseling, parenting classes and referral to community resources. For 36 years, Crisis Nursery has been a safe haven, providing opportunities and hope to more than 19,000 children in Arizona - coming to the aid of over 120 children daily. On April 1, 2015 Crisis Nursery Inc. and Child Crisis Center merged into one organization.
