Public Broadcasting Atlanta (PBA), comprised of WABE 90.1 FM and PBA 30, brings NPR News, music, the arts and PBS programming to hundreds of thousands of listeners and viewers each year. As a broadcast service of Atlanta Public Schools in partnership with the Atlanta Educational Telecommunications Collaborative (AETC), PBA has never lost sight of its original mission. Education remains at the core of our operation at every level, from preschoolers to our elders. We serve community; we enhance life. We educate, entertain, empower. We broaden perspectives, create joy, expand knowledge. And through our endeavors, we connect people to each other and the world.
