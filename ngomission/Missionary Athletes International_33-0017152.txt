Founded in 1983, Missionary Athletes International (MAI) communicates the message of Jesus Christ through the environment of soccer. We accomplish this by doing sports ministry, training in sports ministry and deploying sports ministers as a resource to the Body of Christ. MAI was founded on the simple premise that, through the common enjoyment of this world-wide sport, we would be able to build relationships that allow us to share the Good News - a Beautiful Message of God's redeeming love for people of every nation. MAI has ministered in over 30 countries on six continents through the platform of soccer.
