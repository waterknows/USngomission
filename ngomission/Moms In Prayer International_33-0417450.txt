Moms in Prayer International impacts children and schools worldwide for Christ by gathering mothers to pray. We desire to be a supportive partner, building up the Body of Christ through prayer. We teach women how to pray corporately by using four biblical prayer principles, called the Four Steps of Prayer: Praise, silent Confession, Thanksgiving and Intercession. As women from the church become involved in a Moms in Prayer group, the result will be children being prayed for in the church. Praying for children and schools in the community has a powerful influence that reverberates throughout the city and state.
