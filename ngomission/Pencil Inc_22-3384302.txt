PENCIL, founded in 1995, has two core programs that enable business leaders to share their talent, ideas, and skills directly with schools and students in need. The PENCIL Partnership Program matches business volunteers with public school principals based on backgrounds, interests, and goals. Partners are then empowered and supported to develop solutions that transform their schools. The PENCIL Fellows Program provides promising public high school students with career readiness training that includes paid summer internships at leading businesses throughout the city. PENCIL pioneered the idea of improving student achievement by developing and supporting long-term partnerships between businesses and public schools.
