HERE builds a community that nurtures career artists as they create innovative hybrid live performance in theatre, dance, music, puppetry, media and visual art. Our artist residencies support the singular vision of the lead artist through commissions, long-term development, and production support. HERE's programs and performances promote relationships among local, national, and international artists. Our space is a destination for audiences who are passionate about ground-breaking contemporary work and the creative process behind it.
