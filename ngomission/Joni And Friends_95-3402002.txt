Founded by Joni Eareckson Tada in 1979, Joni and Friends communicates the gospel and equips Christ-honoring churches worldwide to evangelize and disciple people affected by disabilities. We present the clear and concise Gospel of Jesus Christ to all people with disabilities and their families served through our programs. We train, disciple, and mentor people affected by disability to exercise their gifts of leadership and service in the church and their communities. We energize the church to move from lack of awareness to including disabled persons into the fabric of worship, fellowship, and outreach.
