For over 30 years our community has generously contributed to the United Way for South Louisiana helping thousands of residents in Assumption, Lafourche, St. Mary, and Terrebonne parishes. The United Way for South Louisiana is dedicated to creating long-lasting change ensuring all residents have access to the building blocks to a better life: education, income and health. United Way is unique in its ability to bring together people active in their communities, business leaders, nonprofit organizations and government agencies to address the underlying causes of major South Louisiana problems.
