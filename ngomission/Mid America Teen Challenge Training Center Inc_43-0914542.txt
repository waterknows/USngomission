Teen Challenge International of Mid-America is a long term, residential, Christian program that ministers to men with drug, alcohol and other addictions. We are part of a worldwide network of ministries that include some 170 centers in the U.S. and approximately 150 throughout the world. We minister to the men academically through Bible and Bible-related classes and GED studies. We provide support for their emotional needs through pastoral counseling provided by our staff. They are given practical tools for life through our General Work Experience program. Spiritual needs are addressed through chapel and church services, prayer times and through the Turning Point small group ministry.
