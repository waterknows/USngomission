The Jewish Federation of Omaha is the Jewish community's central fundraising and planning address. The Federation sponsors a wide variety of social, educational, and cultural programs throughout the year, in addition to mounting an annual community-wide fundraising campaign. Campaign proceeds meet the physical and spiritual needs of Jews here in Omaha and around the world. Locally, the Federation umbrella includes ADL/CRC, the Jewish Community Center, Jewish Educational and Library Services, Jewish Family Service and Jewish Senior Services as well as Federation programs such as Jewish experience scholarships, missions to Israel, birthright Israel, our Partnership with Israel, Children's Needs Scholarships and Bar/Bat Mitzvah Camp Grants.
