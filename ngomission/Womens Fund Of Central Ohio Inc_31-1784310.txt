The Women's Fund of Central Ohio is a public foundation that transforms the lives of women and girls by mobilizing the collective power and passion of all women working together. We create gender equality and influence through our research and collaborations, promote social change by growing women's philanthropy, and make grants to programs that raise awareness and educate on issues affecting women and girls. At the Women's Fund we are amplifying the voices of all 800,000 women and girls throughout central Ohio, we serve Delaware, Fairfield, Franklin, Licking, Madison, Pickaway and Union counties.
