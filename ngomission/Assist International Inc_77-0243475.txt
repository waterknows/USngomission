Founded in 1990, Assist International is a humanitarian organization dedicated to relieving human suffering around the world by networking the resources in the world with the great human need that exists. We provide assistance and relief supplies such as food and medical equipment to the poor and needy in developing nations. We are also active in building family homes for orphaned and abandoned children, as well as establishing business enterprises to sustain the children's projects. Currently, we are involved in three major efforts: we address critical medical problems in major hospitals around the world, provide medical training seminars to hospital and medical staff, and provide relief and assistance to abandoned and orphaned children throughout the world.
