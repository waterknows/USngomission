Chicago Public Media is a community-supported, public service broadcasting institution. We offer programs that speak with many voices to community needs and are a reflection of the distinctive and diverse Chicago area. We help listeners learn about issues and ideas that affect the community, the nation, and the world. We produce, acquire, and distribute engaging, thoughtful, and entertaining programs of depth, breadth, diversity, and substance that speak powerfully. We are principally a broadcaster. We also serve our local and national community with supplemental distribution initiatives. We expand our outreach to the community and enhance our production effort through partnerships and educational programs with local and national institutions.
