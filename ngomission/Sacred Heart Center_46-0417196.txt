For almost three decades, the Sacred Heart Center has been helping to serve the needs of the people of the Cheyenne River Reservation region, an area the size of the state of Connecticut. The counties we serve are some of the poorest in the nation, yet some of the fastest growing in South Dakota. Eagle Butte, located near the center of the reservation, serves as tribal headquarters and is the largest community in the region. Founded by the Congregation of the Priests of the Sacred Heart, the Center remains true to the vision of the brotherhood and its founder, Father Leo John Dehon. Father Dehon was committed to service to the poor, meeting people's physical and spiritual needs through social services, and helping them to better lives. His commitment to care is still expressed in the Sacred Heart Center's passionate dedication to provide needed services to the people.
