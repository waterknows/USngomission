Since 1955, the National Kidney Foundation of Michigan has led the fight against kidney disease. We have enhanced the lives of many Michigan residents through our patient services, prevention programs, education programs, children's programs and research.Our efforts have also changed legislation, ensured quality care for patients and advanced medical knowledge. We have informed the public about kidney disease, diabetes, hypertension, and obesity and increased awareness of the critical need for organ and tissue donations. The Foundation has accomplished such success with the help and generosity of the community.
