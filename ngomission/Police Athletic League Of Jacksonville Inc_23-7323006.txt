Incorporated in 1972, Police Athletic League of Jacksonville (PAL) is one if the oldest citizen-building youth programs in the nation. It builds friendships between law enforcement officers and children within the community and is based on the conviction that young people - if reached early enough - can develop strong positive attitudes towards police officers in their journey through life toward the goal of maturity and good citizenship. PAL has embraced traditional American values where one generation responsibly shares its wisdom and helps kids learn to work together to be responsible for themselves, as well as set goals in their lives. Pal offers year-round and seasonal sports programs, after-school education programs, and summer camps.
