The CHEST Foundation has been an important resource for members of the American College of Chest Physicians and their patients since its inception in 1996. After 15 successful years, The CHEST Foundation is now poised to better share its resources with the public. The Foundation launched OneBreath: Make The Most Of It in 2010. The OneBreath initiative brings together the three program pillars of The CHEST Foundation-education, care, and community.The aim of OneBreath is to serve as a unifying force for the different medical specialties that form the ACCP community. Drawing from the professional expertise of ACCP members, OneBreath provides a way for the public to benefit from their knowledge of prevention of chest diseases and caring for patients with these diseases. OneBreath.org provides a portal, through The CHEST Foundation, for patients and other people who care about their lung and heart health to access prevention tools, helpful tips, and community-based activities.
