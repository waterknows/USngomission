Ronald McDonald House CharitiesÂ® of Southern California was founded 39 years ago in 1977. The mission of our organization is to provide comfort, care and support to children and families in Southern California. We express this mission primarily through Ronald McDonald Houses located in Los Angeles, Pasadena, Loma Linda, Long Beach, Orange County and Bakersfield, through Camp Ronald McDonald for Good Times, a cost-free sleep away camp for children with cancer and their siblings located in the mountains near Idyllwild, and two Ronald McDonald Family Rooms in Orange County. The Southern California chapter of Ronald McDonald House Charities is the largest in the U.S.
