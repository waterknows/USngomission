Ways to Work is a unique Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) based in Milwaukee, WI. Through our network of 44 loan offices across the country, we provide low-interest loans, financial education, and support to working families with challenging credit histories. We are an alternative to predatory lenders for people with a demonstrated commitment to improving their credit status, moving up in the workforce and achieving increased self-sufficiency. As an asset-building and economic self-sufficiency program for underserved populations without access to conventional financial resources, Ways to Work helps families move off of and stay off welfare and dependency programs. Instead of handouts, it provides families a helping hand-up toward a more stable financial future.
