Teton Science Schools have been teaching about the natural world and the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem since 1967. The organization has educated, trained and inspired thousands of children, youth and adults, bringing them together through the study of nature and its extension, place-based education. Six innovative programs serve students from across Wyoming, the Intermountain West, the nation and around the world. Our programs include educational programs for people of all ages, a graduate program, the Teacher Learning Center, Journeys School, Conservation Research Center, and Wildlife Expeditions.
