Covenant House Missouri (CHMO) empowers homeless, runaway and at-risk youth to live independently and become contributing members of our community. CHMO is an affiliate of Covenant House International, which began in 1969 in a small apartment in Manhattan's East Village. Covenant House came to St. Louis in 1998, starting with a small Outreach program, and expanded to a Community Service Center in 1999, where multiple direct services are provided for at-risk youth ages 16-21. Covenant House Missouri exists because of the enduring support of thousands of individuals who believe, with us, that every youth has a right to the presence of caring adults in her or his life.
