Since 1933, the Humane Society of Memphis & Shelby County has been providing shelter, food and medical care for thousands of unwanted, neglected and abused animals. We offer refuge, medical care, nourishment, and an opportunity for a second chance for life to injured and abused animals; protect animals from cruelty, neglect, carelessness and ignorance; foster a public sentiment of humanity and gentleness toward animals and promote responsible pet ownership through humane education; and enhance the quality of human life with animal companionship.
