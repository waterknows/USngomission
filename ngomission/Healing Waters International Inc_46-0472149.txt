Healing Waters International is a Christian organization serving the poor globally through safe water solutions since 2002. Today we have more than 150 water projects throughout the world and are constantly expanding to serve new countries and regions. Our passion is providing safe water to thirsty communities. We do this by developing low-cost, high-impact water treatment systems that can go anywhere in the world. Each system is accompanied by health and hygiene programs and leadership training to ensure long-term holistic transformation.
