For more than 80 years, the United Way of Tucson and Southern Arizona has held a reputation as our community's fundraiser, but United Way doesn't just raise money. Our mission is to build a better community. We aim for an economically strong, safe and healthy community where southern Arizona residents can live and work. Our strategic goal is to achieve measurable community results in critical areas so that: children will enter school prepared to learn and attend safe, nurturing after-school programs; families will have the tools they need to remain strong and free from violence; and seniors will live actively and make independent life choices.
