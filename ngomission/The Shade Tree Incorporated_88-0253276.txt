Since 1990 The Shade Tree has served homeless and abused women and children, victims of domestic violence, victims of elder abuse, victims of street violence, female veterans, homeless youth and the physically disabled. The mission of The Shade Tree is to provide safe shelter to homeless and abused women and children in crisis and to offer life-changing services promoting stability, dignity, and self-reliance. The Shade Tree is the only 24-hour accessible shelter designed specifically to meet the needs of women and children in Southern Nevada. With 364 permanent beds, The Shade Tree provides some 80,000 nights of shelter each year. To remove any barrier that might prevent a woman from accessing necessary services for herself and her children, 100% of our services are provided completely free of charge, regardless of the length of stay.
