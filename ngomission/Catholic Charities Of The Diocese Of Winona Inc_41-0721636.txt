Believing in the sanctity of the human person and the dignity of human life, Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Winona works to serve all people and make conditions of our Minnesota heartland more fully human by calling people to minister to each other, by reaching out to the disabled, the marginalized, the alienated, and the stranger, and by laboring for the justice which the gospel of Christ demands.
