Boy Scouts of America, Southwest Florida Council, chartered in 1929, prepares young people to make ethical choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Law. The Southwest Florida Council provides a program that is fun for all eligible youth in our Council; and through the values of the Scout Oath and Law develops them into the future leaders of our communities. The Council currently has over 32,000 boys and girls ranging in ages from 7-20 years old involved in their programs. These programs are run by more than 4,000 adult volunteers.
