Founded in 2003, GlobalGiving works to build an efficient, open, thriving marketplace that connects people who have community and world-changing ideas with people who can support them. Our vision is to unleash the potential of people around the world to make positive change happen. GlobalGiving is an online marketplace that connects you to the causes and countries you care about. You select the projects you want to support, make a contribution, and get regular progress updates - so you can see your impact.
