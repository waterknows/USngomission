Founded in 1996, MassINC (The Massachusetts Institute for a New Commonwealth) is an independent, nonpartisan research and educational institute. MassINC is motivated by a vision of a renewed commonwealth where every family can pursue the American Dream. Our mission is to develop a public agenda for Massachusetts that promotes the growth and vitality of the middle class. We see the middle class as the bellwether of our state's social and economic prosperity. Our goal is to make Massachusetts a place of economic opportunity and civic vitality for all its citizens.
