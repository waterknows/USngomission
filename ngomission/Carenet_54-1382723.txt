Care Net was founded in 1975 as the Christian Action Council by renowned scholar Dr. Harold O. J. Brown, with its primary focus to engage evangelicals in responding to the abortion crisis. Today, Care Net has grown to become one of the largest networks of pregnancy centers in North America, with more than 1,100 centers serving over 370,000 women each year. As Care Net has grown, so has our mission. Care Net ministers to women through our 24/7 Option Line call center and website. A joint venture with Heartbeat International, Option Line has become one of the most effective ways to reach the most abortion-vulnerable segment of women - 18-24 year olds - particularly on the internet.
