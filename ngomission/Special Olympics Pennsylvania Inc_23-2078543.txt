Special Olympics of Pennsylvania (SOPA) became an official chapter of Special Olympics, Inc. in 1970. SOPA provides year-round athletic training and athletic competition in over 20 Olympic-type sports for individuals with intellectual disabilities and provides them with continuing opportunities to develop physical fitness skills, express courage, experience joy, and participate in the sharing of gifts, skills, and friendship with their families, other Special Olympics athletes, and the community. Over 20,000 children and adults with intellectual disabilities and closely related developmental disabilities participate in over 300 local, sectional, and state events. Athletes range in age from eight to 80 and are of all ability levels.
