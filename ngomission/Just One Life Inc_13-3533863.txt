Just One Life/Nefesh Achat B'Yisrael was formed in 1989 by a group of community leaders, Rabbis and social workers in New York and in Jerusalem. Its focus is the Israeli family who is faced with the dilemma of an untimely or medically at risk pregnancy. When pregnant women are grappling with difficult choices, it is important for them to know that they are not alone, that there is an organization that they can turn to for assistance. Nefesh Achat has set for itself the goal of providing a safety net and a listening ear to pregnant women who are confronted with financial, emotional or medical difficulties.
