Founded in 1899, the Maine Children's Home for Little Wanderers builds and strengthens families and their children, instilling hope for the future and a better quality of life. It is a multi-faceted organization that has grown to meet the evolving needs of those it serves. Our services include: The Hague-accredited Adoption Program, the longest-operating program of its kind in Maine, offering domestic and international adoption services, home studies, post adoption, and birth parent services, as well as The Children's Place, delivering early care and education to children 6 weeks old to age 5.
