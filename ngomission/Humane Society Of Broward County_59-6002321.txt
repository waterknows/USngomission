Established in 1944, the Humane Society of Broward County provides shelter, aid and responsible adoptions to animals entrusted to our care, and educates the community about respect and kindness to all animals. The shelter is 33,000 square-feet with the ability to house over 300 dogs and cats. The society has full time veterinarian services for shelter animals with an on site clinic. Over 200,000 patrons visit the shelter each year. In fiscal year 2007, the society placed 9,923 animals into new homes; and our educational programs touched over 150,000 children and adults.
