Established in 1978, Mingei International Museum is dedicated to the understanding and appreciation of 'art of the people' (mingei) from all cultures of the world. This art shares a direct simplicity and reflects a joy in making, by hand, useful objects of timeless beauty that are satisfying to the human spirit. The Museum collects, conserves and exhibits these arts of daily life by unknown craftsmen of ancient times; from traditional cultures of past and present; and by historical and contemporary designers. The Museum's collection now comprises 23,000 objects of folk art, craft and design from 141 countries.
