Florida's Children First (FCF) was founded in 2001 by attorneys from across Florida who were working on issues affecting Florida's most vulnerable children. Our primary work is with children in state custody. We also work on issues for children who have disabilities and children who are immigrants. FCF staff, board members, volunteers, and advocates devote their time to ensure that each child in care or in an at-risk situation will have a voice that is heard when decisions are made. We use legislative and policy advocacy, executive branch education and advocacy, training and technical assistance to lawyers and Guardians Ad Litem representing children, public awareness, and filing of amicus briefs as strategies to improve child serving systems.
