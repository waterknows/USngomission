Incorporated in 1992, Mercy Flight Central (MFC) is an independent organization of air medical professionals, devoted to integrity and compassion, providing critical care to the sick and injured. We provide air medical services to New York State and beyond. We will respond to all requests to provide treatment and transport to adult, pediatric and neonatal patient populations, in both the pre-hospital and interfacility settings, unless a specific condition exists that is expressly defined by other company policies where it has been determined that other methods of treatment and/or transport would be more appropriate for that specific type of patient.
