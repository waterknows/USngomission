The Tiger Athletic Foundation ("TAF") is a private, nonprofit corporation dedicated to supporting LSU and its Athletic Program. As the primary source of private funding for LSU athletics, TAF's mission is clear - to lead the university in building a comprehensively superior athletic program. Contributions to TAF benefit every athlete and every team at LSU through scholarship and academic awards, as well as through the construction and maintenance of athletic facilities. These projects, large and small, chart the unmistakable course to excellence. And it is the shared vision of alumni and friends of LSU that are making excellence a reality at LSU.
