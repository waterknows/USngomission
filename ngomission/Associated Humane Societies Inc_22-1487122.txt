The Associated Humane Societies, founded in 1906, is the largest animal sheltering system in New Jersey. We comprise three shelters located in Newark, Forked River, and Tinton Falls. Our Forked River facility also includes Popcorn Park Zoo. Established in 1977, Popcorn Park Zoo is a sanctuary for abandoned, injured, ill, exploited, abused or elderly wildlife, exotic and farm animals, and birds. The mission of the Associated Humane Societies, including Popcorn Park Zoo, is to consistently provide the highest quality of care to all animals, domestic and wildlife, including their rescue, housing, veterinary care, placement whenever possible, and when required, a peaceful end. It is also our mission to prevent cruelty to all animals, primarily in New Jersey, but also throughout the United States.
