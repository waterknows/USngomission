Sower of Seeds International Ministries facilitates and operates compassion outreaches to India, with a focus on social development. We are committed to searching for and developing not only sustainable life-saving solutions, but also truly life-changing ones to the problems the poor face every day. It is our heart to encourage and empower the local church to be a solution in their community. Our goal is to be a bridge, connecting you to world missions in a way that is measurable and full of impact, making an eternal difference in the lives of others.
