The Yellowstone Art Museum exhibits, interprets, collects, and preserves art, with an emphasis on Montana and surrounding regions, for the enrichment, education, inspiration, and enjoyment of all. We value ART. We value imagination and the passionate education of enthusiastic and curious minds of all ages. We value a diverse community that cherishes its memories and aspires to an exceptional future. We value a place to live that is enhanced through engaging art of uncompromising quality.
