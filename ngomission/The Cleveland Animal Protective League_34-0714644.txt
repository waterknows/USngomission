The Cleveland Animal Protective League's (APL) mission is to foster compassion and end animal suffering. Incorporated in 1913, it is a private, independent humane society that is located in Cleveland's Tremont neighborhood. The APL's Humane Investigations team investigates reports of animal cruelty in Cuyahoga County and assists with the prosecution of those cases. The APL provides shelter to animals that have been relinquished by their guardians or rescued by the APL from abuse or neglect, and to stray or abandoned cats. It has achieved 100 percent placement of healthy, friendly animals. The APL also provides veterinary care to sick or injured animals that are admitted into our shelter, can be safely and humanely treated, rehabilitated in foster homes, and then placed into loving homes. The APL offers outreach programs in the community that reduce the birthrate of unwanted litters of cats and dogs and provide resources and support to pet owners in targeted, under-served areas.
