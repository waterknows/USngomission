California Trout (CalTrout) was initially founded in January 1971 by avid trout fishermen and steelhead devotees to protect and restore wild trout and steelhead waters throughout California. CalTrout was the nation's first statewide conservation group supported by trout fishermen with an altruistic goal: to restore trout and protect the beautiful places where they live. CalTrout has three long range goals: protect and restore vulnerable habitat areas or pockets, protect and restore water flows for wild trout and steelhead, and ensure effective state wild trout and steelhead management.
