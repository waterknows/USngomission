The purposes for which the Art Institute of Chicago (AIC) was formed in 1879 are: to found, build, maintain, and operate museums, schools, libraries of art, and theaters; to provide support facilities in connection therewith; to conduct appropriate activities conducive to the artistic development of the region; and to conduct and participate in appropriate activities of national and international significance. The AIC encompasses both the museum and the school. The School is one of the largest accredited independent schools of art and design in the country, providing degrees at the undergraduate and graduate levels. The museum's collection now encompasses more than 5,000 years of human expression from cultures around the world.
