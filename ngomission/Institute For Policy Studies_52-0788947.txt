Since 1963, the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS) has served as a policy and research resource for visionary social justice movements for four decades: from the anti-war and civil rights movements in the 1960's to the peace and global justice movements of the last decade. The Institute for Policy Studies is the counterweight to the dealmakers. We work to reclaim democracy. We collaborate with grassroots movements to foster the conditions for long-term change. We promote relationships, linking activists and public officials who share our belief that a better world is possible, We launch inform and sustain democratic movements. The Institute's work is organized into over a dozen projects, reflecting our public scholars' diverse areas of expertise. In practice, these projects collaborate strategically to pursue three overarching policy goals: peace, justice and the environment.
