Achilles International's mission is to enable people with all types of disabilities to participate in mainstream athletics in order to promote personal achievement, enhance self esteem, and lower barriers to living a fulfilling life. Achilles was founded in 1983 by Dick Traum, the first amputee to run the New York City Marathon. Today, Achilles has chapters and members in over 65 locations within the United States and abroad. Able-bodied volunteers and disabled runners come together to train in an environment of support and community. Over time, runners gain measurable physical strength and build confidence and self- esteem as they begin to achieve, which leads to increased levels of aspiration in all areas of life.
