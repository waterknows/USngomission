Founded in 1993, Neighborhood Development Center (NDC) works to empower entrepreneurs and community partners to transform low income neighborhood economies from within. NDC works with entrepreneurs and community organizations to concentrate the power of micro-enterprise development around dynamic "hubs" of community revitalization, linking the energy of people to the vitality of places. This "network of hubs" allows NDC to generate and sustain large-scale impact while communities retain ownership of the process and the results.
