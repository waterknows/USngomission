The Denison Pequotsepos Nature Center (DNPC) provides visitors and the greater Mystic community the opportunity to experience nature first hand through miles of trails, in our natural history museum, our Nature Store, or as part of one of our many programs. Our mission is to inspire an understanding of the natural world and ourselves as part of it â€“ past, present and future. It is our hope that through DPNC and Coogan Farm that we will help our visitors foster a personal environmental ethic.
