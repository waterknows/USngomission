Founded in 1995 as Adventures For Wish Kids, A Kid Again provides hope, happiness and healing to families raising kids with life threatening illness. We provide fun filled activities and destination events, which we call adventures at no cost to families. Our year round adventures foster laughter, joy, normalcy and supportive networking opportunities. Our family centric approach allows for a broader more comprehensive impact on the effects of a coping with a life threatening illness in the family. Our events allow families to give illness a GIANT Time Out!
