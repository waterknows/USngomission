The Humane Society of Indianapolis (IndyHumane) is the leading voice for the welfare of animals and improving their quality of life. Our vision is that all central Indiana animals are treated with dignity and respect and live free from cruelty, harm and neglect. IndyHumane is the first choice in providing direct services for shelter cats and dogs, including adoption, foster home placement, behavior training, appropriate medical care, and affordable spay/neuter services. As the voice for the animals, IndyHumane brings together like-minded animal-focused individuals and groups to educate the public about animal welfare issues and concerns. For over 100 years, it's all about the animals.
