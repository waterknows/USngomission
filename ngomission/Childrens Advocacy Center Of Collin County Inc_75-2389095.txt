The mission of Children's Advocacy Center of Collin County (CACCC) is to provide safety, healing and justice for children victimized by abuse or neglect. CACCC works together with a multi-disciplinary team to investigate, treat, and prosecute child abuse cases within Collin County in addition to providing a safe place for children to tell their stories and begin to heal. Since its inception in 1992, the Center has offered services to over 50,000 children and their non-offending family members free of charge.
