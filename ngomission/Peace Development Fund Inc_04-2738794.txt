The Peace Development Fund (PDF) works to build the capacity of community-based organizations through grants, training, and other resources as partners in human rights and social justice movements. PDF was founded in 1981 when a small group of donor activists came together with a common vision of funding social justice and peace through a public foundation. PDF was founded on the belief that lasting change will come only when a large amount of people are well informed and empowered to make change. PDF has always believed that true democratic change must take place from the bottom up. That change can only endure with citizens who are both informed and clear about what they believe.
