Urgent Action Fund for Women's Human Rights is a rapid response fund that supports women's LGBTQ human rights defenders as they create cultures of justice, equality and peace. Using online, voicemail, and SMS-based funding applications, Urgent Action Fund responds to all requests within 24 to 72 hours, and grantees have funds in hand within one to seven days. Urgent Action Fund's rapid response grants support the resilience of movements by protecting activists who face immediate threats and by supporting advocacy when windows of opportunity emerge to set new legal or policy precedents. Since its founding, Urgent Action Fund has awarded more than 1,300 rapid response grants, totaling more than $5 million, to advance women's and LGBTQ human rights in 110 countries worldwide.
