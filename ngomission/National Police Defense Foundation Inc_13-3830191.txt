The National Police Defense Foundation (NPDF) works to provide important medical and legal support services to the national law enforcement community, and also administers several NPDF law enforcement programs involving public safety and child safety programs. The NPDF provides free medical support services to law enforcement personnel regarding job related illnesses and disabilities. NPDF's programs include Safe Cop, which posts rewards for public information leading to the arrest and conviction of any person shooting a member of law enforcement; and the Operation Kids program, which funds project pedophile, distributes free child fingerprint kits, posts periodic rewards on missing children; funds youth athletic events; issues scholarship for criminal justice students; and advances life saving operations for critically ill children.
