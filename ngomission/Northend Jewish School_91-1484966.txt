Founded in 2001, Seattle Jewish Community School (SJCS) provides an exceptional integrated education through the lens of the Jewish experience. Grounded in community and an ethos of intellectual rigor, we raise our students to develop thoughtful inquiry, courageous and compassionate connection to others and a strong sense of who they are. SJCS graduates will apply their individual strengths to engage thoughtfully and confidently with the world as advocates for and architects of their Jewish and global communities.
