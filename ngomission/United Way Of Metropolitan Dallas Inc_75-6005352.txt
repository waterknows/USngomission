For more than 80 years, United Way of Metropolitan Dallas has been fiercely committed to building strong, successful families and a better North Texas. United Way is the region's premiere charitable organization because volunteer-led assessments assure the wisest investment of donor dollars. The result is diverse programs that make a difference in the lives of your co-workers, neighbors, friends, family, and others in need. Currently, United Way works with our partners to deliver nearly 400 programs and hundreds of services that target community needs centered around the building blocks for a good life: a quality education that leads to stable employment, sufficient income to support a family through retirement, and sound mental and physical health.
