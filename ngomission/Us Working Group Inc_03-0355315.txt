Forest Stewardship Council-U.S. (FSC-US) is the U.S. chapter of FSC International, an organization devoted to encouraging the responsible management of the world's forests. FSC was created in 1993 to change the dialogue about and the practice of sustainable forestry worldwide. FSC sets high standards that ensure forestry is practiced in an environmentally responsible, socially beneficial, and economically viable way. FSC-U.S. coordinates the development of forest management standards throughout the different biogeographic regions of the U.S., provides public information about certification and FSC, and works with certification organizations to promote FSC certification in the U.S.
