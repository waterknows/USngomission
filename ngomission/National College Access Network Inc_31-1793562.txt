Founded in 1995, the mission of the National College Access Network (NCAN) is to build, strengthen, and empower communities committed to college access and success so that all students, especially those underrepresented in postsecondary education, can achieve their educational dreams. NCAN provides member organizations with professional development, networking, benchmarking, and news from the field so they can deliver these services more effectively and to more students. Resources include conferences, webinars, and online tools such as guidebooks and manuals as well periodic regrants to implement new initiatives.
