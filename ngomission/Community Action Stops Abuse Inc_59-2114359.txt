Community Action Stops Abuse (CASA), has been working in the Tampa Bay area since 1977 providing refuge, crisis intervention, advocacy, professional training and community outreach to break the silence that isolates victims of domestic violence and prevents them from a life of hope, independence and peace. CASA staff members understand the courage it takes to disclose abuse, and they work with the community to build a network of support for survivors and their children.
