Chess-in-the-Schools is dedicated to improving academic performance and building self-esteem among inner-city public school children. Since 1986, Chess-in-the-Schools has taught, inspired, and empowered more than 450,000 students in New York City public schools. All schools served by Chess-in-the-Schools are classified as Title I. In these schools, more than 40% of the students are eligible for free or reduced cost lunch (an indicator of socio-economic disadvantage.) Through structured classroom, after-school, weekend, and summer programs, we use chess as an educational tool to promote learning and to help young people develop skills in critical thinking and problem solving.
