The Center for Mind-Body Medicine combines modern science, wise tradition, and human connection to create a powerful new medicine centered on a simple concept - self-care. We are teaching thousands to heal millions - and by teaching the teachers first, we see individuals, families and communities everywhere reconnecting with themselves and one another to embrace the richness of our human experience. The Center teaches scientifically-validated mind-body medicine techniques that enhance each person's capacity for self-awareness and self-care to health professionals around the world, including those in traumatized communities in the greatest need.
