ProJeCt of Easton, Inc. works to help people help themselves. ProJeCt offers comprehensive emergency assistance and language and literacy services to over 5,000 community residents each year. ProJeCt offers a number of programs to serve both children and adults, but all of our services share the same goal - to help individuals and families achieve self-sufficiency. ProJeCt envisions a community where people can realize their potential and achieve self-sufficiency not limited by economic disadvantage, language and learning differences, under-education, home environment or poverty.
