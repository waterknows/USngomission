Founded in 1953, the Minnesota International Center (MIC) is a nonpartisan organization dedicated to supporting Minnesota's growing interest and involvement in the world. Our mission is to inspire our community to understand global issues and cultures in an ever changing world. MIC does this by providing international education opportunities to open global doors for our community, allowing the people of Minnesota and visitors from around the world to meet - both formally and informally - and learn about and from one another. Each of MIC's four program areas endeavors to organize and facilitate learning experiences for children and adults alike. Activities range from formal lectures to small group discussions to mealtime conversation, and occur on-site in K-12 classrooms, the workplace, homes and the community.
