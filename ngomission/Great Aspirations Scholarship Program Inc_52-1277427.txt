Founded in 1983, GRASP is a college-access organization that assists students and families in obtaining funding for post-secondary education. GRASP will help students and their families, regardless of their financial resources and at no charge to them, develop an educational plan. Our goal is to ensure that every student has an equal opportunity for continuing education after high school, regardless of financial or social circumstances.
