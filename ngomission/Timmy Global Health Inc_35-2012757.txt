Timmy Global Health expands access to healthcare and empowers students and volunteers to tackle today's most pressing global health challenges. To achieve this goal, Timmy sends medical service teams to support the work of international partner organizations, channels financial, medical, and human resources to community based health and development projects, and works to empower students at U.S. high schools and colleges to fundraise, advocate, and serve in an effort to fight health disparities at home and abroad.
