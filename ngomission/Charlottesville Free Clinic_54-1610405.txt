Founded in 1992, the Charlottesville Free Clinic works to provide a volunteer community health-support system that offers high-quality health care to the working uninsured population, which would otherwise have no access to care; to provide practical experience for current and future health care professionals; and to hasten, through education and advocacy, the creation of a comprehensive policy for access to health care. We offer free medical care, dental care, and medications for low-income and low-income uninsured adults between the ages of 19-64 and their families in and around Charlottesville.
