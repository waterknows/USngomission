The Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Community Center of Colorado (the Center) opened in 1976 and over the years has grown to become the largest community center in the Rocky Mountain region, giving voice to Colorado's LGBT community and playing a pivotal role in statewide initiatives to reduce harassment and discrimination. Today, we are focused on fulfilling our mission - To engage, empower, enrich, and advance the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community of Colorado - by ensuring that every member of the LGBT community has access to the programs and resources they need to live happy, healthy, and productive lives.
