Founded in 1981 by Robert Redford, the Sundance Institute is dedicated to the discovery and development of independent artists and audiences. Through its programs, the Institute seeks to discover, support, and inspire independent film and theatre artists from the United States and around the world, and to introduce audiences to their new work. The Institute's programs include the annual Sundance Film Festival, the Feature Film Program, the Documentary Film Program, the Film Music Program, the Theatre Program, the Independent Producers Conference, and the Native American Initiative. The Institute also maintains the Sundance Collection at UCLA to conserve and archive the history of independent film.
