Founded in 1982, The Sunshine Kids Foundation adds quality of life to children with cancer by providing them with exciting, positive group activities, so they may once again do what Kids are meant to do . . . have fun and celebrate life! Young cancer patients participate in positive group activities which promote self-esteem, personal accomplishment and just plain old fashioned fun. Thousands of children from hospitals across the country have benefited from The Sunshine Kids Foundation's many programs and national and regional events. The Sunshine Kids continues, as it has since its inception, to provide all of its activities completely free of charge to the children, their families and hospitals.
