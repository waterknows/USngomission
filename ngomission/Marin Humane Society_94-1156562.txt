Founded in 1907, the Marin Humane Society is a progressive, award-winning animal shelter, offering refuge and rehabilitation to nearly 8,000 animals each year through a myriad of community services, including adoptions, foster care, behavior and training, humane education, lost-and-found pet services, low-cost clinics, and more. In addition to the organization's role as animal shelter, MHS is responsible for the county's animal services. Since 1979, county and municipal animal services ordinances have been enforced by MHS through a Joint Powers Agreement (JPA) contract with the County of Marin. Today, nearly 100 staff and 800 volunteers care for nearly 9,000 homeless animals each year and assist all of Marin's residents with their animal needs.
