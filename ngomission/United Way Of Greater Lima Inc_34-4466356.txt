With roots tracing back to 1884, it is the purpose of the United Way of Greater Lima to mobilize and stimulate the interest and participation of the citizens of Greater Lima on behalf of worthy nonprofit charitable, health, welfare, or allied purpose organizations. The United Way of Greater Lima solicits, receives, and distributes contributions for partner agencies based on a volunteer review of programs, finances, performance, and the improvement of lives in Allen County. The United Way works in collaboration with government, business and community partners to better the lives of children and families, and to raise awareness of community needs and available services.
