The mission of LIFE International is to multiply Christ-centered, life-giving ministries wherever abortion exists or the sanctity of human life is diminished. Our purpose in this work is to see people receive new life in Christ and human lives fully restored to their God-given value. Our day-in and day-out focus is to equip, empower, and release leaders for life-giving ministry worldwide. We seek to equip the Church to bring a Gospel-centered, life-affirming message to the world and walk in her God-given authority to defend life and rescue those being led away to death (Proverbs 24:11).
