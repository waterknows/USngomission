Founded in 1973 by several Christian churches, Crisis Control Ministry is a Christian-based ministry whose mission is to assist people in crisis to meet essential life needs and to become self-sufficient. At Crisis Control Ministry, we strive to assist our neighbors who face financial crises which impede the fulfillment of basic life needs, including housing, utilities, food, and prescription medications. We also aim to support our clients' efforts to regain self-sufficiency. Our roots are in Christianity, but our reach has never been limited to Christians. People of all backgrounds and beliefs come to Crisis Control to volunteer and to receive services. We are joined together in the common quest for help and hope.
