Spirit of America's mission is to support the safety and success of Americans serving abroad and the local people and partners they seek to help. Spirit of America is the only nonprofit organization that directly supports the safety and success of deployed US personnel.Since being founded in 2003, we have provided millions in targeted assistance to help US troops and diplomats assist vulnerable local people in Africa, the Middle East, Central and South Asia and Latin America: Afghanistan, Colombia, Djibouti, Guyana, Honduras, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, the Maldives, Mali, Mauritania, Pakistan, Peru, Syria, Tajikistan and Yemen.We've established a groundbreaking model for partnership of a nonprofit organization with the US government. Our support is fast, flexible and decentralized. It makes our troops and diplomats safer and more successful. It helps them improve security and stability, build goodwill, and increase the wellbeing of those most at risk of extremism and conflict.
