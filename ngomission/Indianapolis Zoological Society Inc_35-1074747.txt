The mission of the Indianapolis Zoo is to empower people and communities, both locally and globally, to advance animal conservation. To this end, we see ourselves as a conservation organization that operates a zoo as a key engagement and outreach strategy. The Zoo provides engaging exhibits throughout five biomes (Oceans, Deserts, Forests, Plains and Encounters). Each new exhibit is designed to provide an up-close encounter with the animal, and information that will enlighten guests about current conservation issues, empowering them to take personal action.
