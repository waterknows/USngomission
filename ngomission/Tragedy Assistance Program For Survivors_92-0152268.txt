Founded out of tragedy in 1994, Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS) has grown and established itself as the front line resource to families and loved ones of our military men and women. TAPS has provided comfort and care, 24 hours a day, seven days a week through comprehensive services and programs including peer based emotional support, case work assistance, crisis intervention, and grief and trauma resources. TAPS has assisted over 40,000 surviving family members, casualty officers and caregivers. Our National Military Survivor Seminars and Good Grief Camps have been conducted for nineteen years, and are complemented by regional seminars across the country.
