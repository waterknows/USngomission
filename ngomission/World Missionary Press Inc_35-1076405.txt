Founded in 1961, World Missionary Press is an interdenominational faith ministry producing 48-page topical Scripture booklets in more than 328 languages, along with Bible study booklets and New Testaments in a variety of languages. We are producing approximately six million Scripture booklets each month to send out free of charge as the Lord enables us financially. During our 47 years of ministry we have sent literature by request into 210 countries and islands of the world.
