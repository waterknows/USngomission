The Mill River Park Collaborative is a partnership of civic, government, and business interests committed to creating and sustaining the Mill River Park & Greenway. By working to build support from local businesses and combining it with investments from the city, state and federal governments, the Collaborative aims to build and maintain a vibrant, world-class green space for the Stamford community. The Collaborative began the process for creating Mill River Park in 2004. Since then, the design team, the Army Corps of Engineers and various city departments have worked to design and build the park under the direction of the Collaborative's Executive Director.
