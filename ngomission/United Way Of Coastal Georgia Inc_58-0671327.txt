United Way of Coastal Georgia (UWCGA) brings together people and resources to build a safety net to help meet the needs of our friends, neighbors, co-workers and families. A volunteer driven organization, UWCGA is helping make a difference in our communities by creating meaningful and tangible impact. As the leading facilitator of community enrichment for Glynn and McIntosh counties, UWCGA envisions mobilizing the caring power of communities to improve people's lives by investing in the building blocks of a good life: a quality education that leads to a stable job, enough income to support a family through retirement, and good health.
