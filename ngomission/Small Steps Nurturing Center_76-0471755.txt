Small Steps' mission is to provide an exemplary early childhood program to instill and foster the social, emotional, physical, intellectual, and spiritual growth of economically at-risk children and their families. We operate two preschools for economically at-risk students living in the First, Second, Fourth, and Fifth Wards of Houston, Texas. Small Steps provides a high-quality education, a nurturing Christian environment, transportation, nutritious meals, and social and emotional therapy to 174 economically at-risk children, ages two through six. We invest in the lives of these children through meeting their needs, intervening early, and setting them on a trajectory filled with greater opportunities. Small Steps also invests in the community through establishing a relationship with the students' families, holding parent education meetings, and connecting families with other social services available in the community.
