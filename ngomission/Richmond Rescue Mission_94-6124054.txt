Since 1965, the Bay Area Rescue Mission has been caring for the homeless and impoverished of the Bay Area. At the Bay Area Rescue Mission, we offer help for the whole person by providing food, shelter, warm showers and fresh clean clothes for the body; a gospel message of eternal hope for the soul; Biblical studies, computer-aided learning, and GED preparation for the mind; job skills training in culinary arts, warehousing, heavy equipment operation, office work, construction, security, janitorial service, and automotive sales and service for the hands; parenting classes, job preparedness, anger management, counseling, and personal financial management classes for the character; and compassion, friendship, fellowship, retreats, outings, and prayer meetings for the heart.
