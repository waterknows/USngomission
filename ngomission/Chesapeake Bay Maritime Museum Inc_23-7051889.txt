Founded in 1965, the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum is dedicated to furthering an interest, understanding, and appreciation of the culture and maritime heritage of the Chesapeake Bay and its environs through collection, education, documentation, exhibition, research, and publication. On permanent display is the nation's most complete collection of Chesapeake Bay artifacts, visual arts, and indigenous water craft. Interpretive exhibitions and public programs cover the range of Bay maritime history and culture-including Native-American life, Anglo-American settlement, seventeenth- and eighteenth-century trans-Atlantic trade, naval history, the Bay's unique watercraft and boat building traditions, navigation, waterfowling, boating, seafood harvesting, and recreation.
