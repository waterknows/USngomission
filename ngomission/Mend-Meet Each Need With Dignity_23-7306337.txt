MEND-Meet Each Need with Dignity, which serves as many as 30,000 poverty-level clients each month while remarkably keeping operating costs to 5%, is the largest, most efficient and comprehensive poverty-relief organization in the San Fernando Valley. MEND takes a holistic approach to relieve the effects of poverty by providing basic human needs while giving their clients the tools, education, training, support and opportunities that foster self-reliance.MEND was born as a volunteer-powered organization four decades ago in a garage in suburban LA and today benefits from the assistance of more than 3000 volunteers (and only 25 paid staffers) to implement its vast array of programs that provide food, clothing, medical, dental and vision care; job training, classes in ESL, literacy, computers, office skills, sewing and parenting; math, reading and science tutoring for kids; hot meals, food, clothing and showers to the homeless and a community wide Adopt-a-Family Christmas Program.
