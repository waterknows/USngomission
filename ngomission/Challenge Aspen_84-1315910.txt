Challenge Aspen is dedicated to impacting the lives by presenting meaningful recreational, educational and cultural experiences to individuals faced with cognitive or physical challenges. Through the years, seasonal camps have become a large outreach of Challenge Aspen, and the fun includes a mono-ski camp and a rock climbing camp for paraplegics and amputees, a ski festival for the visually impaired, and children's art and music camps in the summertime. The aim of Challenge Aspen is to carefully orchestrate life changing adventures, giving participants the courage to learn something new, trust their own abilities and carry that ideal forward, reaching toward goals in other areas of their lives.
