The Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center (FAC) is a place for artistic discovery and entertainment. Founded in 1936, the FAC is an art museum, performing arts theatre, and arts education center. Our vision is to be a cultural and economic anchor, providing innovative, world-class programming to an ever-expanding audience. The school trains and educates individuals in a variety of art techniques; the art museum, FAC Modern, provides for the display, care and preservation of various artworks and related items; and the performing arts and theatre company programs promote art, dance, drama, and other performing arts. The FAC served approximately 100,000 people in 2008.
