Appalachia Service Project (ASP) is a Christian ministry, open to all people, that fosters human development by addressing the housing needs of Central Appalachia. Each year through our ministry about 15,000 volunteers repair homes for 400-500 low-income families in rural areas of Central Appalachia. Our goal is to make homes warmer, safer and drier for families in need, while offering transformational experiences for families, volunteers and staff alike. Since our founding in 1969, over 260,000 volunteers from across the nation have repaired 14,000 homes. Appalachia Service Project serves the mountainous Central Appalachian region where Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia come together.
