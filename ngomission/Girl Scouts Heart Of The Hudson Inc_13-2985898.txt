Girl Scouts Heart of the Hudson, Inc (GSHH) was formed in October of 2007 as a result of merging five area Girl Scout councils in the mid and lower Hudson River Valley of New York State. Since the early days of Girl Scouting, Girl Scouts has been providing girls with extraordinary programming throughout the region. Currently, we serve over 32,000 girls in grades K through 12 and 15,000 adult volunteers. In Girl Scouts Heart of the Hudson's geographic area, there are over 3,400 troops and groups providing Girl Scout program activities on a regular basis. GSHH maintains nine Girl Scouts houses, four regional offices, a central administrative office and six camp properties. GSHH is committed to providing Girl Scouting to as many girls as possible in our jurisdiction all year 'round. GSHH is a tax-exempt, not-for-profit corporation organized under the laws of the State of New York.
