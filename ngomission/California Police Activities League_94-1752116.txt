The California Police Activities League (PAL) was founded over 35 years ago by a group of police officers. These dedicated police officers and sheriffs deputies from various cities and counties throughout the state would meet together twice a year to share ideas, information and procedures from their local PAL chapters and to promote the California PAL concept. In 1991, California PAL expanded its mission to engage youth by bringing together youth teams from local member PAL's throughout the state. From its humble beginnings, California PAL has grown into an organization that makes a positive difference in the youth of California and strives to continue making a strong contribution in reducing juvenile crime and creating a safer environment within the State of California.
