Founded in 1992, the Concord Coalition is a grassroots, non-partisan organization, which works to provide citizens information about federal budget and entitlement policy. We believe that an informed electorate will demand fiscal responsibility of their elected leaders. The Concord Coalition is dedicated to educating the public about the causes and consequences of federal budget deficits, the long-term challenges facing America's unsustainable entitlement programs, and how to build a sound economy for future generations. The Concord Coalition's national field staff and loyal group of volunteers cover the country, holding lectures, interactive exercises, conducting classes, giving media interviews, and briefing elected officials and their staffs.
