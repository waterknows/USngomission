Dress for Success is an international not-for-profit organization that promotes the economic independence of disadvantaged women by providing professional attire, a network of support and the career development tools to help women thrive in work and in life. We do this by addressing every phase of a woman's career. Whether she's unemployed and searching; recently employed and adjusting; or gainfully employed and succeeding, Dress for Success is there every step of the way on her path to self-sufficiency. This continuum of services, including our popular suiting program, was established to streamline this success journey, so that the women we serve may evolve into leaders in the workforce, as well as leaders in life, effectively and efficiently. Since we opened our doors in New York City in 1997, we have grown into an organization that can be found in 140 cities throughout 20 countries. Through this expansive reach, we are proud to have served more than 850,000 women around the world.
