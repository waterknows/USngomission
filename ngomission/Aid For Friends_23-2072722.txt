Aid For Friends' mission is to serve needy, isolated shut-ins, primarily the frail elderly, in the five county Greater Philadelphia area, with free daily home-cooked meals delivered weekly by empathetic volunteer visitors, and also to provide shut-ins with free outreach services. The goal is to help our homebound client/friends maintain their cherished independence by supporting their determination to remain in their own homes for as long as possible and to enhance their quality of life. Since our inception in 1974 - we have delivered more than 13 million free meals to over 11,900 shut-ins. Our visitors have volunteered more than 1.5 million hours of compassionate visiting with their shut-in client/friends.
