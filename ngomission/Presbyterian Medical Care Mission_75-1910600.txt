The Medical Care Mission exists to provide, in a Christian setting, quality health care to persons in the Abilene area. Although the Mission was established by the Presbyterian Church in 1983, it is an ecumenical ministry that receives widespread support throughout the community from a variety of faith congregations, community organizations and individuals. The Presbyterian Medical Care Mission is a family clinic, and their two full-time physicians serve as general practitioners for their patients. Their services are available to people who do not have private insurance, Medicaid, or Medicare.
