The Boy Scouts of America, Central Georgia Council is one of the largest councils in Georgia geographically, serving 24 counties of middle Georgia. Over 5,600 youth are served each year in programs from first grade through high school. About 1,800 adult volunteers serve Scouting under the guidance of a volunteer board of directors and a relatively small professional staff of six. Through Scouting programs, students are taught honesty, importance of service to others and skills that help define one's personal value system.
