Boy Scouts of America, Black Warrior Council provides youth with programs and activities that allow them to try new things, provide service to others, build self-confidence, and reinforce ethical standards. Scouting helps youth develop academic skills, self-confidence, ethics, leadership skills, and citizenship skills that influence their adult lives. Scouting promotes activities that lead to personal responsibility and high self-esteem. As a result, when hard decisions have to be made, peer pressure can be resisted and the right choices can be made.
