Founded in 1976, House of Ruth helps women, children and families in greatest need and with very limited resources build safe, stable lives and achieve their highest potential. Here, women, children and families heal from lifetimes of traumatic abuse. At our 13 sites in Washington, DC, we assess the capacities and needs of each woman and child, then design and deliver a specialized combination of services to meet their needs and build on their strengths. We enfold the women and families in a safe and structured environment, where they receive highly responsive and caring attention from the staff. Every day at House of Ruth, more than 600 women and children work hard to learn the skills to live independently and eliminate homelessness and abuse from their lives. They participate at 11 residential programs, a developmental day care center and a free counseling program for domestic violence survivors.
