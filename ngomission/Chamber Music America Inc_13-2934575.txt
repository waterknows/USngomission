The mission of Chamber Music America (CMA) is to develop and strengthen an evolving chamber music community. Our vision is that chamber music will become a vital and recognized presence in contemporary American culture. Founded in 1977, CMA values a passion for chamber music in all of its manifestations; a commitment to a diverse membership, embracing performers and audiences at every level of experience, knowledge, and ability; support of the chamber music professional and the encouragement of excellence; collaboration, and chamber music's potential to exemplify democracy, tolerance, and humanity; and respect for tradition, experimentation, and innovation.
