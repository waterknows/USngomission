Founded in 1981, the Project On Government Oversight (POGO) is an independent organization that investigates and exposes corruption and other misconduct in order to achieve a more accountable federal government. POGO's work is unique in that our goal is not only to expose corruption and other types of misconduct within the federal government, but also to propose solutions and work toward their implementation. We evaluate our impact by looking at whether or not policy reforms or spending cuts have been implemented as a result of our investigations.
