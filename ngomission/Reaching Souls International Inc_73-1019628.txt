Reaching Souls International, formerly Jimmy Hodges Ministries International, was founded in 1986 with the goal of training Africans to reach Africa for Christ. We proclaim the Gospel to emerging nations by loving, reaching, training, equipping and multiplying the laborers. In a lost and dying nation, Christian pastors cry out to be trained for a life time of effective and powerful ministry. Reaching Souls is answering this cry. Native pastors walk, hitch-hike, peddle and paddle their way to our Leadership Development Institutes in six African nations and India. When they arrive they receive intense and exciting training, a new Bible in their own language, and a vibrant new ministry.
