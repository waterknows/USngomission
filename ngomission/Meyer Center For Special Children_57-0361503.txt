The Meyer Center for Special Children's mission is to provide quality education and certified therapy services to preschool children with disabilities. The Meyer Center aims to enrich the lives of children with disabilities so they reach their maximum potential. By delivering quality education and proper therapy, we can put each child on the road to success. Unlocking the potential that lies in each child regardless of disabilities, setbacks, or circumstances is at the heart of Dr. Leslie Meyer's original vision. He recognized that every child, regardless of his or her medical challenges, could benefit from quality education and therapy services.
