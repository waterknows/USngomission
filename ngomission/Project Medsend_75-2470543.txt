Project MedSend offers student loan repayment grants to healthcare professionals who are headed for career medical missions service under the authority of a recognized missions sending agency -- a MedSend Associate. We also develop funding to repay educational loans for healthcare workers as they minister among the underserved at home and abroad. Project MedSend offers financial counsel to help keep educational borrowing to a minimum. Project MedSend was formed at the request of the missionary members of the House of Delegates of Christian Medical & Dental Associations. Many were having difficulty recruiting replacements and coworkers because of the high cost of health care education.
