The Alliance for Aging Research is the nation's leading citizen advocacy organization for improving the health and independence of Americans as they age. The Alliance was founded in 1986 to promote medical and behavioral research into the aging process. Since then, and as the explosion of the Senior Boom approaches, the Alliance has become the voice for Baby Boomer health by developing, implementing and advocating programs in research, professional and consumer health education and public policy. Since the Alliance was formed, federal support for aging research has more than tripled, private research and development in aging-related health has reached an all time high, and new discoveries are making a lasting difference to the lives of millions of Americans.
