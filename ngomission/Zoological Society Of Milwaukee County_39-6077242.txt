The mission of the Zoological Society of Milwaukee (ZSM), established in 1910, is to take part in conserving wildlife and endangered species, to educate people about the importance of wildlife and the environment, and to support the Milwaukee County Zoo. Helping the Milwaukee County Zoo maintain its reputation as Wisconsin's premier educational and cultural treasure is a big part of the Zoological Society's mission. Together, the Zoo and ZSM serve more than 1.3 million Zoo visitors a year. The ZSM and Zoo work together to attract both a strong family base as well as a diverse, non-traditional audience through free days, targeted school programs, evening concerts, special events and other efforts.
