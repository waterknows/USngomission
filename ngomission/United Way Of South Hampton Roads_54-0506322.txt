Since 1923, the United Way of South Hampton Roads has been a local organization that has focused on the issues that face our community. We serve the citizens of Chesapeake, Isle of Wight, Norfolk, Portsmouth, Suffolk and Virginia Beach. Your United Way uses highly trained volunteers and staff to bring individuals, groups and organizations together in a community-wide effort to improve the quality of life for everyone in South Hampton Roads. The areas for advancement we are focused on are: helping children and youth achieve their potential, promoting financial stability and independence, improving the health of children and adults, and encouraging individual and corporate participation.
