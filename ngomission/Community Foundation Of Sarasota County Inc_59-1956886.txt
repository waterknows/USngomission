The Community Foundation of Sarasota County was created to encourage philanthropic individuals to leave a charitable legacy to the citizens of Sarasota County. Since 1979, the Community Foundation has been making the important connection between individuals' personal memories, passions, and dreams and the fulfillment of their charitable goals. We help create permanent charitable funds of everlasting impact. These funds ensure that people of vision will have an enduring influence on the life of their community and the charitable causes they hold dear. The Community Foundation's mission is to provide stewardship to our communities, enabling caring people and organizations to increase their ability to serve.
