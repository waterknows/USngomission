Family & Children's Place has supported Louisville area families for more than 130 years. Initially, we provided coal to keep homes warm, food to keep children fed and a facility to shelter families who had none. Over time we evolved to work with families with other needs - helping children and families survive and recover from trauma. Family & Children's Place is the leading agency in Greater Louisville and Southern Indiana providing services and treatment that stop and prevent the trauma of abuse, violence and neglect, and provide healing and recovery to promote safe, healthy and stable families.
