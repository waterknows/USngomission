The West Side Catholic Center (WSCC) is a unique organization, financially independent of the Cleveland Diocese and Catholic Charities. Since 1977, our programs - shelter, clothing, meals, outreach, youth advocacy, case management, street survival services and providing rapid rehousing and emergency shelter - have responded to the needs of men, women, and children in the greater Cleveland area, regardless of a client's religious affiliation. All services are provided free of charge, with the assistance of over 400 volunteers.
