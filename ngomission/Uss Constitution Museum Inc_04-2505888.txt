Founded in 1972 and opened in 1976, the USS Constitution Museum ensures that the stories of USS Constitution and those who shaped her history are never forgotten, always remain relevant, and inspire as many people as possible. The Museum serves as the memory and educational voice of USS Constitution, by collecting, preserving, and interpreting the stories of "Old Ironsides" and the people associated with her. We seek to create a positive, memorable experience for both children and adults by inspiring within them a love for the freedom that Constitution symbolizes. We will share Constitution's contributions with a global audience, and we will strive to be the best museum possible based on scholarship and innovative ways of sharing Constitution's stories.
