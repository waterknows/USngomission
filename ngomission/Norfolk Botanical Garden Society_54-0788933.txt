Founded in 1938 as the Azalea Garden project, the Norfolk Botanical Garden's mission is to enrich life by promoting the enjoyment of plants and the environment through beautiful gardens and educational programs. More than twenty thousand children and adults are reached every year at the Garden by programs, classes and Norfolk Botanical Garden lectures. Today, the Garden includes 155 acres, with over 30 theme gardens that can be viewed by tram, boat or by foot. Theme gardens include the Bristow Butterfly Garden, the Sarah Lee Baker Perennial Garden, the Virginia Native Plant Garden and the Bicentennial Rose Garden. Each of these gardens allows guests to see a variety of plants-from the cultivated to the wild.
