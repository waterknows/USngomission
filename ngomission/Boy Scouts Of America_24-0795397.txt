The Susquehanna Council, BSA serves more than 2500 youth through the adult leadership of 1200 adult volunteers. Scouting provides programs to youth in 5 counties in Central Pennsylvania - Snyder, Northumberland, Clinton, Union and Lycoming. The Susquehanna Council is home to beautiful Camp Karoodinha along Penns Creek in western Union County. Six weeks each summer we provide exceptional programming to cub scouts, boy scouts and venturers. We are building character in the youth of our communities, one boy at a time!
