Christian Center Of Park City (CCPC) is a Christian humanitarian, community-focused resource center that helps improve the lives of people and communities through meeting immediate and basic needs, serving as a leading networker of community resources, offering counseling services and spiritual care support, championing advocacy for those in need and most of all by giving hope. The focus area of the Center is primarily on the population centers of Summit and Wasatch counties. We require no membership, dues, or compliance with our faith traditions to be served by our programs and resources. While not a church, we partner with area churches, interfaith councils, secular agencies and individuals to demonstrate God's love in tangible ways.
