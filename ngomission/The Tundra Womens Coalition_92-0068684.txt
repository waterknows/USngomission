The Tundra Women's Coalition (TWC) is committed to promoting a healthy social environment for the women, children and men of the Y-KDelta. We recognized that only with the achievement of full equality for women will families and communities become healthy positive entities. Toward this goal, TWC pledges to promote activities that encourage self-reliance, a sense of personal self-worth and dignity, and which enable women to achieve their fullest potential; knowing that this will result in the betterment of all people. Tundra Women's Coalition currently includes a 17 bed shelter, administrative offices, a Legal Advocacy program, a Community Education Program with a village outreach component, a program for Teens Acting Against Violence and a Childrens Program.
