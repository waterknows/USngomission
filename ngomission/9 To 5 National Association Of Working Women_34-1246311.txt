9to5 National Association of Working Women works to build a movement for economic justice, by engaging directly affected women to improve working conditions. Founded in 1973, 9to5 is now one of the largest national membership organizations of working women in the U.S., dedicated to putting working women's issues on the public agenda. Over the years, 9to5 has helped raise the expectations of low-wage women, who thought that change was out of their reach. Winning justice for working women, 9to5 fights for paid sick days, equal pay, family-supporting jobs with decent wages, and a strong safety net. We lift up the voices of women in low-wage jobs, build their leadership and empower them to bring about real change.
