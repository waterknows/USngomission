The GreenLight Fund “greenlights” powerful programs that can help solve critical local needs, speeding their entry into the new location and giving them a strong start in the local community. With the help of a Selection Advisory Council, the GreenLight Fund identifies urgent needs in the local community and vets potential organizations based on their ability to meet these needs and build on the landscape of organizations already working in the community. Once an organization is “greenlighted” for the local community, the GreenLight Fund partners with the organization to build a strong local organizational foundation and launch the program as quickly as possible. The GreenLight Fund provides critical support during the first four-six years of a program's life in the new community. GreenLight is an on-the-ground partner invested in the early and long-term success of the organization.
