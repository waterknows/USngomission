The Dalit Freedom Network is a human rights, non-government organization that partners with the Dalit people in India in their quest for freedom, justice, and human dignity by mobilizing human, intellectual, and financial resources.  

We represent a vast network of justice-minded, modern-day abolitionists committed to freedom for India's "untouchables." We believe we can end Dalit injustices, such as human trafficking and child labor, and make slavery history in India.
