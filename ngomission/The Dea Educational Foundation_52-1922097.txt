Established in 2001, the DEA Educational Foundation supports the DEA Museum through fundraising, advocacy and educational outreach, exhibit sponsorship, and educational program development. The DEA Educational Foundation allows the Museum to develop and implement engaging state of the art exhibits, displays, interactive stations and educational outreach programs on the many facets of licit and illicit drug problems in this country. In addition to the traveling exhibits, the Foundation is very proud to fund the DEA Youth Dance Program (DEA YDP). The DEA YDP is a free afterschool alternative to drugs through the fun, healthy, and expressive art form of dance.
