Founded in 1965, the Presbyterian Lay Committee (PLC) works to inform and equip Christians to share the biblical faith by proclaiming Jesus Christ alone as: the way of salvation; the truth of God's word; the life of discipleship. The PLC works within the Church for the following: to provide reliable information and resources concerning significant issues confronting the Presbyterian Church; to put greater emphasis on the teaching of the bible as the authoritative word of God; presenting Jesus Christ as the Lord and Savior; and to inform and equip individual Christians to engage the ethical and moral issues in cultural, economic and political affairs as Christ's active disciples.
