The Leadership Institute works to increase the number and effectiveness of conservative public policy leaders. Founded by Morton C. Blackwell in 1979, the Institute identifies, recruits, trains and places conservatives in government, politics, and the media. The Institute teaches conservatives the nuts and bolts of how to succeed in the public policy process. The Institute strives to produce a new generation of public policy leaders unwavering in their commitment to free enterprise, limited government, strong national defense, and traditional values. Institute graduates are equipped with practical skills and professional training to implement sound principles through effective public policy.
