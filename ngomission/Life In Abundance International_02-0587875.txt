Life in Abundance (LIA) exists to mobilize the local Church and restore health, renew hope and inspire lasting transformation for Africa's most vulnerable families. Our transformational development model utilizes an integrated approach that cultivates local leadership through the Church and requires the participation and ownership from the community itself. LIA approaches each community with a long-term vision - one that will enable church partners to meet the urgent needs of a community, but will also empower the community for the future.
