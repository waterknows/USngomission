I Know I Can gives every qualified Columbus Public School District graduate the opportunity to go to college. The program was founded in 1988 on the belief that every child who wishes to pursue higher education should have the opportunity to do so and should not be denied that right because of his or her economic status. We believe that by removing the motivational, informational and financial roadblocks to success, we can help level the educational playing field for Columbus city students and graduates. We motivate students to stay in school and pursue college, advise students and parents how to apply to college and access financial aid, fund students with Last Dollar Grant and leverage additional financial assistance, and support students once in college to help ensure completion.
