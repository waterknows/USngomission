United Methodist Open Door provides for basic human needs, promotes positive life changes, restores hope and protects dignity. United Methodist Open Door began in 1965 as United Methodist Urban Ministry of Wichita by a group of Methodist clergy and laity who sought to respond to the issues of poverty, including issues of racial justice, raised by the turmoil of that time. Today, Open Door serves approximately 38,210 unduplicated people each year through six programs located at three sites: Community Food Ministry, Commodity Supplemental Food Program, Klothes Kloset, Homeless Resource Center, Vision Quest homeless prevention program, and the Transitional Housing Program.
