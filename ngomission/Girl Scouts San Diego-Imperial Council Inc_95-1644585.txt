Founded in 1912, Girl Scouts USA is the world's premiere leadership organization for girls. It provides an accepting, nurturing environment where girls can develop leadership skills, cultivate lifelong friendships, serve their communities and grow through new and exciting experiences. The area's first Girl Scout troop was founded in Coronado in 1917. Now Girl Scouts San Diego provides activities and events for 31,000 girl and nearly 13,000 adult members, trains volunteers, and maintains seven camps and program facilities.
