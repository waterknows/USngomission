St. Petersburg Free Clinic, Inc. is a multi-service, independent not-for-profit human services agency. Founded in 1970, St. Petersburg Free Clinic began as a single walk-in medical facility that provided basic health care services to those without health insurance and those without the means to provide adequate health care for themselves and their families - primarily those who fall through the cracks of existing systems and services. In subsequent years, as additional needs of the community have been identified, we have expanded our services, becoming a multi-service, multi-site agency to address the need for food, shelter and health care through our eight essential programs: Health Center, Dental Clinic, Food Bank, We Help Services, Community Kitchen, Beacon House (homeless men's shelter), Women's Residence (homeless women's shelter) and Family Residence (homeless shelter).
