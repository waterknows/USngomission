Founded in 1974, The mission of The Women's Center is to improve significantly the psychological, career, financial and legal well being of women and families regardless of their ability to pay. Our clinical staff includes over 100 therapists and career counselors who provide more than 37,000 hours of counseling each year. For more than 30 years, we have grown along with the community we serve. Initially, the Center's services focused mainly on career counseling and seminars. However, as social change continued to impact all aspects of women's lives and our community as a whole, the Center developed and expanded its services to meet those challenges. The Center has developed into a counseling & resource Center for women's and families' financial, career, legal and psychological needs.
