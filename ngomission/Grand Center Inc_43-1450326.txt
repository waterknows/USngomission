Grand Center was formed to promote and foster the performing arts in the St. Louis area. With 12,000 theatre seats within four blocks, 12 galleries and museums and over 1,500 cultural events with 1.3 million visitors each year, Grand Center is unique in the country. We are the center of all that feeds the mind, body and soul. From the traditional to the experimental, from around the corner and around the world, we bring the finest in art, music and theatre to the people of St. Louis, the Midwest and the nation. We are a playground for the senses, full of exotic sights, amazing sounds, tantalizing smells and tastes, and overwhelming feelings.
