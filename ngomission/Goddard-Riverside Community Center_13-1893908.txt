Goddard Riverside Community Center is one of New York City's leading human service organizations. We work to meet people's basic needs - food, shelter, education - and to bring them together for mutual aid, social action, and to celebrate our richness as a society. Through 27 programs at 21 sites on the Upper West Side and in West Harlem, we engage people of all ages and backgrounds. Our program areas include: children, youth and families; homeless people; older adults; and advocacy and tenant assistance. We also develop and manage affordable housing, and organize a range of community arts and events. Goddard Riverside was formed in 1959 when two historic settlement houses merged: Riverside Community House and Goddard Neighborhood Center.
