FOCUS is the Fellowship of Christians in Universities and Schools, Inc. It is a diverse community of students, alumni, parents, faculty, clergy, and professionals from a variety of Christian denominations drawn together by a common faith and purpose. Our purpose is to explore with independent school students a life of faith that is real, adventurous, intellectually sound, and eminently practical.
