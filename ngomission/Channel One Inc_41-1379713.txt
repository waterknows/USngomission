Channel One Regional Food Bank helps feed people in need through an efficient system of collection and distribution of food and non-food items to non-profit organizations that serve low-income people. Channel One Regional Food Bank takes in millions of pounds of surplus food from the food industry. That food is then distributed through our network of member agencies, including food shelves, soup kitchens, group homes and shelters. This past year, the Channel One obtained 4.8 million pounds of food and distributed 4.6 million pounds through the hunger relief network that serves a 14 county service area in Southeast Minnesota and Western Wisconsin. Channel One is certified member of Feeding America, The Nation's Food Bank Network.
