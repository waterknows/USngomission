Serving 36,000 youth and volunteers throughout 64 counties in Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois and Tennessee, the Lincoln Heritage Council, Boy Scouts of America, works to foster the character development, worldwide citizenship, and the moral, mental and physical fitness of young people. We offer traditional programs, such as Cub Scout packs, Boy Scout troops and Venture crews, and innovative outreach programs that serve youth with disabilities and urban youth. The council prepares young people to be Prepared. For Life. and to make lifelong ethical choices by instilling the values found in the Scout Oath and Law.
