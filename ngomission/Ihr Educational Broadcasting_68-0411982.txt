Immaculate Heart Radio is a lay apostolate dedicated to spreading the knowledge, love and practice of the Roman Catholic Faith by means of radio. Our programming content is therefore primarily catechetical, devotional, and inspirational.Immaculate Heart Radio exists in response to the call of the Second Vatican Council to the laity to evangelize, and to its call for all members of the Church to use radio to evangelize. Immaculate Heart Radio offers its work in the worldwide effort to fulfill the call of Pope John Paul II for a New Evangelization and a New Springtime for the Church.Immaculate Heart Radio declares an absolute faithfulness to the Holy Father and the Bishops in union with him. We are bound to accurately and fully transmit the Faith as proposed by the Teaching Authority of the Church. We are specifically bound by the vehicle in which it is proposed for our time, the Catechism of the Catholic Church. We hold everything we broadcast up to the Catechism as its standard. These qualities shape our service to the faithful in the several dioceses in which we broadcast, our obedience to the bishops of those dioceses, and our assistance to local priests and religious.Immaculate Heart Radio is committed to Sharing the Heart of the Christian Faith in humility, charity, respect and ecumenism; and to draw upon the vast diversity of riches which is the Catholic heritage in order to broadcast something for every believer.
