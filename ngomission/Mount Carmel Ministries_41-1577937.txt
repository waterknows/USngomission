Mount Carmel Ministries purpose is to transform lives through "Jesus Only". We are blessed to be able to extend the gifts and joy or our beautiful camp as the setting for most of the work we do. Visitors and members of our faith community can use our grounds to get away from their normal routine to celebrate the life we are given in this beautiful setting. Mount Carmel Ministries is a Christian family camp and conference center on the northwest shore of beautiful Lake Carlos, near Alexandria, Minnesota.
