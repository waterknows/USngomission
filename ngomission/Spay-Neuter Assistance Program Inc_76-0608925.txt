SNAP (Spay-Neuter Assistance Program) works to prevent the suffering and death of cats and dogs due to overpopulation, especially in low-income areas. SNAP provides free and reduced-cost sterilization for animals through regular clinic programs and specially funded projects throughout Texas. Our vision is to create a world where there are no homeless dogs and cats.
