Formed in 1953, Keep America Beautiful (KAB) engages individuals to take greater responsibility for improving their community environments. KAB is guided by the principles of education, individual responsibility, public-private partnerships, and volunteer action. It combines education with hands-on stewardship to make America's communities cleaner, greener, safer, and more livable. KAB's work on the ground is carried out by a national network of over 1,000 certified affiliates and participating organizations. Each of these organizations address local challenges by engaging and inspiring community stewardship in three focus areas - litter prevention, waste reduction and beautification.
