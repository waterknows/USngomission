Through a holistic combination of academic support, leadership and career development, and enrichment activities, SAYA! seeks to improve youth's chances to graduate high school, go to college, and become future community leaders. SAYA! youth receive one-on-one tutoring and college advisement, take SAT prep classes and go on campus visits to different public and private colleges. Youth also receive help with completing college applications, personal statements, financial aid forms and scholarship applications. SAYA! provides leadership programs for young women and men through which they explore self-identity, personal relationships, gender discrimination, and cultural pressures of growing up in the United States. Through guest speakers, trips to diverse workplaces and an annual fair, youth also gain exposure to different career paths.
