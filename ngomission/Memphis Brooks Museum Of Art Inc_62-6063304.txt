Founded in 1989, the Memphis Brooks Museum of Art is one of the largest art museums in the American South and houses an outstanding collection of art dating from antiquity to the present. The Brooks is dedicated to enriching the lives of our visitors through the museum's expanding collection, varied exhibitions, and dynamic programs. The museum provides visitors the opportunity to learn about the visual arts through diverse traveling exhibitions and thought-provoking in-house exhibitions. Nearly 20,000 children participate in free school tours that include hands-on art activities, which enable students to make crucial connections between what they see and what they create.
