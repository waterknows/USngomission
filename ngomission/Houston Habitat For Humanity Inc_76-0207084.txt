Houston Habitat for Humanity, founded in 1987, is a Christian-based housing ministry. Embracing all faiths, the organization is dedicated to eliminating substandard housing in our community by helping low-income families purchase a simple, decent home in which to live. To date, Houston Habitat has built over 1,000 affordable homes and served more than 4,200 people - half of whom are children. For two decades, Houston Habitat has worked to eliminate substandard housing by helping our neighbors purchase simple, decent homes in which to live.
