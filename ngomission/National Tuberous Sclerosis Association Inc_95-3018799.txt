The Tuberous Sclerosis Alliance (TS Alliance) was founded in 1974 by four mothers coming together to provide fellowship, generate awareness, pursue more knowledge and provide hope to those who share the common bond of facing the daily challenges of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). During its more than 30 years of existence and growth, the TS Alliance has expanded its mission to improve the quality of life for individuals and families affected by TSC through the stimulation and sponsorship of research, the development of programs, support services and resource information, and the development and implementation of public and professional education programs designed to heighten awareness of TSC. TSC is a genetic disorder that causes tumors to form in many different organs, primarily in the brain, eyes, heart, kidney, skin and lungs.
