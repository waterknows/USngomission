The mission of the United Way of Gloucester County is to be the leader in building community capacity to foster individual well being. Through collaboration with the United Way, consumers and providers of health and human services in Gloucester County will be more self-sufficient. United Way of Gloucester County was established in 1957. Since that time, local United Way campaigns have stimulated more than $77 million in charitable giving by county residents. It is the largest and most successful fund raising organization in Gloucester County. United Way supports 35 programs offered by our 27 partner agencies. When resources are available, United Way also provides funds to stimulate innovative solutions to community problems and seeks additional agency members.
