Equine Advocates mission is to rescue, protect and prevent the abuse of horses through education, investigation, rescue operations, the dissemination of information to the public and the operation of a horse sanctuary for slaughter-bound, abused and neglected equines. Since our founding in 1996, Equine Advocates has rescued countless horses, ponies, donkeys and mules. Our Humane Education Programs are continually expanding. We offer tours and present lectures and classes on a variety of equine-related subjects. We organize and host the annual American Equine Summit where experts from across the country come to the sanctuary to speak on urgent issues facing America's wild and domestic horses. All presentations are recorded and available for viewing on our website. We have also conducted symposiums on Equine Cruelty for law enforcement where experts discussed how to recognize abuse/neglect cases and how to effectively enforce the cruelty laws.
