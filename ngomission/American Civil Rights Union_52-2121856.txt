Founded in 1998, the American Civil Rights Union works to protect the civil rights of all Americans, by publicly advancing a Constitutional understanding of civil rights; monitoring judicial nominees, judges, and legal organizations, while resisting those that threaten civil rights; and filing amicus briefs in critical civil rights court cases. Believing that the U.S. Constitution, including the Bill of Rights, is the greatest legal document ever written, the ACRU stands against harmful anti-Constitutional ideologies that have taken hold in our nation's courts, law schools, and bureaucracies. While others promote entitlements and license in the name of "liberties," the ACRU defends the civil rights set forth at the American Founding.
