The George Washington University was created in 1821 through an Act of the Congress, fulfilling George Washington's vision of an institution in the nation's capital dedicated to educating and preparing future leaders. Today, GW is the largest institution of higher education in the District of Columbia. We have more than 20,000 students - from all 50 states, the District and more than 130 countries - studying a rich range of disciplines: from forensic science and creative writing to international affairs and computer engineering, as well as medicine, public health, the law and public policy. GW comprises three campuses - Foggy Bottom and Mount Vernon in Washington, D.C., and Ashburn, VA. - as well as several graduate education centers in the metropolitan area and Hampton Roads, VA.
