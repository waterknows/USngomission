The Garden Conservancy is a national organization founded in 1989 to preserve exceptional American gardens for the public's education and enjoyment. As the first national organization devoted to garden preservation, the Garden Conservancy is working to stem that tide by identifying gardens of unusual merit across the nation - from a desert garden in California to a Japanese garden in New York - and working with their owners and other interested parties to ensure the gardens' futures. The Garden Conservancy works in partnership with individual garden owners and public and private organizations, and uses its legal, financial, and horticultural resources to secure each garden's future and to make it permanently accessible to the public.
