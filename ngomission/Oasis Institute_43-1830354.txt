The OASIS Institute, founded in 1982, is a national 501(c)(3) organization that promotes healthy aging by providing lifelong learning, health programs, and volunteer service opportunities. Through it's programs, OASIS puts into practice the finding of the landmark MacArthur Foundation study of Aging in America. Researchers Rowe and Kahn found that the key ingredients for a high quality of life are maintaining a low risk for disease, a high level of engagement with the community and high physical and cognitive function, and "it is the combination of all three that represents the concept of successful aging fully."Today, OASIS programs are offered in 55 cities.
