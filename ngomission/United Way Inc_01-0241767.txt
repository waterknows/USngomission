Founded in 1929, United Way of Greater Portland's mission is to improve people's lives by mobilizing the caring power of our communities. We continue to ensure quality essential services, like affordable childcare, mental health counseling and elder care, and we also bring people together to help identify growing community needs and work toward innovative solutions with measurable results. We are working to advance the common good by focusing on programs supporting education, income and health - the building blocks of a strong community.
