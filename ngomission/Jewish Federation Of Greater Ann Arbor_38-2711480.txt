The Jewish Federation of Greater Ann Arbor provides support for charitable, religious, and educational organizations. Our central community institution coordinates community-wide planning and raises nearly $2 million annually to care for Jews overseas and to support more than a dozen local Jewish agencies and programs. Funds are allocated annually, based upon an analysis of the local and global needs of the Jewish people. In 2008, 56% was allocated to local Jewish institutions, and 44% was distributed to non-local causes (including overseas).
