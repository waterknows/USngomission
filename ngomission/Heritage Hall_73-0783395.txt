Established in 1969, Heritage Hall is a college preparatory school with high academic standards. It is our mission to inspire in our students the curiosity to learn, the self-confidence to lead, and the compassion to serve. The school's motto - To learn, to lead, to serve - is embedded in this statement of mission and guides us through our daily affairs. Our goal is to challenge each student to prepare for living in an increasingly complex and global society. While our students graduate with extensive knowledge in multiple disciplines, we teach them a readiness to question, evaluate, and reach new understandings. Our traditional curriculum, infused with critical-thinking and problem-solving skills, develop abilities that lead to lifelong success.
