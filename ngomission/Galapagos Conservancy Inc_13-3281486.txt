Formed in 1986, the Galapagos Conservancy (GC) has its roots in two organizations that merged in 2002: the Darwin Scientific Foundation, an organization which managed an endowment for research in Galapagos, and Charles Darwin Foundation, Inc., an organization dedicated to raising funds and awareness for Galapagos conservation. GC is dedicated exclusively to the long-term protection of the Galapagos Islands. This single focus allows us to maximize the impact of the financial investments of our members, who include individuals and institutions that care deeply about the Galapagos Islands and understand the scientific importance of preserving this extraordinary ecosystem. We advocate through programs of constituency building, education, and fundraising in North America.
