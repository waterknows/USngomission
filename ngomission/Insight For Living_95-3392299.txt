Insight for Living, the Bible-teaching radio ministry of Chuck Swindoll, is committed to excellence in communicating the truths of Scripture and the person of Jesus Christ in an accurate, clear, and practical manner. Our desire is for people to grow in their understanding of God's plan for their lives and also to mature as authentic Christians. In the 21st century, technology has opened up media channels such as the Internet and brought about broader AM and FM availability for many countries. Insight for Living is currently broadcasting, podcasting, and Web streaming in seven of the world's top ten languages. Along with our 30 minute daily broadcast, Insight for Living also supports listeners in their personal and spiritual growth through Christian resources.
