Habitat for Humanity of Greater Los Angeles works in partnership with God, the community, and people in need by building and renovating homes to make affordable home ownership a matter of conscience and action. The service area of Habitat for Humanity of Greater Los Angeles encompasses a nearly 900 square-mile roughly bounded by the Ventura County line on the west, Mullholland Drive, Interstates 101 and 60 on the north, San Pedro and the Pacific Ocean beyond on the south, and the Orange county line on the east. Since 1990, we have built and rehabilitated over 900 homes locally and internationally. Habitat for Humanity is an ecumenical Christian organization that does not identify with any one church or denomination.
