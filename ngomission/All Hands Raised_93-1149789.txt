All Hands Raised serves as the backbone organization for the All Hands Raised Partnership. In all that we do our focus is on supporting education, equity and excellence from cradle to career. The roots of this were planted when we were established nearly two decades ago as the Portland Public Schools Foundation. We synchronize the community to help partners from all sectors of Multnomah County work in concert to ensure our kids' success from birth to career and we steward PPS parent-led fundraising and manage the PPS Equity Fund Grants. Through it all, we are steadfast in our commitment to help all kids achieve their full potential.
