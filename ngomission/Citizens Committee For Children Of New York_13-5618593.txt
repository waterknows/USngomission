Since 1944, Citizens' Committee for Children of New York, Inc. (CCC) has convened, informed and mobilized New Yorkers to make the city a better place for children. CCC's approach to child advocacy is fact-based and combines the best features of public policy advocacy with a tradition of citizen activism. Casting light on the issues, engaging allies, fueling civic discourse, identifying improvements and envisioning alternatives has helped CCC make children a priority in New York City. CCC provides a voice for children, especially poor and vulnerable children and children with special needs. We champion children who cannot vote, lobby or advocate on their own behalf to secure the rights, protections and services they deserve.
