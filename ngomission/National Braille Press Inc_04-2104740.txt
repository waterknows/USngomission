National Braille Press (NBP) is a Boston-based braille printing and publishing house founded in 1927. The guiding purposes of NBP are to promote the literacy of blind children through braille, and to provide access to information that empowers blind people to actively engage in work, family, and community affairs. Last year NBP pressed 15 million braille pages using special translation software and computer-driven equipment. NBP offers braille books, magazines, textbooks, tests, and embossing services.
