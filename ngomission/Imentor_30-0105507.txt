iMentor's mission is to improve the lives of young people from underserved communities through innovative, technology-based approaches to mentoring. Over the past ten years, iMentor has transformed over 20,000 lives. iMentor cultivates relationships between young people and volunteer adult mentors through an innovative combination of e-mail correspondence and in-person meetings. To-date, iMentor has matched over 10,000 mentor-mentee pairs, partnering with 30 NYC schools and after school programs in four of New York City's five boroughs and programs all over the country through iMentor Interactive. iMentor's vision is that one day, all youth will be connected to adult role models who motivate and guide them through high school and college graduation.
