Communities in Schools of Richmond (CIS) helps kids stay in school by identifying and addressing the unmet needs of children and families. In partnership with Richmond Public Schools and Henrico County Public Schools, CIS identifies the most critical needs of students K-12 and their families and locates and coordinates community resources, dedicated volunteers and agencies to serve in partnership with the schools. CIS ensures that the work of these outside agencies and volunteers is interconnected and integrated, providing the support students need the most.
