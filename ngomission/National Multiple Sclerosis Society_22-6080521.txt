On October 1st, 2008, the Mid Jersey and Greater North Jersey Chapters of the National MS Society became one. This merger resulted in the creation of the National Multiple Sclerosis, New Jersey Metro Chapter. National Multiple Sclerosis Society, New Jersey Metro Chapter's mission is to end the devastating effects of multiple sclerosis. We offer a wide range of programs to help you and your family cope with the everyday demands of living with MS. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society funds more MS research, offers more services for people with MS, and provides more professional education programs than any other MS organization in the world. Since its founding in 1946, over $420 million has been invested in research to find the cause, treatments, and cure for MS.
