The John Ankerberg Show is a weekly half-hour internationally syndicated television program whose purpose is to demonstrate that Christianity is true so that our viewers will embrace it for themselves and learn to share it effectively with others. The formats of choice for this apologetics ministry are informal debates between representatives of differing belief systems, and documentary-styled presentations on major issues in society to which the historic Christian faith has something of consequence to say. The programs are designed to reach and appeal to a thinking audience of Christians and non-Christians alike.
