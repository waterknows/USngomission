The Lymphoma Research Foundation (LRF) is the nation's largest lymphoma-focused voluntary health organization devoted exclusively to funding lymphoma research and providing people with lymphoma and healthcare professionals with up-to-date education about this type of cancer. The LRF mission is to eradicate lymphoma and serve those touched by the disease. The Foundation invests millions of dollars every year to combat lymphoma and assist those whose lives have been affected by a lymphoma diagnosis. LRF is dedicated to identifying a cure through an aggressively-funded research program and to helping members of the lymphoma community by providing comprehensive, disease-specific programs and services. LRF was formed in November 2001 by the merger of the Cure for Lymphoma Foundation (CFL) and the Lymphoma Research Foundation of America (LRFA)
