The Multiple Sclerosis Foundation (MSF) was established in 1986. As a predominantly service-based organization, MSF provides a comprehensive approach to helping people with MS maintain both their health and well-being. 



We offer nationally accessible programming and support to keep them self-sufficient and their homes safe, while our educational programs heighten public awareness and promote understanding about the illness. Individuals affected by MS, regional support groups, and healthcare professionals rely on our resources. 



Our priority is to serve with empathy, resourcefulness, and responsibility. We are here to listen, assist, and empower. All programs are centrally coordinated from our national headquarters in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. 



There are no fees or fundraising participation requirements in order to either receive assistance or publication subscriptions.
