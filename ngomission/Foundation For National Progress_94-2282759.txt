Established in 1976, the Foundation for National Progress (FNP) exists to publish and support Mother Jones magazine. Mother Jones is a news organization that specializes in investigative, political, and social justice reporting. We currently have two main channels: an award-winning bimonthly national magazine (circulation 240,000), and a website featuring new, original reporting. The foundation also supports the leading independent hands-on training program for emerging journalists, the Ben Bagdikian Fellowship Program. In 1993 Mother Jones became the first general interest magazine to go online.
