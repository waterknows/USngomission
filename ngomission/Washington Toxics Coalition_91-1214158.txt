Founded in 1981, Washington Toxics Coalition (WTC) protects public health and the environment by eliminating toxic pollution. WTC promotes alternatives, advocates policies, empowers communities, and educates people to create a healthy environment. We believe that all people and other species have the right to a healthy environment, free from pollution. We believe in the right to know about toxic chemicals used, released, or disposed of in communities. We advocate precedent-setting policies based on the precautionary principle and pollution prevention. Our positions are developed from a careful review of science and grounded in public policy that promotes a toxic free environment.
