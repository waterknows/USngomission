The purpose of the Boy Scouts of America--incorporated on February 8, 1910, and chartered by Congress in 1916--is to provide an educational program for boys and young adults to build character, to train in the responsibilities of participating citizenship, and to develop personal fitness. The Coronado Area Council continues its proud heritage of serving community organizations across the 32 counties that comprise our service area. More than 3,700 youth participate in the Scouting and Exploring programs provided by nearly 1,500 dedicated volunteer leaders.
