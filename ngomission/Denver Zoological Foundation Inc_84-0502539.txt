In 1896, a small, orphaned black bear named Billy Bryan became the first resident of Denver Zoo. Today, Denver Zoo is home to nearly 4,000 animals representing over 700 species including the incredibly rare okapi, red-bellied lemur, Amur leopard, and Siberian tiger. The Denver Zoo's mission is to: provide a wildlife conservancy which offers high-quality experiences in an urban recreational setting; provide environmental education which inspires public awareness of global conservation; and engage in scientific programs which make meaningful contributions to the conservation of animals and their ecosystems.
