The New York State Sheriffs Association Institute was formed in 1979 to operate some of the charitable and educational programs formerly conducted by the Sheriffs Association. The specific goals of the Institute are: to provide education and training for Sheriffs and their staff; to educate member Sheriffs, their staff members and members of the general public in all the areas of Sheriffs duties, all so that the public might be well served by the Sheriffs of New York State; to operate the Institute's Summer Camp for children; to operate the Sheriffs' Victim Hotline (VINE) program; and to operate the Sheriffs Scholarship Program for community college criminal justice students.
