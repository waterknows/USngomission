Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT)'s mission is to conceptualize and implement public policies that will keep the Internet open, innovative, and free. These include preserving the unique nature of the internet, enhancing freedom of expression, protecting privacy, and limiting government surveillance. When the Internet was in its infancy, CDT shaped the first legislative choices and court decisions that allowed this technology of freedom to flourish. Today, we are committed to finding innovative, practical and balanced solutions to the tough policy challenges facing this rapidly evolving medium.
