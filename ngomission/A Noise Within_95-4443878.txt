A Noise Within's mission is to produce the great works of world drama in rotating repertory with a company of professional, classically-trained actors and to educate the public through outreach and conservatory training programs that foster an understanding and appreciation of history's greatest plays and playwrights. A Noise Within is the only company in Southern California working in the repertory tradition - rotating productions using a resident ensemble of professional, trained artists - and dedicated solely to producing classical dramatic literature.
