The Animal Welfare Society (AWS) is a private humane society formed in the early 1960's. In 1967, AWS became incorporated and has now expanded to a shelter of more than 13,000 square feet, caring for more than 3,300 animals annually. Our service area for adoptions and other services extends throughout Southern Maine. We provide municipal shelter services to 21 communities representing a population of nearly 200,000 persons. AWS, a non-profit organization, exists to provide humane shelter and care to animals temporarily in need of housing, to assist in disaster response and to further the cause of responsible animal adoption and ownership through education and public awareness. The society actively promotes kindness, the elimination of cruelty and neglect to all animals, and the lifelong commitment of people to their pets.
