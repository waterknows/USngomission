Founded in 1995, Science Central was originally incorporated by a group of teachers, parents, engineers, and community/business leaders who wanted to see the creation of a local science discovery center. Science Central became Indiana's first hands-on science center and is now a regional resource that provides inspiring and fun hands-on science education for people of all ages.
