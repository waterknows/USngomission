Open Door Mission is a Gospel Rescue Mission founded in 1954. Each day, Open Door Mission Ministries provides 320 men, women, and children with safe shelter beds, serves more than 1,500 hot nutritious meals, and provides preventive measures to more than 250 families living in poverty. To meet the basic physical needs of the hungry and homeless, the Open Door Mission's Day Facility Services provide free transportation from the downtown area to Open Door Mission and Lydia House. Open Door Mission offers life-changing programs for those recovering from life-altering addictions and abuse to break the cycle of homelessness and poverty.
