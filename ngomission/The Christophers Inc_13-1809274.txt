Founded in 1945, The Christophers encourages people of all ages, and from all walks of life, to use their God-given talents to make a positive difference in the world. We believe that each person has a God-given mission to fulfill, a particular job to do that has been given to no one else. Love and truth come to us through God, but these gifts are not ours to keep. By sharing them with others each of us becomes a Christ-bearer, a Christopher in the most fundamental sense of that word. All are welcome to join us, knowing that in embracing the Christopher mission they will share one overriding commitment: the love of all people for the love of God.
