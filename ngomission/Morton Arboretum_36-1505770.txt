Founded in 1922, The Morton Arboretum collects and studies trees, shrubs, and other plants from around the world, to display them across naturally beautiful landscapes for people to study and enjoy, and to learn how to grow them in ways that enhance our environment. Our goal is to encourage the planting and conservation of trees and other plants for a greener, healthier, and more beautiful world. The Morton Arboretum is an internationally recognized organization dedicated to the planting and conservation of trees. Its 1,700 acres hold collections of more than 4,000 kinds of trees, shrubs, and other plants from around the world. The Arboretum houses the renowned Sterling Morton Library, devoted to the literature and art of botany and horticulture.
