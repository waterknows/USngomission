The Northeast Organic Farming Association of Vermont (NOFA Vermont) is a nonprofit association of farmers, gardeners, and consumers working to promote an economically viable and ecologically sound Vermont food system for the benefit of current and future generations. NOFA Vermont was founded in Putney in 1971, making it one of the oldest organic farming associations in the United States. Today, we are proud to have over 1,300 members throughout the state and to certify over 580 farms and processors to the USDA National Organic Program Standards.
