The Lyric Opera of Chicago, originally known as The Lyric Theatre of Chicago, was founded in 1954 by Carol Fox, Lawrence V. Kelly, and Nicola Rescigno. Its artistic standards are universally admired, and it has consistently offered its patrons a world-class roster of singers, conductors, directors, designers, choreographers, and dancers in a wide-ranging repertoire. More than 274,000 tickets were sold for Lyric Opera of Chicago's 2008-2009 season which included 82 performances of nine operas. The Civic Opera Building is the permanent home of Lyric Opera of Chicago. Its 3,563-seat capacity makes it the second-largest opera auditorium in North America.
