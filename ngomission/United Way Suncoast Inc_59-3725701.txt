United Way Suncoast is dedicated to breaking the cycle of generational poverty in the region. Our strategy is to focus on programs and services to build early literacy, youth success and financial stability for those in need. Why? Because undereducated children in poverty are nearly three times more likely to drop out of high school and repeat the cycle. Celebrating 90 years of historical roots, the United Way has worldwide recognition and the more than 1,200 United Way America offices share the same community-oriented goals. Since 1924, the presence of the United Way in Southwest Florida has been growing and combining into what is now the United Way Suncoast.
