The Hillsborough Education Foundation serves the students, teachers and public schools in Hillsborough County. The Education Foundation has invested more than $80 million in our public schools since 1988. Our objectives are two-fold: We want to make sure that every child and teacher have the critical resources they need to have the best learning experience in our schools, and we want to support the mission of Hillsborough County Public Schools.
