Founded in 1977, Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice is a dynamic global foundation providing critically needed financial support to lesbian-led, LGBTI and progressive organizations. Separated by continents, language and culture, Astraea grantees are seizing opportunities, and laying the groundwork necessary for women and LGBTI people to claim their human rights. Today, Astraea is the only foundation in the world solely dedicated to supporting LGBTI organizations in both the U.S. and internationally. We raise funds and issue grants based on the belief that all women can participate in the philanthropic process - from giving to grantmaking.
