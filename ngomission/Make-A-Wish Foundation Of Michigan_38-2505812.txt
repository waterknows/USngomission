Make-A-Wish Michigan grants the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions to enrich the human experience with hope, strength and joy. Since 1984, Make-A-Wish Michigan has granted wishes to more than 8,000 children. Wishes provide a respite for our wish kids and their families as they bravely face their health challenges. The majority of wishes fall into one of four categories: I wish to go, I wish to have, I wish to be and I wish to meet. Each eligible child must be between the ages of 2 1/2 and 18 years and live in Michigan. All wish requests are considered without regard to gender, race, ethnic origin, financial status, or religious preference.
