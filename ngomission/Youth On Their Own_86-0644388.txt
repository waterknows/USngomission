Youth On Their Own (YOTO) is a dropout prevention program that supports the high school graduation of homeless unaccompanied youth throughout Southern Arizona. The youth we serve are in grades 6-12 (up to age 21) and have been abandoned through no fault of their own. Students are enrolled in Pima County public schools - including charter and alternative schools - and are motivated to obtain their high school diplomas despite personal and financial hardship. YOTO provides these tenacious young people with financial assistance, basic needs, and guidance as they work towards their high school graduation.
