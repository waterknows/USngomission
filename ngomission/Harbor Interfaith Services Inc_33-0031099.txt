Harbor Interfaith Services empowers the homeless and working poor to achieve self-sufficiency by providing support services including shelter, transitional housing, food, job placement, advocacy, childcare, education and life-skills training. Each year, we assist approximately 12,000 people by providing the comprehensive services they need to lift themselves out of poverty and onto the road of self-sufficiency. A majority of those we serve are families.
