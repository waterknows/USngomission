Louisville Ballet, the official ballet of the commonwealth of Kentucky, was founded in March 1952 as a civic ballet company. The Louisville Ballet named Bruce Simpson as the artistic director of the Company and the Louisville Ballet School in spring 2002. Under the direction of Mr. Simpson, the Louisville Ballet continues its philosophy of presenting an eclectic range of exciting work underscored by a foundation rooted in the classical repertoire. Through the dedication of its dancers, staff, school faculty and board of directors, the Company continues to enrich the community. Sharing the art form of dance with the citizens of Kentucky and Southern Indiana is a long-standing tradition of the Louisville Ballet. The Company's educational programs reach over 12,000 schoolchildren annually through student matinee performances and on-site lecture demonstrations.
