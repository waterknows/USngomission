The Ramona Humane Society is dedicated to fostering the humane treatment of all animals. Our goal is to eliminate animal over-population by offering low-cost spay and neutering services, public outreach programs and promoting the adoption of pets to loving homes. The organization's specific accomplishments include an adoption program, low-cost spay/neuter/shots clinic, license purchasing, lost and found services, and micro-chipping services. The organization has also instituted a Senior Pets for Seniors program and provides educational materials to the general public.
