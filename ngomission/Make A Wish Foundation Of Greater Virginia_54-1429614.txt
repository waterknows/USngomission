The Make-A-Wish Foundation of Greater Virginia grants the wishes of children with life-threatening illnesses to enrich the human experience with hope, strength and joy. The Make-A-Wish Foundation of Greater Virginia has been granting wishes in the Commonwealth since August of 1987. Through fund raising and donor support, the Greater Virginia Chapter has been able to grant the wishes of over 3,400 children. Our Chapter territory covers the entire Commonwealth of Virginia except for the counties immediately surrounding Washington, D.C. We grant the wishes of children between the ages of 2 1/2 and 18 who have life-threatening illnesses.
