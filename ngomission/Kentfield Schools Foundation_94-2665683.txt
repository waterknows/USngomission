KIK Kentfield Schools Foundation was created to supplement the District's budget to ensure our kids receive the best possible education regardless of how our schools are funded. As it stands our schools are community funded. The old-fashioned State-pays-for-everything public school has disappeared. This means that parents, family members, business partners and other community members fund the education our children receive at Bacich and Kent. Nearly half of the California school districts have created foundations to provide additional funding for their schools and our district is no exception in this area. In fact, your support and other community members' generosity provides nearly a tenth of our district's budget dollars.
