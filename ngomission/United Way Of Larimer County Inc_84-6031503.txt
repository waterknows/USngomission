United Way of Larimer County with our community partners, donors, and supporters are working toward the long-term solutions in the areas of education, income and health to achieve greater community impact.

 These are the building blocks to a good quality of life: Health: When every person in Larimer County has his or her basic needs met, we create a healthier, more stable community. Income: Enough income provides stability for families and individuals, allowing them to thrive. Education: Entering school ready to learn and finishing high school prepares children to succeed in college, work and life. Our mission is to cultivate and mobilize community resources to change and save lives.
