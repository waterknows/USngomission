The New York Public Interest Research Group Fund supports the New York Public Interest Research Group (NYPIRG) which is New York State's largest student-directed consumer, environmental and government reform organization. NYPIRG is a nonpartisan group established to effect policy reforms while training students and other New Yorkers to be advocates. Since 1973, NYPIRG has played the key role in fighting for more than 120 public interest laws and executive orders. NYPIRG's 21 college campus chapters provide much of NYPIRG's energy, resources, and activism. Each campus chapter consists of full-time staff organizers and a large core of student volunteers. Students at NYPIRG chapters work on projects that both support NYPIRG's statewide agenda and focus on local issues.
