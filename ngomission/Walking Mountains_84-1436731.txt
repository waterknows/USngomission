Walking Mountains Science Center works to awaken a sense of wonder and inspire environmental stewardship and sustainability through natural science education. As a science learning center, we offer hands-on, innovative field science programs for over 3,500 students each school year, summer youth science camps, adult seminars, guided half and full day hikes, and year-round interpretive programs for people of all ages. Residents and visitors can participate in our programs at our main campus in Avon, the Vail Nature Center, and the Nature Discovery Center at the top of Vail Mountain. Previously called the Gore Range Natural Science School when it was founded in 1998, Walking Mountains began as a grassroots effort that has grown year-by-year, bolstered by tremendous support from the community. At Walking Mountains Science Center, we believe that nature is for everyone.
