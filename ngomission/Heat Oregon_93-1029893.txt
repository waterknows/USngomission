HEAT Oregon was founded in 1989 to help low income Oregonians become more energy self-reliant. HEAT Oregon gifts warmth and power to Oregonians facing hardships. HEAT Oregon's primary program objective is to prevent disconnection of utility service during inclement weather by providing bill payment assistance to low income households in emergency situations. HEAT Oregon partners with more than 30 local community and social service organizations throughout the state of Oregon to help deliver energy assistance to qualifying households. Donations made to HEAT Oregon from any county in Oregon provide energy assistance to neighbors within the same county from which they were donated; HEAT Oregon calls it Neighbor Helping Neighbor. Over the years, HEAT Oregon has helped to keep the heat and lights on for tens of thousands of low-income households.
