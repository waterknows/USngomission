Serving since 1919, the Sioux Falls Area Humane Society (SFAHS) is an open admission facility that takes in abandoned, abused, homeless, and unwanted animals that need tender loving care until they can find a permanent home. Our mission is to help these animals find their new permanent home, prevent animal cruelty, and educate people on the humane treatment of animals. The SFAHS takes in over 5,000 animals a year. These animals are mostly dogs and cats as well as rabbits, gerbils, hamsters, guinea pigs, lizards, snakes, and birds.
