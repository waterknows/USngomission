In a Southwestern, college-preparatory environment, The Orme School develops sound character, intellectual growth and curiosity, and an appreciation of our diverse cultural heritage and natural environment. The nurturing of each student's physical, aesthetic, and spiritual life is emphasized through high expectations and a strong sense of personal and community responsibility. Established in 1929, the school is located on a 26,000-acre working ranch in the Arizona high country, an area of immensely striking natural beauty. The school's mission is based upon the values of tradition, excellence, and character. These values are enmeshed in our boarding school and day school programs for grades K-12. We are proud that 100 percent of our graduates are accepted to colleges, universities, or junior colleges.
