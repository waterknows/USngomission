Founded in 1946, Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA) is the only congressionally chartered veterans service organization dedicated solely to serving the needs of veterans with spinal cord injury or spinal cord dysfunction (SCI/D). Paralyzed Veterans has developed a unique expertise on a wide variety of issues involving the special needs of our members - veterans of the armed forces who have experienced SCI/D. PVA uses that expertise to be the leading advocate for: quality health care for our members; research and education addressing SCI/D; benefits available as a result of our members' military service; and civil rights and opportunities which maximize the independence of our members.
