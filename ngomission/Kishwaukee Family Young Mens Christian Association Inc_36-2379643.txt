Founded in 1964, The Kishwaukee Family YMCA works to promote Christian principles through quality services and facilities. We strive to enrich the Spirit, Mind and Body of all of our participants, especially families and children, regardless of ability to pay. Our programs focus on youth development, healthy living, and social responsibility.
