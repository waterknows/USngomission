Camp Courageous of Iowa was founded in 1972 for the sole purpose of establishing a camp for the disabled. Today the camp is open year-round, has over 150 acres of land with 14 buildings, and annually serves nearly 5,000 campers, ranging in age from 1 to 105. Individuals with disabilities, as well as their families, should experience year-round recreational and respite care activities in a camp setting. Camp Courageous of Iowa provides this needed service to all. The camp provides opportunities for social and personal growth within a supportive environment. Campers learn to try a variety of creative and challenging activities and experience success. Campers develop enhanced self-esteem which carries over to work, home, or school environments.
