Since 1976, Casa Teresa has been providing a temporary home and on-going support for pregnant women 18 years of age and older who are alone. Life skills and education programs prepare these women to make loving and informed decisions for themselves and their babies. Casa Teresa has been home to over 5,000 women and children over the past 35 years. They offer high quality training and education programs in the areas of prenatal care and parenting, health and nutrition education tailored to the needs of each resident, all within the security and comfort of a loving and supportive residential setting. Career case management, financial guidance and life skills are stressed, increasing the probability of a successful future for mother and baby.



Our vision is to empower pregnant homeless women 18 years of age and older to achieve life long self sufficiency for themselves and their children.
