In April 1975, Crisis Assistance Ministry officially opened in Dilworth United Methodist Church. The mission of Crisis Assistance Ministry is the same today: to provide assistance and advocacy for people in financial crisis, helping them move toward self-sufficiency. The agency continues to fulfill the vision of its founders by being an efficient, effective way for the community to pool resources and help people who face economic hardship. Our vision is to inspire our community to justice and generosity as we provide help, hope and understanding to people struggling with limited financial resources.
