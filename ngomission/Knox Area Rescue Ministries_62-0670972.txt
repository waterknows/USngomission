Knox Area Rescue Ministries was formally established on December 8, 1960 by five local pastors. Recognizing the necessity for a permanent ministry effort to meet the needs of the growing population of the homeless in Knoxville, these men forged the vision as well as established the first ministry center located in the heart of the downtown area on Fifth Avenue. Today, Knox Area Rescue Ministries is more equipped and prepared than ever before to fulfill its mandate and pledge to the hurting and homeless of the greater Knoxville area. Our mission is to seek to rescue the poor and needy of the Knox Area by providing services in Jesus' name.
