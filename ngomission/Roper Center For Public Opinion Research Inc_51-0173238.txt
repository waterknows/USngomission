Founded in 1947, the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research is a leading educational facility in the field of public opinion. The Center exists to promote the intelligent, responsible and imaginative use of public opinion in addressing the problems faced by Americans and citizens of other nations. In an increasingly complex and interdependent global environment, the Roper Center hopes to foster increased international understanding and to promote cross-national research. Through the maintenance of the world's largest archive of survey data, and through its programs, presentations and advanced research, the Roper Center strives to improve the practice of survey research and the use of survey data in the United States and abroad.
