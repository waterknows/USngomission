Founded in 2001, Free Wheelchair Mission is a faith-based nonprofit dedicated to providing wheelchairs to individuals with physical challenges in the developing world. Headquartered in Irvine, CA, FWM works around the world in partnership with a vast network of humanitarian, faith-based and government organizations, sending wheelchairs to hundreds of thousands of individuals with disabilities who need a wheelchair, but can't afford one. We provide not only the gift of mobility, but of dignity, independence, and hope. Our mission is "to transform lives through the gift of mobility to the physically disabled poor in developing countries as motivated by Jesus Christ." Our vision is to provide 1.2 million wheelchairs by 2017.
