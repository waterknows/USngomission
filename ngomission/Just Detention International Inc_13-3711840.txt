Just Detention International (JDI) is a health and human rights organization that seeks to end sexual abuse in all forms of detention. JDI is concerned about the safety and well-being of all detainees, including those held in adult prisons and jails, juvenile facilities, immigration detention centers, and police lockups, whether run by government agencies or by private corporations on behalf of the government. JDI has three core goals for its work: to hold government officials accountable for prisoner rape; to promote public attitudes that value the health and safety of all people in detention; and to ensure that survivors of this type of abuse get the help they need.
