The ARK is a community-funded social services agency with facilities on Chicago's North Side and in suburban Northbrook. Since 1971, The ARK has provided free social and medical services to help distressed members of the Chicagoland Jewish community return to self-reliance. We recognize that many members of the community - Jews from all walks of life, from all parts of Chicagoland - are deeply in need of help and kindness. We work with each person or family in distress to create a personalized and comprehensive care plan that draws upon The ARK's wide array of free social and medical services: food, rent and utility assistance, legal aid, job search assistance, benefits advocacy, psychological therapy and testing, a day program for adults with mental health needs, transitional housing, medical, dental and eye care, pharmaceutical assistance, and more. Our primary goals are to stabilize our clients' situations and assist them in achieving the highest degree of self-reliance possible. Each year, The ARK cares for approximately 4,000 people from throughout the Chicago metropolitan area.
