Founded in 1958, the Rapid City Club for Boys is dedicated to providing positive experiences that develop self-esteem and character in a caring, safe, and fun environment for all boys. The Club for Boys is committed to helping all boys meet their needs today so they can fulfill their potential tomorrow. In the mid 1980s, the Clubs' national organization, The Boys' Club of America, became the Boys and Girls Club of America. At this time Rapid City had an established Girls Club. So the Boys Club of Rapid City withdrew its membership from the national organization. A few years ago, the Club officially changed its name to the Rapid City Club for Boys. The Club fulfills many needs in the lives of the boys in the community and has been a consistent, positive influence.
