Preservation Virginia, a private statewide historic preservation leader founded in 1889, is dedicated to perpetuating and revitalizing Virginia's cultural, architectural and historic heritage thereby ensuring that historic places are integral parts of the lives of present and future generations. Preservation Virginia provides leadership, experience, influence, and services to the public and special audiences by saving, managing, and protecting historic places, and developing preservation policy, programs, and strategies with individuals, organizations, and local, state, and national partners. When Preservation Virginia was founded in 1889, a branch structure was established that gave the organization a broader base of membership. Today, the Branches act as advocates for preservation in their cities, counties or regions.
