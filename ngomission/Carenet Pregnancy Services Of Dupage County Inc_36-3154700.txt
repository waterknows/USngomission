Founded in 1981, CareNet Pregnancy Services of Dupage works to serve Jesus Christ by working to prevent unplanned pregnancies and by providing emotional support, spiritual counsel, and practical help to anyone dealing with the effects of an unplanned pregnancy. We work with young people, equipping them to make choices to avoid sexual activity and pregnancy, so that they can have the best future and fulfill their goals and dreams. We reach out to men and women who have an abortion in their past and are caught in a web of despair and grief. We seek to make an everlasting difference in the lives of women and their families by bringing them to saving faith.
