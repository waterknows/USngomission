Founded in 1987, The Make-A-Wish Foundation of New Hampshire grants the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions to enrich the human experience with hope, strength, and joy. Fulfilling a child's wish provides a joyful and meaningful experience that benefits both the child and the family. The staff and volunteers of New Hampshire strive to provide our children with the hope for better times, the strength for the tough times and the joy to experience the present. As part of the nation's largest and most recognized wish-granting organization, with chapters and volunteers throughout the United States and the world we draw on that strength, as well as our vast local network, to help children's dreams come true....right here in New Hampshire every day. Make-A-WishÂ® volunteers bring wishes to life with passion and creativity throughout the year as wish granters, fundraisers, ambassadors and office volunteers.
