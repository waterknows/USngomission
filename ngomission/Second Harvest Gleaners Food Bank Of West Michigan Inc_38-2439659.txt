Since 1981, Feeding America West Michigan Food Bank has served as West Michigan's regional nonprofit clearinghouse for saved, donated food on its way from the food industry to churches and charity agencies that assist needy people. The food we distribute is drawn primarily from the surpluses and edible/useable errors of local and national food and grocery products companies. Through our seven warehouses, we serve roughly 1,300 food pantries, homeless shelters, soup kitchens, domestic violence shelters, rescue missions, and other charity agencies across 40 Michigan counties. Each year, we distribute close to 25 million pounds of food and other goods.
