Chai Lifeline's mission is to bring joy and hope to seriously ill children and their families through year-round programs that offer social, emotional and financial support. Counseling, educational services, insurance advocacy, information and referrals, retreats, sibling programs, Big Brothers and Sisters, and recreational activities help the entire family cope with the daily challenges of living with illness. Hot meals, transportation assistance, patient navigation, and ongoing emotional support when children are in the midst of medical crises counter the isolation felt by families when children are ill. 



The organization is a leader in the field of illness camping. Its two overnight camps offer 450 children and teens with life-threatening illnesses, chronic conditions, and disabilities a summer filled with experiences and friendships that build confidence and skills as they motivate campers to fight the devastating effects of illness.
