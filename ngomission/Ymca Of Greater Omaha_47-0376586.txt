Strengthening community is our cause at the YMCA of Greater Omaha. We make life-changing impact to the children, adults and families we serve through programs that focus on three key areas: youth development, healthy living and social responsibility. The Y provides a variety of programs that support educational achievement, alternatives to teen violence, health/wellness, chronic disease intervention, child care, summer day camp, water safety, refugee assimilation, homework help, special needs integration and family programs. Through crucial partnerships with over 150 not-for-profit agencies, schools and organizations we are working hard to reach as many people as possible. The Y is open to all, regardless of their ability to pay for programs and services, and as a result we provide over $1,000,000 of financial assistance each year. The YMCA of Greater Omaha ensures that everyone, regardless of age, income or background, has the opportunity to thrive.
