MUST Ministries is a faith-based organization which for thirty-eight years has been dedicated to providing services to persons and families in crisis while maintaining their dignity. MUST is a place where one's faith can be put into action and where we can minister to the poor, the brokenhearted and those who are in crisis. Founded in 1971 and rooted in the Christian tradition, MUST addresses the basic needs of individuals, families, and children in the Marietta, Smyrna and Canton/Cherokee county communities. MUST brings people of many faiths together to respond to God's challenge to minister to others with compassion and love, without judgment of the beliefs, background or circumstances of those who serve or of those being served.
