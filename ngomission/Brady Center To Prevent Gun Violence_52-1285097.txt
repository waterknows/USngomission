As the largest national, non-partisan, grassroots organization leading the fight to prevent gun violence, the Brady Center To Prevent Gun Violence is dedicated to creating an America free from gun violence, where all Americans are safe at home, at school, at work, and in their communities. Founded in 1983, the Brady Center works to reform the gun industry and educate the public about gun violence through litigation and grassroots mobilization, and works to enact and enforce sensible regulations to reduce gun violence including regulations governing the gun industry. Our programs include Law Enforcement Relations, The Legal Action Project, God Not Guns Coalition, Hispanic/Latino Outreach, African-American Outreach, Linking with Victims for Change Network, and Steps to Prevent Firearm Injury in the Home. On November 1st, 2013, the Brady Center To Prevent Gun Violence merged with the Center to Prevent Youth Violence.
