The Pinelands Preservation Alliance (PPA) advocates for Pinelands preservation before government agencies like the New Jersey Pinelands Commission and seeks to educate the public about the Pinelands and the threats facing its natural resources. PPA's advocacy work is focused on four basic themes: monitoring public agencies, especially the Pinelands Commission; protecting the water quality of the Pine Barrens ecosystem; protecting the water supply embedded in the aquifers underlying the Pinelands and sustaining both the human and the natural communities of this region; and improving habitat protection for the distinctive, rare, threatened and endangered plant and animal species of the Pinelands.
