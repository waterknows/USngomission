Founded by Clara B. Spence in 1892, the Spence School works to educate girls and young women to the highest academic and personal standards necessary for responsible, effective citizenship and for the successful pursuit of higher education. The School is committed to the rigorous study of the liberal arts and sciences appropriate to Grades K-12. The development of high standards and character is considered as important as achievement in academic areas. The School integrates visual and performing arts, and athletics, both within its academic program and as extracurricular activities. Currently, total enrollment is 658 and our student/faculty ratio is 6:1.
