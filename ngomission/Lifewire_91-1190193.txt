Founded in 1982, LifeWire (formerly Eastside Domestic Violence Program) works to end domestic violence by changing individual, institutional and societal beliefs, attitudes and behaviors that perpetuate it. LifeWire provides safety, life-changing programs and supportive services to survivors and their children throughout their individual journey to regain strength and courage. We provide a continuum of innovative services that help victims survive abuse, mend and rebuild their lives. From advocacy and counseling to flexible housing solutions, we provide a comprehensive range of programs and supportive services for survivors and their families as they work their way through domestic violence, legal issues, homelessness and ongoing barriers to independence.
