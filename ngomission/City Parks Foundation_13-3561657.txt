Founded in 1989, City Parks Foundation (CPF) supports the vast majority of New York City parks without access to private resources. It is the only independent, non-profit organization to offer programming in parks throughout the five boroughs of New York City. By creating arts, sports and educational programs in over 750 public parks, and by encouraging community development within public parks as a focal point, we help to revitalize not only parks but also the neighborhoods that surround them. Our programs and community-building initiatives reach more than 600,000 New Yorkers each year, contributing to the renewal of neighborhoods throughout New York City with a particular focus on some of the city's most underserved areas.
