The mission of the San Antonio Food Bank (SAFB) is to fight hunger in southwest Texas through food distribution, programs, education, and advocacy. Founded in 1980, SAFB serves as a clearinghouse by receiving and storing truckloads of donated food, produce, and other grocery products. SAFB distributes these items in manageable quantities to approximately 400 service agencies that help people in need.
