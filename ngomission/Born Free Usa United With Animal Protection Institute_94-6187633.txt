Born Free USA united with Animal Protection Institute is a national animal advocacy organization. Our mission is to end the suffering of wild animals in captivity, rescue individual animals in need, protect wildlife - including highly endangered species - in their natural habitats, and encourage compassionate conservation globally. Every year, millions of animals suffer in fur farms and circus cages. In our campaigns against such cruelties, we use powerful tools including legislation, public education, litigation, and grassroots networking. We also work actively with media to spread the word about challenges facing animals. Our primary campaign areas currently include animals used in entertainment, captive exotic animals, trapping & fur, and the international wildlife trade.
