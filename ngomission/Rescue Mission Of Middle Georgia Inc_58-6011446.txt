The Rescue Mission of Middle Georgia (formerly the Macon Rescue Mission) is a faith-based organization providing residential programs and services to those facing homelessness, domestic violence, addiction and poverty. We seek to provide a path to recovery through Jesus Christ and exemplify His love in our community. Our programs include the Men's Life Recovery Program, a Women's Program for female survivors of domestic violence and their children, and community outreach services, including daily meal program for the transient homeless population throughout the year, a Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter Holiday Dinner for anyone in need, and delivery for elderly or disabled who are not able to leave their home. In addition we provide assistance with clothing, furniture and household items to those in need in the community.
