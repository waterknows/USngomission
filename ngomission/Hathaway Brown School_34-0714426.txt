Hathaway Brown School is dedicated to excellence in the education of girls. For us, educational excellence includes, but reaches well beyond, superb preparation for college. The true mission of the School, as reflected in our motto "Non scholae sed vitae discimus," is preparation for life. We strive to foster in the minds of our students an abiding passion for learning, and in their hearts a constant devotion to strong character and public service. At this moment in history there is a great need for women of vision and courage who are empowered for leadership in a multicultural and globalized society. We seek to answer that need by inspiring our students to achieve their utmost potential, and rise boldly to the challenges of their times.
