The Veterans of Foreign Wars National Home for Children provides children and families of members of the VFW, its Ladies Auxiliary and active-duty military opportunities for growth and development in a nurturing community, and by doing so, will serve as a living memorial to all veterans. The Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) established the National Home in 1925 to care for the children and families of our nation's veterans. Located on 629 acres in Eaton Rapids, Michigan, the National Home stands today as a tribute to the VFW and Ladies Auxiliary members who help support the facility and the families who call the National Home their home.
