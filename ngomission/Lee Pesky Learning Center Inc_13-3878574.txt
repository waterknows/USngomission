Lee Pesky Learning Center (LPLC) strengthens literacy (reading, writing, and math) in the community with an emphasis on helping those with learning disabilities. We achieve our mission by providing research-based assessment, academic instruction, and counseling to individuals and small groups; consultation and training to schools and educators to improve the literacy of all children; and literacy resources (books, curricula, classes, tools) to children, families, and communities. We provide one-on-one evaluation and academic intervention for individuals with learning differences at offices in Boise, Caldwell, Hailey, and Ketchum. We partner with schools to provide special academic intervention programs for children who are at risk of educational failure.
