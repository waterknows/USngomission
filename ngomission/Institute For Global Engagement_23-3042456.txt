The Institute for Global Engagement (IGE) promotes sustainable environments for religious freedom worldwide. As a faith-based organization, IGE believes firmly in universal human dignity and is committed to the protection of all faiths through the rule of law. IGE pursues this mission with a balanced approach, encouraging governments to understand and promote religious freedom (top-down engagement) and equipping citizens to exercise that right responsibly (bottom-up engagement). IGE's relational diplomacy in South, Central, and East Asia fosters relationships and practical agreements between government and religious leaders, enabling sustainable progress that is culturally owned and legally protected. IGE also sponsors two educational divisions focused on the role of religion in public life worldwide.
