The Hastings Center's mission is to address fundamental ethical issues in the areas of health, medicine, and the environment as they affect individuals, communities, and societies. To achieve this mission, the Center has established four goals: To pursue interdisciplinary research and education that includes both theory and practice. To engage a broad audience of thoughtful people in the work of the Center. To collaborate with policy makers, in the private as well as the public sphere, to identify and analyze the ethical dimensions of their work. To strengthen the international dimensions of the Center's work. Much of the Center's research addresses bioethics issues in three broad areas: care and decision making at the end of life, public health priorities, and new and emerging technologies.
