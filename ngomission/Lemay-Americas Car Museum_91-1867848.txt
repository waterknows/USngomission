Harold and Nancy LeMay amassed the largest privately owned collection of automobiles, motorcycles, trucks, other vehicles and related memorabilia in the world. In 1998, Harold and Nancy LeMay created The Harold E. LeMay Museum, now called LeMay - America's Car Museum (LeMay - ACM), and committed themselves to donating the vast LeMay Collection to the Museum for the benefit of the public. The LeMay -ACM was chartered to secure, preserve and interpret the valuable LeMay Collection, along with additional vehicles and artifacts that it may acquire, in order to explore the broad themes of American mobility and lifestyle in an instructive and entertaining manner.
