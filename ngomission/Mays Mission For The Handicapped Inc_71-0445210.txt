For over 35 years Mays Mission for the Handicapped has been providing opportunities to people with disabilities in areas of employment opportunities, scholarships, camperships, emergency monetary assistance and goodwill. Mays Mission offers scholarships to deserving individuals with physical and/or mental disabilities. Our current program supports seven college students. We also offer camperships, tours, on-the-job training, and a volunteer caregivers program.
