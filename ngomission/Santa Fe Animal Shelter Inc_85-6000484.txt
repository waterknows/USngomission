Founded in 1939, the Santa Fe Animal Shelter & Humane Society is the largest animal shelter and care facility in Northern New Mexico. More than 6,000 lost, stray, abandoned or injured animals come through our doors each year. We work to reunite people with their lost animal companions, and re-home those animals who have gone unclaimed into new homes through several methods, including adoptions, fosters and transfers. Low- and no-cost spay/neuter programs address the overpopulation problems that our community faces. Humane education programs in our local schools teach children to respect and care for all living creatures. Partnered with our community, we work for change in the lives of our companion animals and to end the suffering of all animals.
