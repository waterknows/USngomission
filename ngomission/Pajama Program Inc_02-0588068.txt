Founded in 2001, Pajama Program's mission is to provide a loving environment for children who have lived through a great deal of hurt in their young lives to give them hope for a better tomorrow. The program identifies key institutions in major cities in the U.S. and other countries where children are living temporarily as they wait and hope for adoption. It is to the children in these circumstances and temporary living quarters that the pajamas are delivered with love an affection.
