The Daniel Pitino Shelter was organized in 1993 with the expressed purpose of creating emergency and transitional housing for the growing number of homeless persons in Owensboro-Daviess County region. The Shelter is a non-denomination organization which offers both emergency and transitional housing, provides nutritional food, primary physical and mental health care, essential services, and educational enhancement including life skills, legal aid sources, and computer training within the same building. The Supportive Housing Program (SHP) serves as a safe and secure place, a sanctuary for homeless families, where the healing process can begin, rehabilitation directed, and independent living guided.
