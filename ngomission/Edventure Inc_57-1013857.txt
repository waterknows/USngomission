EdVenture's mission is to inspire children to experience the joy of learning. Behind EdVenture's doors, we are proud to have six world-class exhibit galleries, a library, learning laboratories, resource centers and other visitor amenities. Two additional outdoor gallery spaces are located just outside the museum's front doors. Within the total 85,000 square feet that is EdVenture Children's Museum, there are more than 350 individual hands-on exhibits. EdVenture's average annual attendance is 200,000. Since opening on November 8, 2003, EdVenture has welcomed visitors from all 50 states and 18 foreign countries.
