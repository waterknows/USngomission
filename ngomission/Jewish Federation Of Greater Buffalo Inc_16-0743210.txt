The Jewish Federation of Greater Buffalo seeks to bring Jewish people together, connected by our rich heritage, to strengthen the State of Israel, the universal Jewish family, and our own local organizations. The Federation is a fundraising, community relations and planning resource organization. With values of social justice and respect for human rights and dignity, we are committed to being a caring and compassionate community, to helping people in need, to ensuring that our heritage and values are passed on to our children, and to providing needed financial resources both locally, nationally and globally.
