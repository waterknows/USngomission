The Ronald McDonald House of Dallas (RMHD) is the only organization in Dallas that provides a temporary home-away-from-home for families whose children are receiving treatment for a serious illness or injury at a Dallas area hospital. In an effort to lessen the burden, reduce stress, keep the family intact, and enhance the quality of life for these families, the RMHD provides affordable housing in a caring home-like atmosphere. The Ronald McDonald House program was built on the simple idea that nothing else should matter when a family is focused on healing their child - not where they can afford to stay, where they will get their next meal, or where they will lay their head at night to rest.
