Founded in 1956, United Way of Abilene believes everyone deserves opportunities to have a good life: a quality education that leads to a stable job, enough income to support a family through retirement, and good health. That's why United Way's work is focused on the building blocks for a good life: education, income, and health. We work with our Community Partners to address the needs of today and tomorrow while seeking ways to create positive, lasting change. Everyone in West Central Texas is connected and interdependent. We all win when a child succeeds in school, when families are financially stable, and when people are healthy.
