St. Mark's School of Texas is a non-sectarian, college-preparatory, independent day school for boys in grades one through twelve. As a college preparatory institution, St. Mark's School of Texas prepares boys and young men for each successive step of their academic careers. However, our ambitions are not limited to the scholastic alone. It is our mission to educate the whole boy, providing each of our students with the tools necessary to be successful in and out of the classroom. Additionally, as a boys' school we are able to address clearly and directly the particular characteristics and learning needs that boys exhibit. Founded in 1906, the school currently has an enrollment of 841 boys.
