Union Rescue Mission (URM) is dedicated to serving people experiencing homelessness. Established in 1891, URM is one of the largest rescue missions of its kind in the United States and the oldest in Los Angeles. We provide a comprehensive array of emergency and long-term services to our guests, including: food, shelter, clothing, medical and dental care, recovery (life transformation) programs, transitional housing, legal assistance, education, counseling, and job training to men, women, children, and families. We embrace people experiencing homelessness with the compassion of Christ, giving hope and healing for a changed life, helping them to find their way home.
