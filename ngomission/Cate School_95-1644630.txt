Founded in 1910, the Cate School has grown from an initial class of 12 boys to a current enrollment of 264 boys and girls from across the United States and around the world. Students grow in wisdom, maturity and compassion as they learn the value of hard work, of service to others and of time spent outdoors. The academic program is at once rigorous and varied, and Cate graduates consistently enroll in the country's top colleges and universities. Through commitment, scholarship, companionship, and service, each member of the Cate community contributes to what our founder called the spirit of this place . . .all compounded of beauty and virtue, quiet study, vigorous play, and hard work.
