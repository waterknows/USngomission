Since 1963, the Arizona Kidney Foundation has been the major state voluntary health agency seeking the solution for kidney and urinary tract diseases through education, prevention and treatment. The Foundation's many programs bring help and hope to thousands of dialysis patients and transplant recipients, provide community education about kidney health and the prevention of chronic kidney disease, and encourage support of organ donation. Our mission is commitment to the prevention of kidney disease through awareness, education and research and to improve the quality of life for Arizonans with kidney disease.
