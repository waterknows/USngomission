Turning Points, founded in 1995, aims to provide, coordinate, and facilitate services to the homeless and those at risk of becoming homeless in Manatee County, Florida. Our Turning Points team located at the Bill Galvano One Stop Center provides friendly, caring, compassionate assistance to people that come for help with a wide variety of issues. The great appeal of the integrated approach to service delivery practiced at the Bill Galvano One Stop Center is people have their physical, emotional and spiritual needs addressed by a caring team of paid staff and volunteers who work closely together.
