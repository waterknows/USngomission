World Christian Broadcasting exists so that people in places best served by broadcast media become aware of the Good News of Jesus Christ and want to know more. World Christian Broadcasting's international shortwave broadcasting communicates the Good News to millions every day. KNLS, located at the top of the world in Anchor Point, Alaska, has been on the air since 1983. A new station is presently under construction in the region of the Indian Ocean. Through these shortwave transmissions, we can blanket highly populated regions such as China, Russia, Africa, the Middle East, and also hundreds of smaller areas. By speaking in people's own language, forming friendships, and creating bonds of trust, World Christian Broadcasting sparks hope, interest, and curiosity among listeners.
