Recognized as one of the nation's elite charity events, Celebrity Fight Night is a star-studded evening presented in honor of our featured guest, Muhammad Ali. Celebrities and professional athletes from all over the country participate in a night filled with incredible live auction items and live musical performances by many of today's brightest stars. This power-packed night of excitement not only leaves our audience with unforgettable memories each year but, more importantly, provides significant dollars for charities. Throughout Celebrity Fight Night's 20-year history $100 million has been raised with the Muhammad Ali Parkinson Center at Barrow Neurological Institute as the primary beneficiary. Numerous other charities have benefited and countless lives have been changed thanks to the tremendous generosity of our supporters.
