The Coast Guard Mutual Assistance's central purpose is to assist our clients during their time of financial need. In general, assistance is provided through counseling, short-term interest-free loans, financial grants, referrals, and other related means. Assistance is provided under a large variety of conditions and situations usually involving everyday essentials including emergency, housing, and medical needs that are beyond the individual's ability to meet at the time assistance is requested. Coast Guard Mutual Assistance strives to meet the valid, verified, and genuine need of our clients and their immediate family. Assistance should be used to supplement, not replace other forms of available assistance.
