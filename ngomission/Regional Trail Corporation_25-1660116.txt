The Regional Trail Corporation (RTC) is a partnership that works to acquire, develop, and manage appropriate trail corridors in southwestern Pennsylvania and to create and promote opportunities for recreation, tourism, economic development, and historic and environmental conservation. The Regional Trail Corporation was created in 1992 by Allegheny, Fayette, and Westmoreland Counties. The Youghiogheny River Trail (YRT) North section is our first project. The YRT North Section is a 43-mile limestone surfaced trail built along the Youghiogheny River between McKeesport and Connellsville in southwestern Pennsylvania and is designed as a non-motorized, shared-use, recreational trail for bicycling, walking, fishing and canoe access, hiking, nature study, historic appreciation, cross country skiing, picnicking, and horseback riding.
