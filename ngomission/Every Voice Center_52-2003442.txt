Every Voice Center (formerly Public Campaign) is a non-partisan organization dedicated to sweeping reform that aims to dramatically reduce the role of big special interest money in American politics. Every Voice Center is laying the foundation for reform by working with a broad range of organizations - including local community groups - around the country that are fighting for change in their states and national organizations whose members are not fairly represented under the current system. Together we are building a network of national and state-based efforts to create a powerful national force for federal and state campaign reform.
