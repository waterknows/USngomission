AID FOR AIDS International (AFAI) is committed to improving the quality of life of people with HIV or AIDS (PWHAs) in developing countries and for immigrants to the United States of America living with HIV. We work to empower PLWHAs, their caregivers, and the community at large by providing access to medications, health education, HIV prevention strategies and advocacy and by promoting leadership and capacity building for individuals and organizations.
