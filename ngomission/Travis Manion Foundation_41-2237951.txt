Shortly after the death of 1st Lt. Travis Manion in Iraq on April 29, 2007, the fallen Marine's mother, the late Janet Manion, founded the Travis Manion Foundation to assist our nation's veterans and families of the fallen. TMF engages with veterans and families of the fallen in all stages of their personal journeys and offers them unique opportunities to empower them to achieve their goals. TMF believes that the best way to honor the fallen is by challenging the living. TMF challenges veterans and survivors to lead the If Not Me, Then Who movement and inspire others to continue the service to community and country exemplified by the nation's fallen heroes.
