Opened in 1914, the Montclair Art Museum (MAM) collects, preserves, and presents American and Native American art. Its innovative exhibitions and educational programs interpret and explore relationships between these two evolving artistic traditions. MAM's exhibitions offer groundbreaking scholarship, fresh thematic approaches, first-time presentations of under-recognized artists, examinations of little-known aspects of major artists' careers, and an ongoing commitment to the artists and culture of New Jersey. MAM's Yard School of Art offers comprehensive courses for children, youth, adults, seniors, and professional artists. The Museum collaborates with numerous cultural and community partners to inspire creativity and a deeper understanding of America's unique diversity.
