Everyone deserves the opportunity to have a good life: a quality education that leads to a stable job, enough income to support a family through retirement, and good health. That's why United Way Worldwide is focused on the building blocks for a good life: education, income and health. Locally, the North Penn United Way (with a tremendous amount of input from community members) has identified three targeted Community Goals that we feel we are uniquely positioned to tackle. As an organization we will recruit and mobilize people and organizations from all across the community who bring passion, expertise and the resources needed to get things done. Our three Community Goals are: students succeeding in school; older adults remaining as independent and community-connected as possible ; and providing a strong safety net for people in crisis.
