We are committed to performing outstanding artistic productions, with the aim of delivering the highest level of enjoyment to our patrons. UFOMT's education outreach program, Opera by Children, has provided training for teachers and in-class mentoring for over 75,000 children to create their own operas in a classroom setting.
