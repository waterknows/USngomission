Founded in 1990, Elam works to strengthen and expand the church in the Iran region and beyond. Elam's vision is that all the people of the Iran region would have the opportunity to come to know the Lord Jesus Christ and follow Him as a disciple, and that they would be instrumental in taking the Gospel to other Muslims. To achieve this Vision, our goals are to: train leaders and workers to be effective ministers of the Gospel in the Iran region; equip the Church with resources that will assist them in their ministry to the people of the Iran region; and send leaders and workers to strengthen existing churches, establish new churches, and provide relief for the poor and persecuted.
