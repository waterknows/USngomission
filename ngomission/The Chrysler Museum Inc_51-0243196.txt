Founded in 1939 as the Norfolk Museum of Arts and Sciences, the Chrysler Museum of Art combines one of America's great fine arts museums and two significant historic houses. In addition to maintaining a distinguished permanent collection of 30,000 objects spanning nearly 5,000 years history, the Chrysler offers a comprehensive program of changing exhibitions and education activities for visitors of all ages. Our goal is to bring people and original works of art together. We believe that a visit to a museum should be both educational, providing visitors with a chance to learn more about themselves and their world, and fun.
