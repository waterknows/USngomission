New Moms equips struggling, impoverished adolescent parents (aged 13-24) and their children, through services and mentoring based on Christian values, with the personal and workforce development tools they will need, to permanently change their life stories from chronic dependence on society, to economic independence and family stability. The vision of New Moms is to be the model for an effective, efficient and enduring ministry that breaks the cycle of poverty among at-risk adolescent parents and their children.
