Founded in 2000, DonorsChoose.org allows citizen philanthropists to fund specific project requests from teachers in U.S. public schools. We make it personal: donors choose a project that moves them, and then they hear back from the classroom with photos and updates. DonorsChoose.org validates the project request and purchases the resources for the teacher. To date, we have funded over 400,000 classroom projects to bring learning alive for students, providing more than 11 million children with books, technology, supplies, funding for field trips or class visitors, and other resources. Our vision is of a nation where students in every community have the resources they need to learn.
