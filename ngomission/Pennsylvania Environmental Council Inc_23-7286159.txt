Founded in 1970, the Pennsylvania Environmental Council (PEC) protects and restores the natural and built environments through innovation, collaboration, education and advocacy. PEC believes in the value of partnerships with the private sector, government, communities and individuals to improve the quality of life for all Pennsylvanians. PEC develops new policies, programs and projects that solve environmental problems using market-based and other non-partisan, science-driven solutions; promotes the understanding of environmental issues by the public, communities, organizations, and decision-makers; and serves as a catalyst for legislative, regulatory and policy change by decision-makers to advance solutions that are in the best interest of the Commonwealth.
