The Vero Beach Museum of Art offers a wide range of art and humanities programs for adults, families, and children for nearly thirty years. Last year more than 20,000 individuals participated in Museum programming, from the sellout presentations of the International Lecture Series to the record-setting crowds for Children's Art Festival.
