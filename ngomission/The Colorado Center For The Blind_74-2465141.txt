Since its establishment in 1988, the Colorado Center for the Blind has provided innovative teaching techniques and philosophy that continues to have far-reaching effects on the lives of blind people, taking them to new heights of independence. At the Colorado Center for the Blind, we expect that blindness does not need to be limiting in any way. With our positive attitude, we have revolutionized the way the public thinks about blindness and have created vibrant programs that change negative myths into positive realities.
