Founded in 1968 by Rev. Les Thompson, the ministry of LOGOI is about "equipping God's Spanish people for works of service so that the body of Christ may be built up" (Eph. 4:12-13). God has used the ministry of LOGOI to touch the lives and ministries of over 300,000 pastors and church leaders throughout 22 countries. Thousands of churches have been planted, hundreds of dying churches and ministries have been revitalized, and countless lives have been brought to a saving faith in Jesus Christ. God has called the ministry of LOGOI to help national Spanish pastors--who have had little Bible training--become effective ministers of the Gospel. LOGOI provides both immediate and long-term help, advice, and encouragement to pastors and teaching leaders.
