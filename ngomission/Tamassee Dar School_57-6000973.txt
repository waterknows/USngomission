Tamassee DAR School is a children's home and family service organization offering multi-faceted programs to serve children and families in crisis. We believe that education is the key to success. Our programs and services are built on this belief. We focus on all aspects of learning and growing to help our children gain confidence, build relationships, and realize their potential.
