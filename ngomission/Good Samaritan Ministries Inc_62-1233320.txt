Good Samaritan Ministries is a faith-based ministry that provides for those in need through education, mentoring, and social services. We serve the poor, the needy, the destitute. We seek to serve the homeless and to reach out to prevent homelessness in the six counties of east Tennessee. We do this by providing essential goods and services to those experiencing both temporary and long-term financial hardship. Yes, we meet the basic needs of food, shelter, and clothing, but also seek to empower the escape from poverty. We recognize the God given dignity of each individual and participate in a ministry of restoration: one that enables wholeness as people realize their full potential in Christ. We do not work in isolation from the community. We work within a continuum of care alongside churches, individuals, agencies, as well as local, state, and federal government as we provide a combination of relief and long-term solutions to poverty and homelessness in our region.
