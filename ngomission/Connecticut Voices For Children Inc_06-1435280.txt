Founded in 1995, Connecticut Voices for Children (CT Voices) is a research-based public education and advocacy organization that works statewide to promote the well-being of Connecticut's children, youth and families. CT Voices advances its mission through high quality research and analysis, strategic communications, citizen education, and development of the next generation of advocates. Some of our goals are to reduce child poverty, assure that all Connecticut's students have the academic and technology skills to thrive in the world economy of the 21st century, continue to build a statewide chorus of informed citizen voices, and to nurture the next generation of citizen advocates.
