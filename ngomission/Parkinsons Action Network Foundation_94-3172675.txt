The Parkinson's Action Network (PAN) is the unified voice of the Parkinson's disease community - advocating for more than one million Americans and their families. Today PAN serves as the voice of Parkinson's on numerous public policy issues affecting the Parkinson's community. In addition to continuing our work on NIH funding and research, the Parkinson's community is now a powerful voice on many crucial issues including Parkinson's-specific programs at the Departments of Defense and Veteran's Affairs, FDA drug approval issues, HHS programs (Medicare and Social Security), and our continuing struggle to achieve research freedom for stem cell research.
