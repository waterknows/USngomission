The Arlington Food Assistance Center (AFAC) is dedicated to providing supplemental groceries to Arlington residents who cannot afford to purchase sufficient food to meet their basic needs. While our only mission is to feed the hungry, by relieving the food budget of our clients, we help prevent homelessness and allow our clients to make other necessary purchases without sacrificing their health, housing and nutritional needs. We provide groceries to families and individuals referred to us by the Arlington County Department of Human Services, other social service agencies, and the churches of Arlington. AFAC obtains surplus food at a minimal cost from wholesale suppliers and at no cost from private donors, local bakeries, supermarkets, farmers' markets and food drives.
