Kiddo! is made up of parents, teachers, business people, and active members of the community who, since 1982, have raised over $20 million to supplement our limited school budgets. We currently make a wealth of vital programs - including art, music, drama, poetry, dance, and technology - available to every child in our K-8 schools. Currently, the Mill Valley School District faces a difficult financial environment, with significant budget cuts from the state, increasing student enrollment and an economic downturn that limits property tax revenues. As the MVSD's main fundraising organization, Kiddo! is committed to raising the additional funds necessary to protect the quality education over 2,800 Mill Valley students receive.
