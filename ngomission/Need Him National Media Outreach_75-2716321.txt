Founded in 1996, the Need Him mission is to intentionally present the Gospel of Jesus Christ to all people, using all forms of media, and providing a way to respond. They have worked with dozens of different voice artists and ministries over the years to produce relevant and thought provoking radio spots. In addition, they have expanded into television commercials in order to meet people where they may not expect a conversation about Jesus Christ. The key in all their spots is the desire to create a live conversation about the Gospel. Need Him has always been striving to build the Kingdom of God through partnering with all forms of media outlets. From radio stations to bumper stickers, billboards to business cards, thousands of people have heard or seen the number and dialed, or the web address "Chataboutjesus.org" and chatted.
