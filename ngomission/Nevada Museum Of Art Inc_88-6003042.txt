Founded in 1931 as the Nevada Art Gallery, the Nevada Museum of Art (NMA) is the oldest cultural institution in Nevada. The NMA provides a forum for the presentation of creative ideas. We aspire to serve as a cultural resource for every member of our community. Through innovative programming and scholarship, the Museum provides the opportunity for people of all ages to encounter, engage, and enjoy a diversity of art experiences. The NMA's focus on its collections, education, and outreach are means to conserve, convey, and expand artistic knowledge.
