Founded in 1983, the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance (SUWA) works to preserve the outstanding wilderness at the heart of the Colorado Plateau and manage these lands in their natural state for the benefit of all Americans. SUWA promotes local and national recognition of the region's unique character through research and public education; supports both administrative and legislative initiatives to permanently protect the Colorado Plateau wild places within the National Park and National Wilderness Preservation System, or by other protective designations where appropriate; builds national support for such initiatives on both the local and national level; and provides leadership within the conservation movement through uncompromising advocacy for wilderness preservation.
