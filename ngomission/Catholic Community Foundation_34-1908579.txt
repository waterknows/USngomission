Dedicated to enriching the lives of others by encouraging faithful philanthropy, the Foundation supports the mission of the Diocese of Cleveland to provide for the spiritual, educational and charitable needs of people throughout Northeast Ohio. Since its inception in 2000, the Foundation has raised over $200 million to support our seminarians in their formation, provide financial assistance to the students in our Catholic schools, and offer social services to our neighbors in need.
