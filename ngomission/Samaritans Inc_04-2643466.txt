Samaritans' purpose is to alleviate despair, isolation, distress and suicidal feelings among individuals in our community, 24 hours a day; to educate the public about suicide prevention; and to reduce the stigma associated with suicide. We accomplish this through services that emphasize confidential, nonjudgmental, and compassionate listening. Samaritans' goal is to reduce the risk of suicide and increase awareness about suicide prevention throughout Greater Boston and MetroWest. We accomplish this through five suicide prevention programs.
