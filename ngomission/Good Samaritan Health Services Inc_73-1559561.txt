Founded in 1999, Good Samaritan Health Services is a non-profit organization that provides free, quality medical care to people in need through mobile clinics. We partner with local churches and volunteers to help run the mobile clinics and provide ministry with love and compassion. Through the use of two mobile medical units, Good Samaritan Health Services takes medical care to those who need it the most. Many who lack transportation are now able to find a medical clinic in their very own neighborhoods. Churches provide facilities for patient check-in and provide hundreds of caring volunteers who help operate the mobile medical clinics. At each Good Samaritan Health Services clinic, patients receive medical care in a safe and loving environment.
