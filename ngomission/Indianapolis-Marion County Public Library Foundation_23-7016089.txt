The Indianapolis Public Library Foundation supports and enhances programs, services and facilities of The Indianapolis Public Library and its partnerships in lifelong learning initiatives that benefit a diverse community. While tax dollars support basic library expenses such as staff salaries and building upkeep, a need exists to develop and maintain quality programs and services for people in our community. The Library Foundation's support delivers, in part or in whole, many of these important initiatives that patrons have grown to know and appreciate through the generations.
