The AIMS Project, also known as Healthcare Charities, Inc., was established in 1995 for the purpose of supporting international health and community services. The AIMS Hospital is the recipient of such support and has shipped over 60 ocean containers and over 25 air freight shipments of medical equipment and supplies to the hospital. AIMS brings together a dedicated team of physicians, nurses, and other healthcare professionals to provide the highest standards of medical treatment. Our full range of primary and specialty care medical services enables cross-specialty consultation, which assures outstanding treatment for each patient.
