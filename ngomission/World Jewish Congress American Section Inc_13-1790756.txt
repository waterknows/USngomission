The World Jewish Congress-American Section is an affiliate of the World Jewish Congress (WJC) in the United States of America. Its main focus is on facilitating American Jewish input into the WJC's global deliberations; encouraging American efforts to fight international anti-Semitism and promote tolerance; and reaching out to a new generation of Jewish leaders in the United States. Beyond including new faces and new ideas, opportunities and relationships are being developed so the American Section reflects the full range of themes, affinities, and generations. No organization by itself can bridge the gaps in American Jewish life, and the American Section draws inspiration from the global inclusiveness of the World Jewish Congress and from exciting initiatives within American Jewry.
