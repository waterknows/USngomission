The New Jersey Audubon Society (NJAS) is a privately supported, statewide membership organization. Founded in 1897, and one of the oldest independent Audubon societies, NJAS has no connection with the National Audubon Society. The New Jersey Audubon Society fosters environmental awareness and a conservation ethic among New Jersey's citizens; protects New Jersey's birds, mammals, other animals, and plants, especially endangered and threatened species; and promotes preservation of New Jersey's valuable natural habitats. NJAS endeavors to develop and support sound conservation practices and legislation; disseminate information on the natural environment; and to acquire, establish, and maintain wildlife sanctuaries and educational centers.
