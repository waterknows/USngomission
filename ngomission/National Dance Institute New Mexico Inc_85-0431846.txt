NDI New Mexico was founded with the knowledge that the arts have a unique power to engage and motivate children. The purpose of our distinctive programs is to help children develop discipline, a standard of excellence, and a belief in themselves that will carry over into all aspects of their lives. Our work is guided by our belief in children, as well as our commitment to social responsibility, excellence, sustainability and financial integrity.
