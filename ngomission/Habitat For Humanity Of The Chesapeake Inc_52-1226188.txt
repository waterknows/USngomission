On July 1, 2009, Arundel Habitat for Humanity and Chesapeake Habitat for Humanity merged to become Habitat for Humanity of the Chesapeake. Putting faith into action, our organization brings people together to build decent, affordable homes that change lives, empower families and strengthen communities. While most Habitat for Humanity affiliates build new houses from the foundation up, Habitat for Humanity of the Chesapeake also renovates the existing housing stock in Baltimore and Annapolis neighborhoods in order to provide safe, affordable homes while eliminating vacant properties. Since its incorporation in 1982, Chesapeake Habitat has completed more than 300 homes and has housed more than 900 family members, including at least 500 children.
