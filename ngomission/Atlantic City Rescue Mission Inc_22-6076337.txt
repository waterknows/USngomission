Atlantic City Rescue Mission is a Christian social service ministry helping the poor and homeless in southern New Jersey since 1964. People who have no home receive practical help, counseling, and Christian compassion. Through effective, innovative, Christian-based recovery programs, people are brought from despair into a productive, good quality of life within the community. Because we believe that people should be fed, sheltered, and clothed, but they should also be given the chance to change their lives and become employed members of the community living in their own housing.
