The Federation of American Scientists promotes a safer and more secure world by developing and advancing solutions to important science and technology security policy problems by educating the public and policy makers, and promoting transparency, through research and analysis to maximize impact on policy. FAS was founded in 1945 by scientists who worked on the Manhattan Project. These scientists recognized that science had become central to many key public policy questions. FAS works to provide science-based analysis of and solutions to protect against catastrophic threats to national and international security such as: reducing the spread and number of nuclear weapons, preventing nuclear and radiological terrorism, promoting high standards for nuclear energy's safety and security, and tracking the global illicit trade of conventional, nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. FAS also pushes to make our government more transparent and promotes new mechanisms for curbing secrecy.
