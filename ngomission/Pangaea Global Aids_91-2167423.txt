Pangaea Global Aids Foundation's mission is to advance the health and well-being of people most affected by AIDS, by: partnering with countries and their supporters to develop, implement, evaluate and advocate for cost-effective, comprehensive HIV services - particularly as they enhance prevention strategies - for vulnerable, marginalized populations, including girls and women, men who have sex with men, and injection drug users; engaging underutilized sectors (including the private sector and faith based organizations) to expand the reach and quality of national AIDS programs. Working with partners across Africa, Asia and the Pacific for nearly a decade, we currently have partnerships in Tanzania, Zimbabwe, China and the United States.
