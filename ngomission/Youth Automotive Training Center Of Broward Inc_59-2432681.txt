Founded by Jim Moran in 1984, the mission of the Youth Automotive Training Center (YATC) is to train and educate at-risk youth in basic automotive repair skills, academic remediation, job readiness and life management skills. The goal of this program is to prepare young adults who are at a disadvantage in their lives to become self-sufficient, productive, law-abiding citizens. YATC is unique in that its support does not end at graduation. The school continues to provide resources and opportunities to graduates to help them stay on the right track. YATC has developed from a one-room training center into a 16,000 square-foot modern facility featuring technical and academic classrooms, a computer learning center/library, state-of-the-art automotive shop, conference room, lunch room and fitness room.
