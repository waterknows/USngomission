FoodLink for Tulare County is committed to ending hunger by providing healthy food and nutrition education to those in need through community involvement. FoodLink has been working to end hunger in Tulare County since 1978. FoodLink warehouses and distributes millions of pounds of food annually to a network of more than 80 local nonprofit agencies, which directly feed needy families. In 2009, food distributed through FoodLink's efficient network of food collection, preservation, and distribution reached more than 120,000 people, with more than two thirds of those served being children. But food distribution alone is not enough to end hunger in our area. FoodLink also works to combat hunger through hunger-relief advocacy, and to eliminate its long-term effects through proper nutrition and health education.
