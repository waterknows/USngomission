Community Shares of Illinois represents a diverse group of charities with a common mission, to make our world a better place. Whatever your passion - women's issues, protecting children, helping animals, preserving the environment, promoting health care or curbing poverty and disease - Community Shares members provide options for you to help make positive change in your own community. In 2003, the Illinois Women's Funding Federation (IWFF) and the Public Interest Fund of Illinois (PIFI) joined forces and created Community Shares of Illinois. Restructuring as Community Shares of Illinois strengthens our ability to provide support to community-based organizations throughout our state.
