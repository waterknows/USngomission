Ministry with Community works to improve lives by providing food, daytime shelter and other services to people in Kalamazoo struggling with homelessness, poverty, mental illness and other challenges. Ministry with Community was founded in 1978 by a small group of people led by Dorothy Markusse. The mission continues: to improve lives by providing food, daytime shelter, and other services to people in Kalamazoo struggling with homelessness, poverty, mental illness and other challenges. Through community cooperation, we provide these services in an atmosphere of dignity, hope and unconditional acceptance.
