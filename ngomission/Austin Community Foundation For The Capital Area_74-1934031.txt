Austin Community Foundation fosters an ecosystem of philanthropy to create meaningful change in Austin. We do so by providing efficient and effective giving tools for donors, impactful grants for nonprofits and collaborative leadership around the most pressing needs in our community. Through the generosity and vision of our donors we grant more than $20 million annually, mostly through donor advised funds. Founded in 1977, we are the third largest charitable foundation in Central Texas by grants distributed. Through our long-term investment strategies we create assets for tomorrow while building a community of givers today.
