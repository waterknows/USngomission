Since 1968, Sheridan House has positively impacted South Florida, growing from a single house caring for eight middle school age boys with behavioral problems to a Residential Program with five homes, two Counseling Centers and a Single Parent Division. The Residential Program addresses the needs of middle school boys and girls in a home-like setting while the Counseling Center and Single Parent Division address the needs of the whole family in a community center type setting. Sheridan House is also involved nationally in teaching the basics necessary to grow a healthy family in today's society.
