Founded in 1980, Martha's Table is dedicated to finding solutions to poverty in the short term and the long term. We address emergency needs with food and clothing programs and break the long cycle of poverty with education and family strengthening programs. Each year, we provide education, food, and opportunity with: (1) Tutorial, learning, and recreational programs during the school year and the summer for approximately 300 children and youth, ages 3 months to 18 years; (2) Meals to the homeless every day of the year at numerous sites throughout the city as well as meals for senior shut-ins and community holiday meals (3) Family support services, a clothing distribution center, and information; (4) An expansive volunteer program that allows 10,000 people annually to reach out to their community; and (5) Collaborations with other organizations to best provide a wide array of services.
