ArtsFund strengthens arts in the Puget Sound region by raising and responsibly allocating funds to promote artistic and organizational excellence and by advocating for all the arts. Through ArtsFund, everybody can take part in art. ArtsFund donors support nearly 70 local arts groups, large and small, so they can provide stimulating and enlightening arts for our community. ArtsFund also helps arts groups run themselves even better through systematic feedback on their operations, based on our finely crafted allocations process. ArtsFund also serves as an advocate for the arts through TakePartInArt.org, through programs like Building for the Arts and our Board Leadership Training program. The bottom line is that ArtsFund's cash grants, capacity building, and other services make arts groups stronger so they can serve this region and make it a great place to live, work, raise a family and run a business.
