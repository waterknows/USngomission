The Unity Shoppe provides the basic necessities of life while encouraging self-sufficiency and independent living during periodic times of crisis for low-income families, children, the elderly, and those affected by fire, flood and disaster. We provide a "Central Distribution Facility" for the use of all non-profit agencies, social service organizations, churches, schools and hospitals. Over 300 different service groups are now referring their low-income clients to this facility during times of crisis.
