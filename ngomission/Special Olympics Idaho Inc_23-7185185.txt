Special Olympics Idaho provides training and athletic competition in 15 Olympic-type sports, year-round and free of charge to over 2,500 children and adults with intellectual disabilities throughout the state of Idaho.

Special Olympics programs, with over 6,000 volunteers, offer athletes continuing opportunities to develop physical fitness, demonstrate courage, experience joy and participate in a sharing of gifts, skill, and friendship with their families, other Special Olympics athletes and the community. Funding comes from the generous donations of individuals, businesses and corporations, as well as from private grants and foundations. Through public awareness and volunteer recruitment, we hope to reach and serve potential athletes who are waiting for their opportunity to participate.
