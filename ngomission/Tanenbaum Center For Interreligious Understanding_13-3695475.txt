Founded in 1992, the Tanenbaum Center for Interreligious Understanding promotes mutual respect with practical programs that bridge religious difference and combat prejudice in areas of armed conflict, schools, workplaces, and health care settings. These practical programs, Workplace, Health Care, Education, and Conflict Resolution, build a safer, more equitable world for people of all belief systems. Today, each of Tanenbaum's programs is a leader in its field, creating innovative tools and resources to help people successfully navigate a religiously diverse world.
