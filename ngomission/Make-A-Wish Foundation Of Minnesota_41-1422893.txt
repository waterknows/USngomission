Founded in 1982, the Make-A-Wish Foundation of Minnesota's mission is to grant the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions to enrich the human experience with hope, strength, and joy. Fulfilling a child's wish provides a joyful and meaningful experience that benefits both the child and the family. During bleak times when these children and their families are facing surgeries, treatments, high medical bills and diminished spirits, a wish come true is often an essential ingredient to boost children's attitudes and emotional strength. The Make-A-Wish Foundation of Minnesota has granted more than 3,000 wishes.
