The Center for Excellence in Education (CEE), founded in 1983, nurtures careers of excellence and leadership in science and technology for academically talented high school and college students. CEE is dedicated to encouraging international understanding among future leaders of the world. CEE's programs challenge students and assist them on a long-term basis to become the creators, inventors, scientists, and leaders of the 21st century. The Center's programs help keep the United States competitive in science and technology and further international understanding among future leaders of the world. Today, the Center sponsors three programs for high school students and teachers: the Research Science Institute (RSI), the USA Biology Olympiad and the Teacher Enrichment Program.
