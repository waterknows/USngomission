The Boys & Girls Clubs of Broward County joined the national Boys & Girls Clubs organization in 1965 and have grown along with the movement. We now have 13 facilities with a membership of over 13,000 youth. Our purpose is to help young people ages 7-17 improve their lives by building self-esteem and developing values and skills during their critical period of growth. Services and programs provide focus on everything from education, social recreation, health and physical education, to leadership and citizenship development, cultural enrichment, and personal adjustment with one-on-one counseling. The mission of the Boys & Girls Clubs is to assure and to enhance the quality of life for children as participating members of a diverse urban society.
