The World Institute on Disability is an internationally recognized public policy center organized by and for people with disabilities. It works to strengthen the disability movement through research, training, advocacy and public education to help people with disabilities throughout the world enjoy increased opportunities to live independently. Founded in 1983 by leaders of the Independent Living Movement, WID's work focuses on issues and problems that directly affect people's ability to live full and independent lives. WID's programs address employment, economic development and financial stability issues; conduct research and policy analysis on personal assistance services, accessible health care, technology and other topics; and provide assistance to NGOs and disabled leaders in developing countries.
