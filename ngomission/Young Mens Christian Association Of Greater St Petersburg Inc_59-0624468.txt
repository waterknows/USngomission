Since 1920, the YMCA of Greater St. Petersburg has helped people in our community and has met the ever-changing needs of children, families, and our surrounding communities. Our commitment to living our charitable mission each day keeps us strong and focused. Our mission is to put Judeo-Christian principles into practice through programs that build healthy spirit, mind and body. Our commitment to our mission is exemplified by embracing these organizational values that set us apart as the preeminent family service organization in the community: integrity, strengthening families, respect, compassion and welfare. The YMCA incorporates its core values of caring, honesty, respect, responsibility, and faith in its policies, programs, and partnerships.
