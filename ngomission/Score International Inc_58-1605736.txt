SCORE International is a short term mission organization founded in 1984 by Ron Bishop. Originally founded as a sports ministry, SCORE has evolved into a full service mission organization. SCORE provides all inclusive trips that are managed by our qualified staff and missionaries. Each trip offers lodging, meals, trip insurance, ground transportation, interpreters, ministry set-up and a trip coordinator. These all inclusive trips make it easy for you to JUST GO!
