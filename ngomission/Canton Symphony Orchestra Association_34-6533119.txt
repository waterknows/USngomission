Founded in 1937, the Canton Symphony Orchestra (CSO) performs and presents at the highest possible artistic level live orchestral music to enrich, entertain, educate, and challenge diverse audiences in a variety of settings. The orchestra performs both standard and contemporary repertoire, and annually begins the classical series with a work by an American composer. It commissions new music, and it showcases established guest soloists and new young talent. The CSO provides service to American orchestras by offering its musicians experience in performing a wide range of repertoire, under the direction of conductors of high quality.
