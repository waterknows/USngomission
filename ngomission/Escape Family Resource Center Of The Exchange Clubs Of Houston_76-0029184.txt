ESCAPE Family Resource Center prevents child abuse and neglect before a child is hurt by providing education, intervention, and support programs to families in crisis. Founded in 1983 by Houston-area chapters of the National Exchange Club, we offer classes at multiple locations in the Greater Houston area in English and Spanish. In 2007, ESCAPE launched the LearnToParent movement, which provides families with cutting-edge parenting techniques, including effective alternatives to corporal punishment. Parents and children are taught skills to cope with stress, communicate effectively, and modify one another's improper behavior without resorting to punishment.
