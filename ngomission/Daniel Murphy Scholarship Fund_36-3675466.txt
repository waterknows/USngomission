The Daniel Murphy Scholarship Foundation (DMSF) was founded in 1989 by ten Chicago-based business associates, who set out to enrich the lives of Chicago youth by providing them with educational opportunities they would otherwise be unable to access. DMSF's mission is to provide four-year high school scholarships and academic support services to economically disadvantaged Chicago 8th grade students who demonstrate academic potential, in order to ensure they are properly prepared for college. DMSF works to ensure that financial constraints do not hinder a young person's ability to obtain a quality education.
