Founded in 1994, Walkway Over the Hudson works to support and improve Walkway Over the Hudson State Historic Park by building new amenities and features that help this grand attraction realize its full potential. Throughout the year, the Walkway organization implements programming and events designed to enlighten and bring enjoyment to the park's expected 750,000 annual visitors. We also recruit and train volunteers to serve as guides, ambassadors, and support staff.
