John Wayne Cancer Institute (JWCI) at Saint John's Health Center is a cancer research institute dedicated to the understanding and curing of cancer in order to eliminate patient suffering worldwide. Our mission is accomplished through innovative clinical and laboratory research and the education of the next generation of surgical oncologists and scientists. Since 1981, the John Wayne name has been committed by the Wayne Family to leading-edge cancer research and education, in memory of their father who died of stomach cancer in 1979. The Institute conducts multidisciplinary basic, clinical translational research on many complex cancer problems, focusing in particular on melanoma, breast cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, and sarcoma.
