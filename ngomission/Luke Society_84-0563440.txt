The Luke Society is an interdenominational organization of Christian health and business professionals dedicated to medical missions. We support indigenous Christian health professionals who have a vision to reach their own people. Our focus is on community health--teaching people how to prevent disease and equipping people to care for themselves, their families and their communities. Besides teaching prevention, we also provide medical care for the sick and comfort for the dying. When appropriate, we help initiate economic development projects to assist people in providing for their families. Most important, ours is a Christ-centered ministry of evangelism and discipleship, reconciling man to God, and man to man through the truth of the gospel.
