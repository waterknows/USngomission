Community Action Services and Food Bank works to stabilize families and then rebuild their lives. We help meet their basic needs (food, shelter, housing) while providing the long-term solutions needed to rebuild their financial and social self sufficiency, enabling them to break out of poverty. Our programs include a food bank, family development, homeless prevention, home buyer and mortgage counseling, the Circles Initiative, community gardens, and a commercial kitchen. Community Action has served the low-income population of Utah, Wasatch and Summit counties in Utah since 1967. We work with others in the community to develop solutions to address poverty and its effects.
