Founded in 2006, Justice at Stake leads a nonpartisan national partnership of more than 50 organizations, protecting our justice system through public education, litigation and reform. We defend what Chief Justice Rehnquist called the "crown jewel" of American democracy. Since 2000, Justice at Stake has won victories in the U.S. Supreme Court and statehouses across the country. Our communications research has changed how judges and opinion makers defend fair courts. Justice at Stake has earned national attention for impartial-justice issues, including reporting by the New York Times, Washington Post, USA Today, Time, Economist, Bloomberg News, PBS, CNN and ABC.
