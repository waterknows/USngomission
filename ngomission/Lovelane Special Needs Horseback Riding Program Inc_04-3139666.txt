In a fun, supportive environment, Lovelane provides high-quality therapeutic horseback riding to achieve occupational, physical, speech, cognitive and other therapeutic gains, focusing on children with special needs. Lovelane is about abilities: the ability of a student to improve his or her quality of life; the ability of a student to increase self-esteem and confidence; the ability to participate in an outdoor activity that is fun. Each of our students enjoys a program that combines the best aspects of a world-class sport with important occupational, physical and speech therapy goals. Lovelane currently has 13 licensed riding instructors and provides more than 4,400 individual therapeutic riding sessions a year to children and young adults from 41 MetroWest and greater Boston communities. In September 2004, we moved into our first fully owned and operated facility -- our first permanent home and our first facility with an indoor riding arena!
