Partners With Haiti was incorporated in 1981, and works to exalt Jesus Christ by assisting the National Evangelical Church in Haiti and elsewhere, in preaching and teaching the whole counsel of God and providing social assistance in education, medicine, feeding, housing, and job creation. Partnering with churches and individuals in the United States, Partners With Haiti serves primarily in educating churches, transmitting funds, and giving support to various projects, ministries and churches in Haiti. The ministry of Partners With Haiti has expanded greatly and today it is a channel through which thousands of Haitian people and many diversified ministries are supported.
