Since its founding in 1982, the North Carolina Coastal Federation (NCCF) has worked with citizens to safeguard the coastal rivers, creeks, sounds and beaches of North Carolina. NCCF works in four key program areas: strengthening environmental standards; encouraging enforcement of environmental laws; restoring and protecting habitat and water quality; and educating citizens and community leaders. Today NCCF consists of more than 10,000 members, 150 affiliated organizations, 3000 active volunteers and a 22 member professional staff, and is considered the largest and one of the most effective coastal conservation groups in the state.
