Long Island Children's Museum (LICM) invites visitors of all ages, backgrounds, and abilities to explore freely, discover their passions, and appreciate the communities and world we share. First opened in 1993, LICM now serves more than 265,000 children and adults annually across the metropolitan region and is Long Island's most well-attended museum. It is home to 14 hands-on, interactive exhibit galleries, a 145-seat state-of-the-art theater and three classroom-size learning studios. Indoor and outdoor gallery spaces are interdisciplinary, age-appropriate, and intergenerational, fostering both independent and cooperative exploration, and encouraging concept development and skills building.
