Founded in 1995, Caldera's mission is to be a catalyst for the transformation of underserved youth through innovative, year-round art and environmental programs. We begin working with youth in 6th grade and commit to working with them year-round through high school graduation and beyond. We become community. The adult programs offer residencies to professional artists.
