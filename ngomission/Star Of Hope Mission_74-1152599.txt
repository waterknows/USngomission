Founded in 1907, Star of Hope is a Christ-centered community dedicated to meeting the needs of homeless men, women and their children. Positive life changes are encouraged through structured programs which focus on spiritual growth, education, employment, life management and recovery from substance abuse. On any given day, there are approximately one thousand homeless men, women and children being helped at the Men's Development Center, the Women and Family Emergency Shelter, the Transitional Living Center for Women & Families and New Horizons. The key to the success of Star of Hope Mission is its comprehensive approach to addressing the diverse issues, both immediate and long term, that impact homeless individuals and families.
