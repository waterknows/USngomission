The Longyear Museum's mission is to advance the understanding of the life and work of Mary Baker Eddy, the discoverer, founder and leader of Christian Science. The Museum contains documents pertaining to her life and the lives of Christian Scientists who assisted her in establishing this worldwide religion. Longyear Museum was founded by philanthropist Mary Beecher Longyear to provide future generations with documentary evidence and facts about Mrs. Eddy and the early history of the Christian Science religion. In 1937, the Museum opened in Mrs. Longyear's former home in Brookline, Massachusetts. The Museum moved to its present location in nearby Chestnut Hill in 1999; the new exhibit halls were opened to the public in 2001.
