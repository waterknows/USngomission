Our mission at National Child Safety Council (NCSC), is to prevent needless childhood accidents and help save lives through meaningful safety education. NCSC's goal is to study, improve, and facilitate the continuing safety education of school age children; to provide safety educational materials to local law enforcement departments to improve and promote the cooperation these agencies have with schools, businesses, concerned citizens, parents, and children in safety education; and to safeguard children through instruction from injury or death arising out of preventable accidents.
