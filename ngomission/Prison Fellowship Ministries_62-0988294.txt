Prison Fellowship Ministries believes that no life is beyond the reach of God's power. Through partnership with the local church and other nonprofit organizations, we work together to meet the spiritual, physical, and personal needs of prisoners and their families with the ultimate goal of seeing them restored to Christ, their families, and their communities. We believe that no life is beyond the reach of God's power, and we envision a future in which countless prisoners, ex-prisoners, and their families, are redeemed, restored, and reconciled through the love and truth of Jesus Christ.
