Since 1984, Island Press has been publishing the best new ideas on sustainability and the environment and working to spread those ideas to help people make a positive difference in the world. We publish an average of 30 new books annually on critically important topics such as ocean and marine conservation, land conservation, green buildings, ecosystems, sustainable agriculture, climate change, and ecological restoration. Island Press authors and experts inform and inspire change by reaching out to millions of people through the press, online, in the classroom, and in person. Today, with more than 1,000 titles in print, an active slate of author programs and events, and a growing online presence, we have emerged as one of the nation's leading providers of information on environmental issues and a leading communicator of environmental ideas.
