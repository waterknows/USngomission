The Pro-Life Action League was founded by Joseph M. Scheidler in 1980 with the aim of saving unborn children through non-violent direct action. Some of the Pro-Life Action League's key activities include: abortion clinic presence, public protest, confronting the abortionists, promoting and defending activism, broadcasting the pro-life message, and youth outreach. The Pro-Life Action League seeks to influence public opinion on the issue of abortion and related life issues. Additional activities to support this goal include a private phone hotline message, articles published in various publications available to the public, as well as our own newspaper, Pro-Life Action News.
