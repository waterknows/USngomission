Rodeheaver Boys Ranch provides a wholesome home environment with religious, educational and vocational training for at-risk boys. These boys have no home of their own because of parental death, desertion, divorce, disability or dysfunction. Rodeheaver Boys Ranch provides these deserving young men a second chance in life and an opportunity to build a strong foundation for the future. Rodeheaver Boys Ranch has been carrying out this mission since 1950.
