The Gibbes Museum of Art is temporarily closed for renovations and will reopen in the spring of 2016.



The Gibbes Museum of Art offers through collection, exhibition, interpretation, and educational opportunities a thorough knowledge of the visual culture of Charleston, the Lowcountry, and the American South from the Colonial Era through today. The Museum engages adults and children, residents and visitors in the beauty, boldness, and artistic achievement of this unique American region.
