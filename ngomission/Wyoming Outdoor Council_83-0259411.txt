The Wyoming Outdoor Council is Wyoming's oldest independent statewide conservation group. In 1967, Tom Bell, founder of High Country News, came together with other conservation leaders to establish the Wyoming Outdoor Council. Since then, the Wyoming Outdoor Council has grown to a nationally recognized leader in protecting Wyoming's natural heritage. Our role is to protect the state's world-class public lands and wildlife, safeguard our enviably clean air and water, and blaze the trail toward sustainable energy. We influence the actions of a diverse set of decision-makers, including industry and agency officials. We educate and activate citizens, work in alliances with conservation, religious, and labor groups, and when all else fails, we take legal action to meet our mission, which is to protect Wyoming's environment and quality of life for future generations.
