The leading animal welfare organization in the Upper Midwest, the Animal Humane Society is committed to engaging and serving local communities of people and animals by providing comprehensive programs and services to compassionately serve all of the stages of an animal's life. At our campuses in Buffalo, Coon Rapids, Golden Valley, St. Paul and Woodbury, our mission is to engage the hearts, hands and minds of the community to help animals. Our programs at our five campuses include adoption and surrender, outreach, rescue, pet training and boarding. Animal Humane Society assisted over 23,000 animals in 2013.
