Georgia Center for Opportunity is an independent, non-partisan think tank dedicated to increasing opportunity and improving the quality of life for all Georgians. We research solutions to society's most pressing challenges, promote those solutions to policymakers and the public, and help innovative social enterprises deliver results on the ground. The defining idea of America is a nation where everyone has an opportunity to achieve a better life. Americans believe everyone should have the chance to succeed through talent and hard work, regardless of the circumstances of their birth. Our mission is to remove barriers to opportunity.
