The Selous Foundation - a think tank - founded in 1985, has as its mission the study of conflict over institutions and the distribution of resources that has been so pervasive throughout history, with a view toward the formulation and promotion of public policies based on the American values and benefits of individual liberty, freedom, limited government and the primacy of national sovereignty.
