Since opening our doors in 1988, Covenant House Alaska (CHA) has served thousands of homeless and runaway youth in Alaska. Through the years, we have expanded our services and adapted our programs to meet the changing needs of the community. However, our mission to serve the suffering children of the streets has remained the same. At CHA, our sole purpose is to be available to help youth in crisis 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Through our three main programs, we meet the basic needs of youth in crisis, while also providing them with the support to become healthy, self-sufficient, contributing members of our community.
