The Dayton Society of Natural History is the parent organization of the Boonshoft Museum of Discovery and its sister organization, SunWatch Indian Village, a partially reconstructed Fort Ancient period Native American village along the Great Miami River. The Boonshoft Museum's mission is to be the premier regional provider of interactive science learning experiences which enrich the lives of children and adults, enhance the quality of life in our community, and promote a broad understanding of the world. The Museum also works to preserve, protect, and enhance its anthropology, geology, paleontology, and biology collections, and to make these collections available for exhibition, education, and research purposes.
