Graywolf Press was incorporated in 1984, and is considered one of the nation's leading nonprofit literary publishers. Graywolf Press is dedicated to the creation and promotion of contemporary literature. The organization serves literary writers and readers whose work and concerns are overlooked in other publishing environments. Graywolf strives to be creative, inclusive and collaborative in its programming. All of the organization's publications are distributed and promoted internationally. Promotion and outreach efforts also include author readings, discussion panels, lectures and classes conducted by staff. A commitment to quality, and a willingness to embrace or invent new models, has kept Graywolf at the forefront of the small press movement.
