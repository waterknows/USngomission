Established in 1971, the Optimist International Foundation has been instrumental in providing significant funding for the charitable, literary and educational purposes of Optimist International, a community service based organization committed to creating a more optimistic future for young people through innovative programs. Optimist volunteers serve as leaders, mentors and friends to help kids achieve a more positive and productive life. Optimists create opportunities for youth as they develop into adulthood and become role models for future generations. Optimists believe that a positive approach can make all the difference in the world. Through service programs, Optimists develop positive attitudes and approaches to life that enable young people to excel in school and in their community.
