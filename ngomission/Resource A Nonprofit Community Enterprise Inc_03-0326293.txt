In 1991 in Burlington, Vermont, ReCycle North began an innovative program of repairing and reselling household items that otherwise would have gone to the dump. Out of that founding vision, more than 750 people have received job training and skills essential to gainful employment, 10,000 low-income people have received needed household goods and building materials, more than 10,000 tons of materials have been kept from the landfill, and 50 people now have secure employment through income earned largely from this social enterprise. ReCycle North changed it's name to ReSOURCE in 2009 and continues to meet community and individual needs through education and job skills training, environmental stewardship, and economic opportunities.
