The Jewish Federation of Rockland County is one place in the community that every Jew can call home, no matter their affiliation. It is the heart and soul of the Jewish community, raising money to support local programs, services and organizations. Locally we support our JCC, where programs serve everyone from infants to seniors. Our Jewish Family Service provides counseling and special needs support, while the Holocaust Museum and Study Center reminds us why we are to never forget - and why teaching tolerance to a new generation is so important. Funds to Rockland Jewish Academy provide scholarship, while FedConnect, which we publish online every month and 4 times a year in print, helps connect us all through engaging local stories.
