The mission of Desert AIDS Project (DAP) is to enhance health and well-being. DAP has earned a national reputation as one of the most comprehensive HIV/AIDS services providers in the U.S. We are one of only a handful of AIDS agencies operating an on-site medical clinic, a full range of client support services, and a comprehensive HIV education and prevention program, including free & confidential HIV testing. Since our founding in 1984, Desert AIDS Project has grown to become the primary provider of direct medical and support services to HIV-affected men, women, and children throughout the desert region.
