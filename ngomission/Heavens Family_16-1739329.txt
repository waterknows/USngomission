Heaven's Family was founded in 2002 by David and Becky Servant to equip Christian leaders and serve the poor in the world's poorest nations. Through our Focused Funds, Heaven's Family serves poor Christians who are facing even more daunting challenges than poverty, such as persecution, hunger, unsafe water, natural disasters, widowhood, illness, orphanhood, physical handicaps, and so on. We also establish micro-banks that help enterprising believers lift themselves from poverty through small-business loans. Through our orphan care initiative, Orphan's Tear, we serve over 1,400 orphans living in more than 50 Christian orphanages in 8 nations.
