San Diego Coastkeeper protects and restores fishable, swimmable and drinkable waters in San Diego County. Originally founded in 1995 as San Diego Baykeeper, we use science, education and advocacy to empower thousands of San Diegans to be stewards of clean water and a healthy coastal ecosystem. We encourage the community to help us find water pollution and waste, so we can help fix the problem as soon as possible. We are a team of biologists, activists and lawyers working together and with the community to protect and restore fishable, swimmable and drinkable water in San Diego County.
