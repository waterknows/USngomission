Our mission is to engage and empower youth through education and outdoor experiences. All of our programmatic goals center on equipping the youth that we serve with knowledge to break the cycle of poverty and experience success as adults. Thus, our vision is to ignite infinite possibilities for Austin's youth.Currently, ASC provides opportunities for youth in Central Texas through our week-long summer camps at Zilker Park and Lake Travis. In addition, we offer more extensive support to middle-school youth in Austin ISD through our Sunshine Afterschool program, launched in the 2014-15 school year. Through the summer camps and afterschool opportunities, ASC will serve over 1,000 low-income youth in 2015.
