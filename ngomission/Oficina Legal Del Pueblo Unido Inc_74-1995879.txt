The mission of the Texas Civil Rights Project (TCRP) is to promote racial, social, and economic justice through litigation, education, and social services for low/moderate-income persons least able to defend themselves. TCRP strives to foster equality, secure justice, ensure diversity, and strengthen low/moderate-income communities in Texas. TCRP was founded in 1990 as part of Oficina Legal del Pueblo Unido, a non-profit community-based foundation located in South Texas. Since its beginning, TCRP has achieved substantial systemic gains in ensuring justice for Texans of limited means and income. TCRP uses education and litigation to make structural change in areas such as voting rights, police and border patrol misconduct, sex discrimination, employment bias, privacy, disability rights, grand jury discrimination, traditional civil liberties (i.e. free speech), and Title IX in secondary education. TCRP also conducts a program under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) and provides social and legal services to low/moderate-income victims of domestic violence.
