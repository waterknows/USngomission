Founded in 1993, Children's Restoration Network (CRN) focuses on the plight of homeless children in our community. In addition to meeting basic needs, CRN conducts special events to provide a broad range of positive experiences for the children and their mothers to promote healthy and happy community interaction. During its productive twenty year history, CRN has dedicated its efforts to fulfilling its mission and vision statements working with 134 shelters and group homes throughout metro-Atlanta, serving over 2,700 children each day, 4,400 each year. While children are our main focus, we also realize that assisting the mother is usually the best way to help the child. Programs are therefore directed towards both children and their mothers to ease their transition through homelessness. Education is CRN's main focus. We provide new book bags filled with school supplies, do one on one weekly mentoring during the school year, and award New Hope Scholarships to deserving students.
