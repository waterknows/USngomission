The Communications Consortium Media Center (CCMC) is a public interest media center dedicated to helping nonprofit organizations use media and new technologies for policy change. Our mission is to use communications strategies for policy change. Founded in 1988, CCMC seeks to influence public policy in ways that respect and support individual rights, healthy families, cultural diversity and a sustainable environment. We believe collaboration among nonprofit groups sharing policy goals is an effective and efficient way to gain credibility and to influence public policy. CCMC works to empower diverse and underrepresented communities to participate more fully in decisions about their lives.
