Tri-County Community Dental Clinic is a predominantly all-volunteer dental clinic whose mission is to provide quality oral health care services in a caring and compassionate manner to those individuals in Calumet, Outagamie, and Winnebago counties whose access to dental health care is limited due to inadequate income, or reduced access to Medicaid care.
