Founded as the School of the Ozarks in 1906, the Junior College started in 1956. The four-year program started in 1965 and was renamed College of the Ozarks in 1990. The mission of this unique institution focuses on providing a Christian education to those who are found worthy, but who are without sufficient means to obtain such training. All full-time students work rather than pay for their tuition. College of the Ozarks openly discourages debt and doesn't participate in any government loan programs. Called Hard Work U. by The Wall Street Journal, deserving students are offered the advantages of a quality, Christian education.
