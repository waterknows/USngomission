Since 1991, Cocoon House has been Snohomish County's only resource exclusively serving homeless and at-risk youth ages 13-17. We believe that every child deserves a home and the opportunity to achieve his or her fullest potential. Cocoon House provides youth housing and other critical community based services to youth, caregivers, families and the community. After sixteen years of service, Cocoon House has grown into an all-encompassing, continuum of services that strengthens families while helping teens to reclaim their youth and discover their values, strengths and talents. This enables them to face the future with stability, dignity and purpose. Our services include emergency shelter, long-term transitional housing, case management, advocacy, and prevention.
