For more than 100 years Grand Rapids Christian Schools have prepared students to be effective servants of Christ in contemporary society and provided them with distinctly Christian high-quality education. Our school environment conveys God's love and motivates students to understand and delight in God's universe, exploring old and new questions, governed by a Biblical perspective. In and outside of the classroom, what we teach and how we teach will focus on understanding our God, the breadth of creation, and how we must respond to God. Our Christian learning community is committed to excellence, where all students are challenged to develop and use their God-given potential.
