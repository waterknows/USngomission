Our mission is to help older adults remain at home as long as possible and to help them live with dignity. With concern for those who care for senior adults, we also help caregivers through services and education that will benefit them. Individuals who cannot afford to pay for services are of special concern to Senior Services and receive assistance to every extent possible through philanthropic contributions and available public funds.
