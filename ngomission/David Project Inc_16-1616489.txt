The David Project positively shapes campus opinion on Israel by educating, training, and empowering student leaders to be thoughtful, strategic and persuasive advocates. Our approach, which we call relational advocacy, emphasizes building relationships with diverse communities on campus and helping students to use their Israel experience to relate to their peers. We encourage them to get to know what is important to the student leaders they are engaging and find common ground. Then, by helping our students plan innovative programming that brings together two or more groups, we are elevating the campus conversation. More students are being reached and, often for the first time, Israel is brought into their world views. This improves both Israel's perception and the campus overall.
