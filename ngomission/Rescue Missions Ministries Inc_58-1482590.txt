The Durham Rescue Mission is a faith-based, non-profit organization. Our primary goal is to share the gospel of Jesus Christ and His redemptive work on the cross. The Durham Rescue Mission is achieving this goal as we minister to the homeless and addicted in central North Carolina. Our Mission is to meet through the power of Jesus Christ the needs of the whole person: spiritual, educational, emotional, physical, social, and vocational, so that those who are hurting may become fully functioning members of society.
