United Way of the Big Bend (formerly United Way of Leon County) was founded February 11, 1943. Over the years, United Way's purpose has remained constant. We are dedicated to supporting the greatest variety of human service agencies in the local area and reaching people from all walks of life and income groups. Our agencies address the most prominent need areas in this community: youth development, emergency services, physical health, children's services, senior services, family support, services to the disabled, community support, and substance abuse. We lead and inspire the region to work together as a community, collectively caring for one another and enhancing the quality of life for all.
