The National Coalition Against Censorship (NCAC) is an alliance of more than 50 national non-profit organizations, including literary, artistic, religious, educational, professional, labor, and civil liberties groups. NCAC's mission is to promote freedom of thought, inquiry and expression and oppose censorship in all its forms. NCAC:



educates the public and policy makers about threats to free expression,

mobilizes them to take action to oppose censorship, and assist in those efforts,

facilitates communications between local activists and national organizations,

devises new educational, advocacy, and media strategies to create a more hospitable environment for free speech and artistic freedom.

We collaborate with coalition partners to produce educational materials and events to meet the needs of their members. We promote grass roots activism by providing assistance, advice, and information to individuals and community groups around the country.
