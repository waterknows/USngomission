Founded in 1949, the League for Animal Welfare (LFAW) is a privately funded, nonprofit organization providing much-needed care for unwanted, lost and neglected cats and dogs in our community. As the oldest and one of the largest no-kill shelters in the area, LFAW serves the Greater Cincinnati area through initiatives to reduce the number of homeless animals and to help people better care for their pets. Using the resources of its dedicated staff, supporters, and volunteers, LFAW provides the medical care, behavioral training and socialization needed to match homeless animals with lifelong homes. LFAW's shelter has the capacity to care for approximately 40 dogs and 80 cats with the goal of permanent placement in loving homes. Volunteers foster additional dogs and cats and bottle feed kittens and puppies in their own homes.
