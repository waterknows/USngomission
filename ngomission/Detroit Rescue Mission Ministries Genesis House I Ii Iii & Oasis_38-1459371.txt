Founded in 1909, Detroit Rescue Mission Ministries (DRMM) is committed to sharing the gospel of the love of Jesus Christ, providing hope to the hopeless, disadvantaged, abused and homeless men, women and children of our community. By ministering to the total person - body, soul and spirit - we help them become faithful Christians, discipled into a local church, rehabilitated, employed and living productive lives in restored families. DRMM annually provides: one million meals to the hungry; more than 160,000 nights of emergency shelter; transitional housing and substance abuse treatment; transitional housing for teen moms and their children; and spiritual guidance and empowerment to more than 1,000 people daily.
