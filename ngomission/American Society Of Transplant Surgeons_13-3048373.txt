The American Society of Transplant Surgeons (ASTS) was founded in 1974 in an effort to unite surgeons involved in the field of transplantation. The ASTS and its Members are committed to leading the way in the 21st Century in fostering and advancing the practice and science of transplantation for the benefit of patients and society; guiding those who make the policy decisions that influence the practice and science of transplantation; increasing organ donation; defining and promoting training and the career-long education of transplant surgeons, scientists and physicians; and, advancing the professional development and careers of transplant surgeons, scientists and physicians.
