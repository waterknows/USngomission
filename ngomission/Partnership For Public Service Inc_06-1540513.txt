The Partnership for Public Service works to revitalize our federal government by inspiring a new generation to serve and by transforming the way government works. Building, energizing and maintaining a high-quality workforce is the key to success for any organization - and the federal government is no exception. We believe that by strengthening the civil service, we help government work better to serve the needs of all 310 million Americans. As a nonprofit, nonpartisan, mission-driven organization, we bring unique characteristics to that effort, including third-party credibility, continuity, a strong ability to convene across sectors and a passion for change.
