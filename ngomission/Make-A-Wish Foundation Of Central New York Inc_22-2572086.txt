Founded in the year 1985, The Make-A-Wish Foundation of Central New York's mission is to grant the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions to enrich the human experience with hope, strength, and joy. Fulfilling a child's wish provides a joyful and meaningful experience that benefits both the child and the family. In our chapter, we currently have approximately 300 volunteers and welcome other interested individuals. The Make-A-Wish Foundation of Central New York has granted nearly 1,400 wishes. Nationally, the Make-A-Wish Foundation has granted more than 227,000 wishes.
