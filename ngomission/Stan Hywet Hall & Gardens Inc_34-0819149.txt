Stan Hywet Hall & Gardens is a historic estate in Akron which is the former home of Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company co-founder F.A. Seiberling and his family. In 1957, the Seiberling family donated Stan Hywet to a non-profit organization so that the public could enjoy and experience it. Stan Hywet is dedicated to providing meaningful learning experiences for children of all ages, featuring youth programs that offer children unique, educational opportunities in a historic house museum atmosphere. Stan Hywet's Collections Department acquires, preserves, and provides access to rare and unique materials that document the estate, the Seiberling family, construction, and life on the estate. The department also serves as a scholarly resource for the museum's staff and volunteers as well as local, regional, national and international scholars and researchers.
