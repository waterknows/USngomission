The Richmond SPCA, founded in 1891, is a no-kill humane organization dedicated to the guiding principle that every life is precious. As a national leader in humane care and education, the Richmond SPCA is building a more compassionate community through programs of adoption, rehabilitation, spay/neuter, pet-retention, trap-neuter-return and humane education. In our most recent fiscal year we brought 3,747 orphaned pets into our care, found lifelong homes for 3,562 pets through programs of adoption, provided 3,034 homeless pets with veterinary treatment for medical conditions, spayed or neutered 5,241 animals in our on-site clinic at no or low cost, and delivered 28,749 hours of humane education and training to area school children, adults and canines.
