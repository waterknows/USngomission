Habitat for Humanity Orlando is a Christian organization dedicated to transforming the lives of low-income, hard working families through the American dream of homeownership. We are one of approximately 2,100 local affiliates of Habitat for Humanity International. Habitat Orlando's mission is to bring together families in need and volunteers of all faiths, in partnership with community resources to enhance lives by building homes, strengthening neighborhoods and improving our community.
