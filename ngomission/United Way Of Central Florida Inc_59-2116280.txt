Established in 1980 when the United Ways of Greater Lakeland, Bartow, and Winter Haven merged, United Way of Central Florida invests your charitable gifts in services that change people's lives, right here in Polk, Hardee and Highlands counties. United Way community investment volunteers focus on the distinct needs of each community we serve, carefully investing in programs that not only respond to community needs, but that also create a measurable impact. United Way of Central Florida is focused on education, income, and health. We deal with social issues collectively, leveraging investments to create solutions that bring results for our communities.
