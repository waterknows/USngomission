Founded in 1922, United Way of Central Illinois creates a better life for us by advancing the common good. Our focus is on protecting services vital to the immediate basic needs of the most vulnerable members of our community; while making long term investments in education, financial stability and health, because these are the building blocks for a good quality of life. We bring together people and organizations from all across the community who bring the passion, expertise and resources needed to get things done.
