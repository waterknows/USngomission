All Hands Volunteers is an international non-profit organization aimed at rebuilding humanity by addressing the immediate and long-term needs of communities impacted by natural disaster. Over the last ten years, we have enabled over 33,000 volunteers from 93 countries and impacted more than 100,000 families all over the world. As our volunteers work together with local residents and partners, communities are restored, hope is renewed, and lives are transformed.
