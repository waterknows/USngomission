Missoula Food Bank provides emergency food assistance to people, and strives to reduce hunger. Each year we distribute more than 500 tons of food - canned goods, fresh produce, bakery items, cereal, baby food, formula and more - to Missoula area residents. That's enough to serve roughly 1,500 households a month. Our staff and volunteers provide food to those who need it through a variety of programs and services: our free store on Third Street; the ROOTS program serving home-bound, low income seniors; Kids Table and our EmPower Pack program providing meals to children at risk of hunger during weekends and school vacations; and our satellite distribution sites in Lolo and Potomac, MT.
