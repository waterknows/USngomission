The Garden of Dreams Foundation is a non-profit organization that works with The Madison Square Garden Company to positively impact the lives of children facing obstacles. The Foundation works with 25 partner organizations throughout the tristate area, including hospitals, wish organizations and community-based organizations, to reach children who are facing challenges such as homelessness, extreme poverty, illness and foster care. Since it began in 2006, Garden of Dreams has used the magic of MSG – the Rangers, Knicks, Liberty, MSG Entertainment and MSG Networks – to brighten the lives of children and their families. In addition, through its Garden of Dreams Giving program, the Foundation helps its partner organizations meet the critical needs of the children they serve, including through direct support of scholarships and tangible, targeted community projects.
