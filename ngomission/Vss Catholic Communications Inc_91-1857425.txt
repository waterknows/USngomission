VSS Catholic Communications is dedicated to answering the call of the late Holy Father, Blessed John Paul II, for a New Evangelization. Our charism in the mission of evangelization is to broadly employ broadcast media to transmit the Gospel of Jesus Christ with the fullness of the living Tradition as preserved, revered and proclaimed by the Catholic Church for more than 2,000 years. Everyone involved recognizes this apostolate as an extraordinary gift, which we receive anew each day.
