Junior Blind of America was founded in 1953 to provide recreational services for children who were blind or visually impaired. Junior Blind of America provides a wide range of free services for infants, children, teens and adults who are blind, visually impaired or multi-disabled. Through unique programs that offer early intervention therapy, education, recreation and rehabilitation, our students learn the skills that will help them overcome challenges, maximize their potential and achieve their highest level of independence. All services are offered free of charge.
