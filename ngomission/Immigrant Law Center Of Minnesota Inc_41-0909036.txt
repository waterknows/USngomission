The Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota (ICLM) envisions a country in which immigrants are accepted and valued as full participants in the community. ICLM enhances opportunities for immigrants and refugees through legal representation for low-income individuals, and through education and advocacy with diverse communities. We bring our full legal passion, dedicated attention and highest quality service to our low-income immigrant/ refugee clients and their families. We value relationships with the communities we serve and seek to express their full potential and contributions through our work together. We believe in taking action to make immigration systems work for all.
