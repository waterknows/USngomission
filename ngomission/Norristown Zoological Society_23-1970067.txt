In 1985, the Norristown Zoological Society (NZS) assumed control of Elmwood Park Zoo. Today, Elmwood Park Zoo welcomes over 130,000 visitors annually for an educational adventure in a fun, clean, and family-oriented environment. The Zoo moves ever forward guided by its mission to foster an appreciation for wildlife and the environment that will inspire active participation in conservation. The Norristown Zoological Society operates the Zoo; the Board of Directors, composed of business and community leaders, is committed to making Elmwood Park Zoo one of the finest zoos in the world.
