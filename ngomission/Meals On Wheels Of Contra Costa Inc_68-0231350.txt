Meals on Wheels of Contra Costa Inc. supports homebound elders to maintain their health and dignity, and to live independently in the comfort and security of their own homes. We serve homebound senior citizens who have one or more chronic health conditions that prevent their preparing nutritious daily meals for themselves. We bridge the widening gap between an ever increasing number of frail homebound elders in need of Meals on Wheels in our county, and insufficient government funding for these critical services.
