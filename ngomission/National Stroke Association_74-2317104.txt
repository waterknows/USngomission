Established in 1984, National Stroke Association (NSA) has grown to be the leading resource for stroke. NSA is the only national non-profit organization in the United States devoting 100 percent of its resources to stroke through a variety of innovative and high impact programs. We provide education, services and community-based activities in prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and recovery. NSA serves people at risk, patients and their health care providers, stroke survivors, and their families and caregivers. Our awareness initiatives have provided millions of Americans with life-saving tools to prevent stroke. Our research fellowship grants provide new avenues for treatment. Through expert guidance and compassionate support, we help people realize the potential of life after stroke.
