Living on the Edge exists to help Christians live like Christians. The ministry was established in 1995 as a radio ministry of pastor and author Chip Ingram, and has since grown into an international discipleship ministry. The ministry creates Biblical teaching and tools that challenge and equip spiritually healthy Christians to become mature disciples of Jesus.
