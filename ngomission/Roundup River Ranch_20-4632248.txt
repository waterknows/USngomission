Roundup River Ranch provides children with chronic and life-threatening illnesses camp experiences with appropriate medical care that are fun, safe, and empowering. Roundup River Ranch opened its doors to the very first campers in 2011. At camp, children between the ages of seven and 17, participate in nine fully adaptable program areas. Programs are offered free of charge to campers and their families thanks to the generosity of caring supporters. Roundup River Ranch makes it possible for nearly every child, even the sickest among us, to fully enjoy the camp experience because of the advanced medical supervision provided.
