Variety the Children's Charity of Greater Philadelphia has been serving children with disabilities since 1935. Our programs and services are designed to best address the children's physical, social, medical, educational, and recreational needs without regards to economic status, race, creed, gender, or type of disability. Variety serves children between birth and 18 with temporary and/or permanent disabilities resulting from injury, illness, or congenital conditions. Variety is one of over 50 Variety chapters, called 'tents', around the world.
