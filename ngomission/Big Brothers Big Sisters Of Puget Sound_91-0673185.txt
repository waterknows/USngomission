Founded in 1957, Big Brothers Big Brothers Big Sisters of Puget Sound partners with actively involved community members to match caring adults with children, both of whom benefit from our one-to-one mentoring programs. We match children ages 7-16 with mentors in professionally supported one-to-one relationships. The mentors (called Bigs), children (called Littles), and families we serve come from all walks of life. Big Brothers Big Sisters matches these children and adults, supports their relationship, and strives to present them with opportunities to learn, grow, and explore the world together.
