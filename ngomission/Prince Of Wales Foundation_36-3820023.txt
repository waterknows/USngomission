The Prince of Wales Foundation (U.S.A.) was founded by HRH The Prince of Wales in 1997. The Foundation seeks to compliment the work of The Prince of Wales's Charitable Foundation (U.K.), and expand His Royal Highness's outreach to the United States and around the world. Since its inception, The Prince of Wales Foundation has grown to encompass an ever-broadening arena of interests and concerns. Funds raised by the Foundation support grants in the areas of education, arts and cultural programs, sustainable development in urban and rural communities and the environment.
