Greater Richmond SCAN works to prevent and treat child abuse and neglect throughout the Greater Richmond area by protecting children, promoting positive parenting, strengthening families and creating a community that values and cares for its children. SCAN was founded in 1991 to prevent and treat child abuse and neglect in the City of Richmond and the surrounding counties of Chesterfield, Colonial Heights, Hanover, Henrico, Hopewell, Louisa, Petersburg, Powhatan and Prince George. SCAN's programs provide the support, treatment, and education needed to help build safe, stable, nurturing homes for children and to lessen the negative impact family violence and trauma has on victims, families, and the community at large.
