Founded by a group of people with OCD in 1986, the mission of the International OCD Foundation (IOCDF) is to help individuals with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and related disorders to live full and productive lives. Our aim is to increase access to effective treatment, end the stigma associated with mental health issues, and foster a community for those affected by OCD and the professionals who treat them. The Foundation has grown into an international membership-based organization serving a broad community of individuals with OCD and related disorders their family members and loved ones and mental health professionals and researchers.
