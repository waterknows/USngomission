Founded in 2003, The goal of Nextbook is to enable American Jews to engage with Jewish life and culture. The intended audience is made up of two broad categories, affiliated Jews and American Jews for whom Jewish heritage remains of interest, but seemingly out of reach. Tablet is the major project of Nextbook. We want to be the Jewish Niche on the web.
