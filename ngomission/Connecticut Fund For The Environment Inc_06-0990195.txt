The mission of the Connecticut Fund for the Environment (CFE) and its program Save the Sound is to protect and improve the land, air and water of Connecticut and Long Island Sound. We use legal and scientific expertise and bring people together to achieve results that benefit our environment for current and future generations. Today, practical solutions to safeguarding Connecticut's land, air and water require many levels of expertise. Our staff of lawyers, scientists and outreach experts does the tough work of finding solutions that work. We bring those solutions to our state legislature, state agencies and the courts. CFE was founded in 1978 by Fred Krupp to protect the land, air and water of Connecticut. Save the Sound was founded in 1972 as the Long Island Sound Taskforce to preserve and protect the Sound. In 2004, CFE and Save the Sound merged, with Save the Sound incorporated as a program within CFE.
