The Santa Barbara Zoo is dedicated to the preservation, conservation, and enhancement of the natural world and its living treasures through education, research, and recreation. The Zoo is home to 160 species of mammals, reptiles, birds and insects. More than 500 animals are exhibited in open, naturalistic habitats. The Zoo participates in the Species Survival Plan (SSP), a vital cooperative conservation program comprised of Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) accredited partner zoos and aquariums. Over 200 different species are managed, aimed at maintaining genetic diversity within captive populations, sustaining these captive populations, and guarding against extinction.
