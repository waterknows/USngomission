International Child Care (ICC) is a Christian health development organization. Operating in Haiti since 1967 and in the Dominican Republic since 1988, ICC is working to change the conditions of poverty that impact health and well-being. ICC works to prevent illness amongst children and their families through immunization, oral rehydration, vitamin A distribution and clean water projects. ICC provides health education, pre- and postnatal care, reproductive health services, growth monitoring and community based rehabilitation for children with disabilities. In addition, ICC offers Tuberculosis and HIV treatment, outpatient medical clinics at Grace Children's Hospital and curative care services through our integrated community health projects.
