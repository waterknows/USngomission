Our mission is to equip people living in extreme poverty with the resources to create sustainable businesses.Our vision is a world free of extreme poverty and chronic hunger where people have the means to sustain their families.Since its inception in 1987, Village Enterprise has been developing and refining an innovative microenterprise development model for extreme poverty reduction. We use business training, seed capital grant, ongoing business mentoring, and savings groups to create small businesses. Village Enterprise's economic development model plays a unique role in the microfinance industry, providing economic opportunities in rural, agricultural areas that other organizations are not reaching, and gives ultra-poor men and women the opportunity to transform a small grant ($150) into a new business, a better standard of living, and hope for the future. Village Enterprise is headquartered in San Carlos, CA, and operates in Kenya and Uganda.
