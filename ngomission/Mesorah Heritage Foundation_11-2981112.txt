The Mesorah Heritage Foundation works to remove the language barrier and make the riches of Jewish eternity available to English-speaking Jews. To this end, the Foundation sponsors literature that celebrates the rich Jewish heritage; creates works of intensive scholarship and unexcelled beauty; and produces books that will be read, studied, and cherished for generations. In order to achieve this, the Foundation recruits accomplished translators, scholars, writers, and editors who free our great texts from the captivity of ancient languages and bring them to English-speaking Jews in books that are beautifully produced and literarily graceful. At this writing, more than a hundred scholars in America, Israel, and Europe are producing an English-language Torah literature that will endure for generations.
