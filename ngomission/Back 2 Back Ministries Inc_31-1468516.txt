Since 1997, Back2Back Ministries has been impacting the lives of children across the globe. Back2Back is an international Christian organization that is dedicated to being a voice for orphans. Through the Back2Back Child Development Model, they strive to provide holistic care to each child they serve, meeting spiritual, physical, educational, emotional and social needs that the children might overcome their life circumstances and break free from the cycle of generational poverty. Today, Back2Back provides care for today and hope for tomorrow to abandoned, orphaned and impoverished children in Mexico, Nigeria, India and Haiti.
