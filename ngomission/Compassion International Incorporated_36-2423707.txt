Compassion International is the world's leading authority in holistic child development through sponsorship. Compassion revolutionized the fight against global poverty by working exclusively with the Church to develop children out of poverty to become responsible, fulfilled Christian adults. It is the only child sponsorship program to be validated through independent, empirical research. Compassion partners with more than 6,500 Christian churches in 26 countries to release over 1.6 million babies, children and students from poverty in Jesus' name.
