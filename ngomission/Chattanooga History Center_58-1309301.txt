The Chattanooga History Center interprets the stories of our past to encourage individuals to understand how their actions shape our common future. Nearly 25 years in the making, the Chattanooga History Center began in 1978 as a grassroots effort to preserve the city's artifacts. As a progressive social history museum, the Center's compelling exhibits will combine analysis of the past with lessons for civic action. By presenting history as an experience in time—shaped by people making decisions specific to their own moment—the Chattanooga History Center will provide its visitors with tools for shaping the future of their own communities.
