TAF Academy is a 6th-12th grade STEM-focused partner school formed in partnership with public school districts that prepare students for college and careers. One of our primary goals is to enlist students as active participants in their own education. When TAF Academy students graduate, they receive a diploma that meets all Washington State and district requirements, and are academically and culturally ready for college.
