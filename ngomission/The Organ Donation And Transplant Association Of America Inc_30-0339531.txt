We are a small group of concerned individuals whose lives have been touched in one way or another by the miracles of medicine. We aren't specialists in the science behind organ and tissue donation, but we are parents, siblings, children, friends. These relationships are what motivate us to talk to others about the gift of life: the gift of saving someone's life through organ and tissue donation. By considering organ and tissue donation, discussing the realities of what we want to have our last wish be, and asking our families to respect those decisions, we can all make a difference in the life of someone waiting for an organ or tissue donation.
