Established in 1990, the Center for Economic Progress helps hard-working, low-income families move from financial uncertainty to financial security. Local in service but national in voice, we achieve our mission in three ways: we provide trusted tax and financial counseling, giving Illinois families the tools to make sound choices; we lead a national coalition of organizations that promote economic progress for low-wage workers and their families; and we advance policies and practices to create a financial system that works for all.
