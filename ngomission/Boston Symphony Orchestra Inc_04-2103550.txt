The mission of the Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO) is to foster and maintain an organization dedicated to the making of music consonant with the highest aspirations of musical art, creating performances and providing educational and training programs at the highest level of excellence. Founded in 1881, the BSO presents an average of 27 programs in nearly 100 concerts at Symphony Hall between September and April; another 33 concerts are presented each summer at Tanglewood. Education is integral to the BSO's mission, and comprises two main components: the training of young professional musicians at the Tanglewood Music Center, and in-school and summer programs that address the need for integrated, high-quality arts education in the public schools.
