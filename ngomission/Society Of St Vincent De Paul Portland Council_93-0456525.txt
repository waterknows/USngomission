Founded in 1869, The Society of St. Vincent de Paul is a worldwide Catholic organization of laypersons, open to all who wish to live their faith by loving and serving their neighbor. The mission of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul of Portland, Oregon is to provide compassion and support to individuals in need, regardless of race, origin, religion or gender. Our grass roots effort continues in serving homeless and economically disadvantaged populations in our community. We coordinate the efforts of over 50 parish conferences as well as manage special works programs including coordinating emergency services, operating a prepared and perishable food recovery program, maintaining a food bank, providing emergency rent and utility assistance, and maintaining a support structure for information, referral, and linkage in assistance to the conference volunteers.
