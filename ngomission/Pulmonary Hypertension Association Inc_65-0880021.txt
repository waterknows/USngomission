The mission of the Pulmonary Hypertension Association (PHA) is to find ways to prevent and cure pulmonary hypertension, and to provide hope for the pulmonary hypertension community through support, education, advocacy and awareness. PHA was founded in 1987 and was run exclusively by volunteers until 1999. While maintaining its grassroots culture, PHA now employs 34 staff and relies upon an extensive volunteer network to achieve its mission.



Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a rare and incurable condition that affects both genders and people of all ages, races and ethnic origins. PH is a simplified name for a complex health problem: high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs. Arterial narrowing and constriction leads to deterioration of the right side of the heart, and eventually, to heart failure. It is estimated there are approximately 30,000 diagnosed PH patients in the United States, but it is assumed that many more are living with undiagnosed PH.
