Founded in 1975, People's Resource Center (PRC) community exists to respond to basic human needs, promote dignity and justice, and create a future of hope and opportunity for the residents of DuPage County, Illinois through discovering and sharing personal and community resources. 



Today, more than 31,000 DuPage residents rely on the PRC for help each year. Most families are working, but struggle to make ends meet due to the high cost of living in DuPage County. Our programs include basic services of food, clothing and emergency assistance, as well as training programs to help people break the cycle of poverty. These empowerment programs include literacy, computer training and refurbished computers for families homes, job assistance and art enrichment. All our programs are free and many are in neighborhood sites throughout the county.
