The Association of Performing Arts Presenters develops and supports a robust performing arts presenting field and the professionals who work within it. We foster an appreciation for the performing arts among our members and their audiences; value the opportunity for members to share with and learn from one another, drawing upon their more than 50 years of collective wisdom; and believe the performing arts bridge differences among individuals, communities and cultures. The Association envisions a world where all people experience the transformative power of live performance and the performing arts presenting field is strong and vibrant - a world where performing artists are integral to all communities, where ideas circulate vigorously and freely, and where people from all cultures affirm and understand themselves and each other through the arts.
