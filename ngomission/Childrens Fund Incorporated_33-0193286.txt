Children's Fund's mission is to prevent child abuse in our community; to ensure that at-risk children who are abused, neglected, impoverished, or abandoned receive adequate food, shelter, clothing, medical care and education; and to provide equal opportunity for social development for these children. The Children's Fund was created in 1986 and is the non-profit member of the San Bernardino County's Children's Network. Children's Fund's purpose is to call to action private businesses, non-profit organizations, and concerned citizens to form a public/private partnership. This partnership provides Children's Fund an administrative overhead.
