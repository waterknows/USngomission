Established in 1935, the Animal Welfare League saves animals' lives and works to improve the way they are treated and regarded by society. The Animal Welfare League strives to: prevent cruelty to animals, provide quality homes for animals through our adoption programs, promote respect and compassion for all creatures through education, provide shelter and care for homeless and unwanted animals, reduce pet overpopulation through our low cost spay/neuter clinic, provide veterinary care for low income pet owners, and relieve the suffering of all animals. We work to improve municipal, city and state laws and regulations regarding the treatment of animals, and operate the state's largest non-profit animal shelter program.
