Black Mountain Home for Children, Youth & Families (BMH) is a safe, supportive, Christian environment for children who are dependent, neglected, abused, homeless or who otherwise cannot live with their families. BMH is affiliated with the Presbytery of Western North Carolina and the Presbyterian Church (USA). The mission of the Home is to glorify God by caring for children and families. Black Mountain Home serves children from birth through college graduation who have been abused, abandoned, or neglected. Typically, youth come to BMH when a court has decided that it is not safe or healthy for the child to remain with their family. Some may stay only a few weeks, while others may spend a considerable part of their growing up years at the Home. In FY 2010-2011 Black Mountain Home served 50 children from 11 counties.
