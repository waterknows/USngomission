The Cara Program prepares and inspires motivated individuals to break the cycles of homelessness and poverty, transform their lives, strengthen our communities, and forge paths to real and lasting success. After nearly 25 years, The Cara Program has evolved as not only a best-in-class job training and placement provider, but also a vehicle for true life transformation. Since our founding in 1991, we have placed more than 4,800 individuals into more than 6,600 quality jobs at one-year job retention rates of 70% or better, catalyzing the same number of families to stop the transfer of poverty from one generation to the next. Additionally, The Cara Program leverages a social enterprise model in which we create transitional jobs or provide access to temporary jobs in the private sector through our businesses: Cleanslate, a neighborhood beautification business, and TCP Staffing, an alternative staffing firm.
