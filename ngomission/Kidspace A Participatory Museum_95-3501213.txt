In 1979, Kidspace Children's Museum was launched to address a critical educational need in the San Gabriel Valley: increased access to the arts, humanities and sciences for children. Kidspace's mission is to enrich the lives of children through an interactive learning environment that is fun for children and families. The museum is committed to providing exhibits and programs in the arts, sciences and humanities that promote imagination, exploration and discovery. Kidspace features a variety of educational programs, world-class exhibitory, and 2.2 acres of outdoor learning gardens. At Kidspace, children can unleash an earthquake, feed giant bugs, craft art through nature and climb raindrops 40 feet into the air. In July of 2012, Kidspace opened a new 30,000 square foot expansion, The Robert and Mary Galvin Physics Forest. The Galvin Physics Forest offers 13 large scale exhibits set in a unique outdoor environment, designed to engage and interest children in the physical sciences.
