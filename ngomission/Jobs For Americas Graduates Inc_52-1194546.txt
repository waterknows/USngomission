Jobs for America's Graduates (JAG) is a state-based national organization dedicated to preventing dropouts among young people who are most at-risk. In more than three decades of operation, JAG has delivered consistent, compelling results - helping nearly three-quarters of a million young people stay in school through graduation, pursue postsecondary education and secure quality entry-level jobs leading to career advancement opportunities. The JAG National Network will make a measurable difference in the outcomes of public education and workforce development systems at the national, state and local level. We will strive to increase opportunity and reduce poverty and unemployment by fostering A Nation Without Dropouts.
