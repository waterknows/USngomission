In September of 2011, the Make-A-Wish Foundation of Metro New York joined forces with its Western New York sister chapter to form Make-A-Wish Foundation of Metro New York and Western New York. The new entity now serves 23 counties in the State of New York. The Make-A-Wish Foundation grants the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions to enrich the human experience with hope, strength and joy.
