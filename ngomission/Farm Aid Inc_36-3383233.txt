Willie Nelson, Neil Young and John Mellencamp organized the first Farm Aid concert in 1985 to raise awareness about the loss of family farms and to raise funds to keep farm families on their land. Dave Matthews joined the Farm Aid Board of Directors in 2001. Farm Aid has raised more than $39 million to promote a strong and resilient family farm system of agriculture. Farm Aid's mission is to keep family farmers on their land. Farm Aid accomplishes this mission by: promoting food from family farms, growing the good food movement, helping farmers thrive, and taking action to change the system.
