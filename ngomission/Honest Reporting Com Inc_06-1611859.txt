Established in the US in 2001, HonestReporting monitors the media, exposes cases of bias, promotes balance, and effects change through education and action to ensure Israel is represented fairly and accurately in the battle for public opinion. When media bias occurs, our worldwide base of subscribers takes action by contacting news agencies, drawing issues of bias to their attention, and requesting changes. The work of HonestReporting and MediaCentral (a project of HonestReporting) yields results. 



Since 2000, the organization prompted hundreds of apologies, retractions, and revisions from news outlets. These efforts are changing the face of the media and reporting of Israel throughout the world. As an organization dedicated to defending Israel against prejudice in the media, we aim to provide educational tools and resources to anyone wishing to advocate for Israel.
