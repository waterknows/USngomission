Founded in 1947, the Humane Society of El Paso is dedicated to preventing suffering, neglect, abuse and cruelty to animals, providing information, raising public awareness of animal issues, promoting responsible pet ownership, and kindness towards all living things. To achieve our mission, we pursue the following goals: to provide a compassionate and healthful environment for those in our care; to facilitate responsible adoption by placing animals in caring homes; to offer education and spay/neuter programs to reduce the suffering caused by pet overpopulation; to eliminate cruelty to animals through education and advocacy; and to promote responsible pet ownership and respect for all animals through education.
