Urban Ventures Leadership Foundation opened in 1993 as a faith-based, community development organization dedicated to serving the communities in South Minneapolis. The mission of Urban Ventures is to build successful community within the city by: developing youth leadership; strengthening families; and creating meaningful work opportunities. The programs of Urban Ventures serve more than 2,500 youth and adults each year. Urban Ventures' comprehensive approach to healing the community is woven into all of our programs. It is our goal to touch the head, the heart, and the hurt of each individual who walks through our doors. Our holistic efforts take the form of educational programs, empowerment groups, mentoring, and other important collaborations with community partners.
