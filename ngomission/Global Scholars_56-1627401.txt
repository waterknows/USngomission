The mission of Global Scholars is to bring glory to God and impact the world by developing godly leaders for every sector of society - government, business, home, church, the arts, law, the sciences, education - as we provide key universities and academic institutions with educational services and Christian faculty who teach and live in such a way as to draw others to faith and transformation in Christ. Global Scholars places faculty from a wide range of disciplines in teaching positions at secular universities outside North America. The vision of Global Scholars is that someday each university student in the world will have at least one professor who articulates and demonstrates the love and lordship of Jesus Christ.
