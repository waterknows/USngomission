The Museum of the African Diaspora (MoAD) showcases the history, art, and cultural richness that resulted from the migration of Africans throughout the world. By realizing our mission, MoAD connects all people through our shared African heritage. Our focus spans the African Diaspora across history, from the diaspora at the origin of human existence through the contemporary African Diaspora that has affected communities and cultures around the world. We explore four broad themes in our exhibitions and programming: Origin, Movement, Adaptation, and Transformation.
