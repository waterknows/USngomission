Founded in 1991, Jazz Aspen Snowmass (JAS) is dedicated to the presentation and preservation jazz, American and popular music through world-class festivals, performances and education programs. The original three day festival has evolved into an internationally recognized summer long series of both free and paid performances, and diverse education programs reaching gifted students, dedicated teachers and young audiences. JAS inaugurates its second decade of existence with a new winter series of concerts and in-school residency programs. Through the years since its inception, the organization has added a four day Labor Day weekend event, a free summer concert series, an all-scholarship jazz residency program for gifted young artists and a new small venue winter jazz series.
