Camp Kudzu makes life better for children and teens living with type 1 diabetes. We also help families so they can gain confidence, connections with others like them, and knowledge. Our major offerings are week-long overnight Summer Camps, Family Camps and Teen Programs. Camp Kudzu was founded in 1999, by parents, doctors, health professionals and community leaders. These caring visionaries joined forces to establish a program in Georgia that would support the special medical needs of children with type 1 diabetes (insulin-dependent, or T1D) in a fun, medically supervised environment.
