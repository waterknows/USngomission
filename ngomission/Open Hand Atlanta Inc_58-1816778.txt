Founded in 1988, Open Hand helps people prevent or better manage chronic disease through Comprehensive Nutrition Care, which combines home-delivered meals and nutrition education as a means to reinforce the connection between informed food choices and improved quality of life. Our programs and services are designed to help clients meet their personal goals and objectives for good health and to assist clients and healthcare providers in the early identification and treatment, as well as the prevention or progression of many nutrition-related illnesses. Open Hand seeks to eliminate disability and untimely death due to nutrition-sensitive chronic disease. We aim to serve our community by empowering people to live healthier, more productive lives.
