The Fund for Global Human Rights is founded on the belief that securing basic freedoms worldwide requires effective, frontline organizations challenging abuse wherever it occurs. Thus the Fund for Global Human Rights works to ensure a strong, effective human rights community worldwide. Grants are awarded through a competitive and transparent grants process in areas strategically chosen to advance human rights conditions. Our grants support campaigns that otherwise might falter for lack of resources, bring financial stability to groups, and help organizations take their work to the next level in terms of visibility and impact.
