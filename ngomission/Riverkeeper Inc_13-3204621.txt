Since 1966, Riverkeeper and its predecessor organization, the Hudson River Fishermen's Association, have been protecting the ecological integrity of the Hudson River and its tributaries, and safeguarding the drinking water supply of New York City and the lower Hudson Valley. For more than 40 years Riverkeeper has been New York's #1 clean water advocate. We have helped to establish globally recognized standards for waterway and watershed protection and serve as the model and mentor for the growing Waterkeeper movement that includes more than more than 180 Keeper programs across the country and around the globe. Riverkeeper is an independent, member-supported environmental organization founded on the premise that citizens themselves must roll up their sleeves to defend our waterways.
