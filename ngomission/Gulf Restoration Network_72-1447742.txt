The Gulf Restoration Network (GRN) is committed to uniting and empowering people to protect and restore the natural resources of the Gulf Region. The Gulf of Mexico will continue to be a natural, economic, and recreational resource that is central to the culture and heritage of five states and several nations. The people of the region will be stewards of this vital but imperiled treasure, and assume the responsibility of returning the Gulf to its previous splendor. Within this vision, we see the mission of the GRN as one of uniting and empowering people to protect and restore the resources of the Gulf Region for future generations. To this end, the GRN works to provide technical support and mentoring to grassroots groups, to connect our members to developments on national and regional issues of importance to their work, and to provide coordination, when needed, of member activities across the region.
