Founded in 1986, the Children's Organ Transplant Association (COTA) helps children and young adults who need or have had a life-saving transplant by providing fundraising assistance and family support. COTA is the premier national organization helping alleviate the financial burden of families who have transplant-needy children and young adults. For more than 26 years, COTA has worked to ensure that no child or young adult is denied a transplant or excluded from a transplant waiting list due to lack of funds. COTA has helped more than 1,900 children and adults, and has raised more than $65 million
