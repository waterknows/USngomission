The mission of the Anna Maria Island Community Center is to provide opportunities for individuals of all ages to develop character, educate minds, build healthier bodies, foster volunteerism and inspire all residents, especially our youth, to make a positive difference in our community and in the world. Services provided include youth programs such as before and after school educational enrichment programs; development programs to assist citizens who want to volunteer; and over 100 adult programs including fitness and wellness programs, art programs, dance programs, family therapy programs, and services for the elderly. The Center offers over 1.5 million hours of cultural, educational, family support, recreational and social programs annually.
