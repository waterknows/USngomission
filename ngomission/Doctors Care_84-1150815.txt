Located in Littleton, Colorado, Doctors Care helps underserved children, adults and families receive the medical attention they need. Our dedicated board, staff, and partners have served more countless uninsured or underinsured patients since 1988 and continue to watch individual lives transform because of the work we do. Doctors Care provides access to affordable health care, through a coalition of health care providers, to the medically underserved in South Metro Denver. The Doctors Care Clinic operates five days per week providing sick- and well-care visits to children and young adults age 30 and under who need to be seen onsite by a physician assistant or volunteer physician.
