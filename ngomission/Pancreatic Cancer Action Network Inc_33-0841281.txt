Founded in 1999, the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network is a nationwide network of people dedicated to working together to advance research, support patients and create hope for those affected by pancreatic cancer. The charity, which is the national organization creating hope in a comprehensive way through research, patient support, community outreach and advocacy for a cure, raises money for direct private funding of research and advocates for more aggressive federal research funding of medical breakthroughs in prevention, diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer. 

The organization is leading the way to increase the survival rate for the disease through a bold initiative-The Vision of Progress: Double the Pancreatic Cancer Survival Rate by 2020. We will achieve this goal by intensifying our efforts to heighten awareness, raise funds for comprehensive private research and advocate for more federal research funding to advance early diagnostics and better treatments.
