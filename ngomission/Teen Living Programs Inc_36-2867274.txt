Teen Living Programs (TLP) offers homeless youth a new home and a community of comprehensive support with a focus on education, vocation, counseling, health care, nutrition and life skills. We deliver comprehensive, long-term solutions to youth without homes who strive for self-sufficiency and community connection. TLP offers housing, job training, educational support, mental health counseling, holistic health care, and life skills training within a community of professional and passionate support. TLP's comprehensive, long-term approach to youth homelessness reduces the number of youth who might otherwise become homeless adults. TLP also limits youth homelessness from taking root through its outreach and prevention programs in neighborhoods and schools.
