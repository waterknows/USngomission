Founded in 1930, the Evans Scholars Foundation (ESF) provides full tuition and housing grants to deserving caddies. The fellowship was established by and named for Charles "Chick" Evans, Jr. More than 9,800 caddies, both men and women, have graduated from the program. Each year more than 840 deserving caddies attend college on tuition and housing grants from the Evans Scholars Foundation. To qualify, caddies must be nominated by their club and meet four requirements: have a strong caddie record, excellent academics, demonstrated financial need, and outstanding character. Their tuition and housing grants are renewable for up to four years, representing a value of more than $80,000 each year.
