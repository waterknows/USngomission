Founded in 2003, P.S. ARTS' mission is to improve the lives of children by providing arts education to underserved public schools and communities. P.S. ARTS is the only organization in Southern and Central California that provides yearlong arts education in dance, visual arts, music, and theater arts to every child in a school during the regular school day. Without our programs, children in these underfunded school districts would not have access to the arts. P.S. ARTS also coordinates with school administrators and parent groups to provide community outreach services designed to increase community members' capacity to advocate for educational equity and to provide critical cultural experiences for the entire family.
