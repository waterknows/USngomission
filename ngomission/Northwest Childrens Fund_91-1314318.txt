The mission of NW Children's Fund is to end the cycle of child abuse and neglect by investing in programs for at-risk children and their families, and inspiring informed philanthropy devoted to improving child welfare. We know that breaking this complicated cycle requires a multi-point strategy. Not only must we intervene when abuse or neglect has already occurred and help the fragile victims heal, we also must work to keep it from happening at all. That's why NW Children's Fund impacts several critical points in the complex cycle of abuse and neglect. By supporting therapeutic foster care, youth mentoring, family stability and so much more, we're providing the support systems children need to be in a safe, nurturing environment, and working with families to alleviate the stresses and deficiencies that can lead to abuse and neglect.
