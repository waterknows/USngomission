International Commission (IC) is an evangelistic association serving Baptist churches as a catalyst for Church to Church Partnership Evangelism. IC, an autonomous partnership evangelistic ministry, works in cooperation with Baptist Conventions to bring this world to a saving relationship with Jesus Christ. This cooperative spirit involves the Baptist leadership in the United States, the countries in which we work, and the missionaries in the field, as well as the international Mission Board.
