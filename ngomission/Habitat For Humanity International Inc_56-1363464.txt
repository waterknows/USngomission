Asheville Area Habitat for Humanity builds and preserves communities. Safe and decent housing provides families an opportunity for stability, security and personal and professional advancement. Yes, we build new houses and help preserve existing homes. But we also change lives. We have completed 266 houses. We plan to build 14 new houses this year, as well as repair/preserve another 40 existing homes in the community.
