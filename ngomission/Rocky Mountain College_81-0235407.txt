Rocky Mountain College, founded in 1947, is a community of learners working together to better understand who we are and how to live. As a liberal arts college, our responsibility is to educate ourselves and the ever-changing larger community, recognizing the importance of the liberal arts as the foundation of all learning for academic, professional and life long development. As a college founded in the Christian tradition, we seek to understand that tradition in an open and non-sectarian way, upholding the importance of one's own beliefs with respect for and fair consideration of other's beliefs. As a college in the Mountain West, we seek to understand the history and environment of our region as a bridge to understanding the history and environment of the larger world.
