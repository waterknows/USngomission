Founded in 1905, the McCallie School is an all-boys boarding and day school with approximately 900 students in grades 6-12. The McCallie School's mission is to prepare its students for college and for life. The school is dedicated to the academic, physical, spiritual, and emotional growth of boys. It seeks to inspire and motivate them: to pursue excellence and take pride in one's work and achievements; to lead lives of personal honor; to be responsible in family and personal relationships; and to manifest concern for the welfare of others. McCallie believes that its on-going Christian tradition builds a strong moral foundation and a sense of civic and social duty.
