The YWCA Knoxville is dedicated to eliminating racism, empowering women and promoting peace, justice, freedom and dignity for all. Women come to us in times of crisis, as survivors of rape or domestic violence, and for housing as they transition to a permanent living situation. We work to help them become independent by providing career counseling and support. They come for help meeting health-related goals. They come for after-school and summer programming for their children. They come for a variety of reasons. But they come. And they leave with a renewed spirit, new skills, and stronger lives.
