The Carmel Foundation is a membership organization with over 3,000 members over 55 years of age. Our vision is to facilitate successful aging by providing a broad spectrum of interactive activities and services for the ever-changing physical, social, emotional and cognitive needs of our members. The founders of The Carmel Foundation valued their community, shared a deep appreciation for the growing needs of their fellow neighbors and recognized the necessity for a friendly, homelike place to meet. The purpose, then, as now, is to provide for successful aging by ensuring seniors can remain engaged with life and maintain their independence.
