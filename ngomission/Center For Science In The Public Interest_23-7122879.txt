The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) is a consumer advocacy organization whose twin missions are to conduct innovative research and advocacy programs in health and nutrition, and to provide consumers with current, useful information about their health and well-being. Since 1971, CSPI has served as an independent and effective food industry watchdog and public health advocate. In addition to leading efforts to win passage of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, which vastly improved school foods, CSPI also helped pass the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011, which was the first overhaul of the FDA in nearly 70 years. CSPI is also credited with passing laws that require the Nutrition Facts label on packaged foods, nutrition information on chain restaurant menus, and define the term "organic." CSPI's Nutrition Action Healthletter, with nearly 1 million subscribers, is the top-rated health newsletter in North America.
