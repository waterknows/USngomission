Georgia Wildlife Federation (GWF) began as a sportsman's organization in 1936 and since then we've grown to become Georgia's oldest and largest conservation organization. Today, our members include bird watchers, hunters, anglers, educators, gardeners, hikers - a diverse group of individuals united by our concern and compassion for the environment. As an organization, GWF takes stands on issues based on ecological and wildlife principles. GWF utilizes our members' diverse interests to work together and move toward a common goal - protecting Georgia's tremendous natural beauty and diversity.
