Efrat's goal has been that no Jewish child should be lost to the Jewish People due to the economic concerns of the parents. Friends of Efrat is a group of volunteers who identify strongly with Efrat's goal and were so profoundly moved by the experience that they wanted to express their solidarity with our life-saving work on a continuous basis. A corollary of that goal is that no Jewish woman should have to go through an abortion due to financial concerns.
