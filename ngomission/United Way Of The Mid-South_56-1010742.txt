United Way of the Mid-South has served the people of our community since 1923 by generating resources to address critical health and human service needs. Every day, United Way supported programs help provide a nurturing environment for children, job skills for people who want to work, health care for seniors who might otherwise go without, food and shelter for those facing tough times, safe havens from physical and psychological abuse, therapy for those coping with special challenges and so much more. We create community solutions in the following areas: helping children and youth succeed; strengthening families and promoting self-sufficiency for individuals; enhancing the lives of adults with disabilities and seniors; maintaining our community's safety net; and building vital and safer neighborhoods.
