The mission of the Community Foundation of Greater Memphis is to strengthen our community through philanthropy. To accomplish this mission, we will: develop and effectively manage charitable funds and endowments; actively address the needs of the community by examining community issues, securing and distributing resources, advocating when appropriate, and convening meetings and conversations which encourage people to respond; and encourage philanthropy and the growth of charitable resources among individuals, families, businesses and community institutions. The Foundation was founded in 1969 by a group of business leaders and awarded some $40 million in grants last year.
