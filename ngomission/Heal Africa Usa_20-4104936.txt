Founded over a decade ago during the peak of the conflict by Congolese orthopedic surgeon Jo Lusi and his social activist wife Lyn, HEAL Africa is a direct response to these horrific conditions. HEAL Africa partners proactively with communities to transform the status of women and bring village life back into balance. Through its full-service training hospital in Goma and its community-based initiatives in public health, community development, and conflict resolution, HEAL Africa works with individuals and communities to restore health, build hope, and help create a better future for all people of the DR Congo. Today HEAL Africa has a Congolese staff of 28 doctors, 54 nurses, 340+ community development advocates and educators, a small administrative team, and hundreds of Congolese volunteers.
