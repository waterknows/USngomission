Since 1887 Vision New England, formerly known as the Evangelistic Association of New England, has been helping to develop, connect and mobilize spiritually-healthy, disciple-making Christ followers, across New England, who love God and love others. Now the largest regional association in the country, Vision New England ministry initiatives have served more than 5,000 churches in 80 denominations. As the region's leading resource for pastors and churches, Vision New England is an interdependent network of individual Christians and local churches who are committed to reaching New England through disciple-making.
