The Korean War National Museum mission seeks

  * to honor the veterans; American, South Korean and United Nations forces of that conflict;

  * to educate our citizens and future generations of the service, sacrifices and great contributions of those who fought there;

  * to preserve the legacy and history of the Korean War through exhibits, our collection, programs, and educational outreach;

  * to celebrate "the forgotten victory" as seen in the amazing growth, stability and dynamic democracy in South Korea today, guaranteed through the continued support of America's military and others since 1953.
