Habitat for Humanity of Monroe County's mission is to eliminate poverty housing by building simple, decent, affordable homes in partnership with qualifying families. Habitat homeowners pay interest-free, no-profit mortgages, which are used to build more Habitat houses. Because houses are principally built with volunteer labor, mortgage payments are affordable for low-income partners. Habitat qualifying families, or partner families, are selected based on their need for housing, ability to repay the no-interest mortgage and willingness to partner with Habitat by earning 250 hours of "sweat equity" or volunteer time. Through the work of thousands of volunteers and organizations, Habitat for Humanity of Monroe County has built more than 100 homes.
