Established in 1875, the Monadnock Humane Society (MHS) is a private humane organization dedicated to improving the quality of life for animals and people through humane education, and to providing shelter and facilitating adoption for lost, abused or abandoned animals. The MHS Adoption and Learning Center is a 23,000 square foot facility located in a secluded setting that redefines the concept of animal shelter. From the comfortable Almost Home Rooms for dogs and spacious, naturally lit feline catillions to the state-of-the-art training center and boarding facility, MHS truly does provide a caring and safe haven for thousands of animals waiting to find their forever home. MHS also offers a welcoming atmosphere for visitors and the community.
