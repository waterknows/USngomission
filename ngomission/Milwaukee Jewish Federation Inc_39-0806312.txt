The mission of the Milwaukee Jewish Federation is to ensure the continuity of the Jewish people, to enhance the quality of Jewish life and to build a strong unified Jewish community in Milwaukee, in Israel and throughout the world. In fulfilling its mission, the Federation is committed to the principles of Klal Yisrael (the collective unity of the Jewish people), tzedakah (the obligation to care for one another) and tikkun olam (improving the society in which we live). Caring for the most vulnerable is at the heart of our mission. To that end, we support vital programs and services provided by our constituent agencies to ensure that needs are met: reaching out to the elderly, to children and adults with special needs, and to those facing poverty and hunger.
