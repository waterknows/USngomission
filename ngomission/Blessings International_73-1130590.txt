Blessings International was founded in 1981 to serve as a source of pharmaceuticals, vitamins, and medical supplies for clinics and hospitals in developing nations that serve indigent populations and short-term medical teams that travel to such sites to provide donated medical services. By working through church-based ministries in developing nations throughout the world, we offer people one of their most basic needs, good health, through the provision of essential medicines and of hope for a better future. Blessings International receives donated pharmaceuticals and medical supplies and distributes them when needed in disaster areas. We also support various indigenous ministries around the world through capacity building and training. Blessings International has recently committed itself to assisting with the world-wide HIV/AIDS global crisis.
