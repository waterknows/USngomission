The Garfield Park Conservatory Alliance strengthens the community through the unique combination of the Garfield Park Conservatory Campus, other botanical resources, and the engagement of community members. With its innovative programs, the Alliance enhances the environmental, social and economic vitality of Chicago's West Side and encourages the larger community to explore the fundamental connection between plants and human life. Established in 1998, the Alliance provides educational programs, visitor services, and community programs to the conservatory.
