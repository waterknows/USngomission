Mission: To mobilize our community to create measurable results that improve people's lives.



The Spokane County United Way strategically invests in three areas - Education, Income and Health - the building blocks for a good quality life. A solid education paves the way for success in employment, which in turn leads to financial stability and a greater chance of good health. The work we do together in these areas is essential to strengthening our community and improving lives. Thanks to the generosity of individuals and businesses we invest in local community programs and services that help: 

-	Children be nurtured and safe, prepared for kindergarten and succeed in school

-	Families have basic needs met, job opportunities and financial stability;

-	People have healthy life options, access to quality care, and maximum independence.

We recruit people and organizations throughout our local community who bring the passion, expertise and resources needed to get things done. Join us.
