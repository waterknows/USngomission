Center for Creative Education reinvents education through the arts. Creative approaches are infused into classroom curriculum and after school settings, to enhance the teaching of traditional academic subjects - improving each child's learning potential and academic performance, increasing overall enthusiasm about school and shaping more productive, responsible community members that exercise creative problem solving throughout life. The Center for Creative Education uses the arts to enrich and transform a child's educational experience. We use visual, performing and language arts to enhance children's knowledge of literacy, math and science. We help bring learning to life!
