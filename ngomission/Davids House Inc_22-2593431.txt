David's House provides a home-away-from-home and support for families with children receiving treatment through Children's Hospital at Dartmouth at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H. David's House is the dream of a young boy named David Cyr, who passed away from leukemia in 1984 at the age of five. Accommodations are provided for families with ill or injured children ages 18 and under. Families of children with cancer, cystic fibrosis or spina bifida are priority guests, but other families are accommodated to the best of our ability. Our guest facilities include 15 bedrooms, nine bathrooms, four playrooms, two complete kitchens. David's House also accommodates day guests.
