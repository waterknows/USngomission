The Coast Guard Foundation is a national nonprofit organization dedicated to enhancing the lives of the men and women of the Coast Guard and their families. Founded more than 40 years ago, the Coast Guard Foundation provides education, support and relief for the brave men and women, who enforce maritime law, protect our homeland and preserve the environment. The Coast Guard Foundation aims to strengthen their service to our nation by encouraging them to excel on- and off-duty. Program support includes college scholarships for enlisted dependents and spouses, support to families of CG personnel who die or are critically injured in the line of duty, morale funding for CG units, and a robust program of recognizing and publically honoring CG heroes.
