Founded in 1976, Operation Kindness (OK) is the oldest and largest no-kill shelter in North Texas. We have saved more than 55,000 animals since our inception. We care for an average of 200-250 animals on a day-to-day basis, with another 60-80 animals in foster homes. More than 2,800 dogs and cats are adopted from Operation Kindness each year. Our mission is to provide quality care for homeless or unwanted cats and dogs in a compassionate, no-kill environment until they are adopted into responsible, loving homes, and to be a leader in our community in promoting humane values through education and awareness.
