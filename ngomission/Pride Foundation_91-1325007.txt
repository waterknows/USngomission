Pride Foundation was founded in late 1985 by four committed individuals, who believed that the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community needed its own philanthropic organization. The foundation inspires giving to expand opportunities and advance full equality for LGBTQ people across the Northwest. It envisions a world in which all LGBTQ youth, adults, and families enjoy the freedom to live safely, openly, and genuinely.
