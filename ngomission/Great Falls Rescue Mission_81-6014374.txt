Great Falls Rescue Mission is a non-profit Christian organization committed to caring for the hungry, hurting and homeless of North Central Montana. We believe lives can be changed by actively demonstrating and sharing the love of Christ and meeting a person's spiritual, physical, emotional and social needs.
