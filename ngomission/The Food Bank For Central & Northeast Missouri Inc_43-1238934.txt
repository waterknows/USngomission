Formed in 1981, The Food Bank for Central & Northeast Missouri(TFB) is a regional disaster and hunger relief network that acquires and distributes millions of pounds of donated food annually. We distribute food to people in need through a network of 135 agencies in 32 Missouri counties. TFB provides free food to soup kitchens, emergency food pantries, shelters for the abused and homeless, programs for low income children and senior citizens and rehabilitation centers. In 2010, the food bank distributed more than 27 million pounds of food and related products which helped feed more than 97,000 people per month.



The Food Bank's mission is to bring together community resources to feed people in need through empowerment, education and partnership.
