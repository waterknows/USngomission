At ICM Food & Clothing Bank (formerly known as Interfaith Cooperative Ministries), we meet the needs of more than 100 families and individuals every day, six days a week. Our mission is "providing an immediate response to basic human needs." Essential items such as food boxes (that last up to several days), clothing, toiletries, household goods are given to clients who come to ICM; a free medical clinic once a month is also provided, and screening day by day for blood pressure and other basic issues. The majority are working poor, many are elderly on fixed incomes (some raising grandchildren), and some are disabled mentally and/or physically. Some are veterans. Nobody is turned away who needs help.ICM began 31 years ago as an interfaith collaboration among local Christian and Jewish congregations, and has expanded to include many supporters of civic organizations, schools, and corporate employee groups, foundations and corporations.
