For nearly 100 years, the Renaissance Society has been at the forefront of presenting artistic innovation from around the world. What began in 1915 as a group of University of Chicago academics has grown into an internationally acclaimed platform for risk-taking, boundary-pushing contemporary art. The original intentions of the Renaissance Society still ring true: to present art that engages with key questions of our times, to support ambitious artistic experimentation, and to provide a rich interdisciplinary context for discovering and discussing contemporary art. An independent, non-collecting museum, we are committed to supporting artists and to engaging audiences with their work.Today we maintain this commitment to advancing artistic expression and intellectual inquiry. Under Executive Director Solveig, the institution is reasserting itself as a uniquely rigorous platform for developing the artwork that will define the art of tomorrow.
