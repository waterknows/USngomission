More than 80 years ago, concerned and compassionate citizens created United Way of Central Ohio to help people in need and make our community a better place for everyone. Today, we are mobilizing the caring power of thousands of individuals and central Ohio employers to advance the common good. Together, we are working to create opportunities for a better life for all. We are focusing the collective resources of our community on the building blocks for a better life: a quality education that leads to a productive career, enough income to support a family through retirement, good health and a safe place to live.
