Founded in 1984, Global Volunteers strives to wage peace throughout the world by helping to establish mutual understanding between people of diverse cultures. Global Volunteers is a NGO (non-governmental organization) in special consultative status with the United Nations. Global Volunteers builds bridges of understanding between people of diverse cultures by involving them in one-on-one service projects. The function of servant-learner volunteers is to serve local people by sharing their talents with them. Projects include tutoring children, teaching conversational English or business skills, renovating and painting community buildings, assisting in health care or with natural resource projects, and nurturing at-risk kids.
