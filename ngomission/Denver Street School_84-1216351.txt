Founded in 1985 by Tom Tillapaugh, The Denver Street School (DSS) is a Christian alternative high school primarily serving the troubled and at-risk youth of the Denver metropolitan area. DSS offers struggling students a second chance to earn a high school diploma through a fully accredited program in a small classroom setting. We believe that a quality education is the most effective approach to transforming many underprivileged members of our society into productive citizens, and serves the population of students in Metro Denver that have struggled with, dropped-out or been expelled from the public school system, helping them toward self-sufficiency through education.
