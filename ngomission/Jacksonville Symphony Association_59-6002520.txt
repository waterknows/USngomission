Founded in 1949, The Jacksonville Symphony Orchestra (JSO) is one of Florida's most long-standing orchestras. As one of a handful of American orchestras with its own dedicated concert hall, the JSO performs the majority of its programs in the Robert E. Jacoby Symphony Hall, the only true orchestra concert hall in Florida. The JSO also reaches nearly 250,000 residents on the First Coast and throughout Florida. Nearly half of these residents are children, who benefit from the Symphony's extensive education programs, including concerts, ensemble performances and master classes, a school partnership program - Symphony Schools - and the Jacksonville Symphony Youth Orchestra. In addition to a season schedule of approximately 130 concerts, Symphony musicians give nearly 200 educational ensemble performances in schools and senior centers.
