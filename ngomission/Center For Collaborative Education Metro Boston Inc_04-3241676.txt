The mission of the Center for Collaborative Education (CCE) is to transform schools to ensure that all students succeed. We believe that schools should prepare every student to achieve academically and make a positive contribution to a democratic society. To achieve its vision of a world where every student is college- and career-ready and prepared to become a compassionate, contributing global citizen, CCE works at the school, district and state levels in New England. CCE partners with public schools and districts to create and sustain effective and equitable schools. CCE seeks to influence the larger public's view on education to better support change that fosters democratic and equitable schools.
