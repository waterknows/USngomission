Founded in 1892 by a group of Christian businessmen, the Union Mission Ministries has served as a beacon of light to needy people for over 100 years. From its humble beginnings as a small shelter in downtown Norfolk, Virginia, to its present status as the capstone of nine different vital ministries in Norfolk and Virginia Beach, the Mission has remained true to its original purpose: to aid the poor and needy; to reform the erring; to help those that are out of the way; to feed the hungry; to shelter the homeless; to preach the gospel; and to rescue the perishing.
