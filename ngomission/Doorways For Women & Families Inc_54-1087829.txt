Founded in 1978, Doorways for Women and Families strives to end homelessness and family and intimate partner violence by offering safe shelter and housing, life-changing support services, and community advocacy. We operate a domestic violence hotline and provide 24/7 shelter and housing through a Domestic Violence Safehouse (11 beds), Family Home (21 beds), and HomeStart Supportive Housing Program serving 20 households at a time. We also provide support and advocacy, financial literacy counseling, children's services and a range of essential life skills promoting healthy, vibrant living. We serve more than 1,400 people per year, and more than half of the people in our housing programs are children.
