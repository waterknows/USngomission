Founded in 1983, the Charcot-Marie-Tooth Association's (CMTA) goals are patient support, public education, promotion of research and ultimately the treatment and cure of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT). CMT is the most commonly inherited neurological disorder and is found world-wide in all races and ethnic groups. CMT patients slowly lose normal use of their feet/legs and hands/arms as nerves to the extremities degenerate and the muscles in the extremities become weakened because of the loss of stimulation by the affected nerves. Our mission is to generate the resources to find a cure, to create awareness, and to improve the quality of life for those affected by Charcot-Marie-Tooth.
