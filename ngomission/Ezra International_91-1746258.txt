Ezra International is a Christian non-profit organization that helps Jewish people make aliyah (emigrate to Israel).

We accomplish this by providing one-on-one support for Jewish people in their home countries; completing in-depth ancestry research; and by procuring necessary immigration documents and financing the emigration journey.
