Bend the Arc strives to connect Jews who want to make a difference with the tools they need to do so, working collaboratively across lines of race and faith with people and communities throughout the United States to create economic opportunity and secure basic rights for all Americans. We envision a thriving, collaborative national movement working in communities around the nation to ensure that everyone in America has true economic opportunity and can enjoy the same basic rights -- a safe place to live, a job that lets them provide for their families and hold their heads high, an accessible ladder of opportunity, and freedom from fear, hate and want.We take pride in the American Jewish legacy of speaking out against injustice and iniquity, and in the work we are doing to build a justice movement that proudly embraces this legacy.Bend the Arc formed when Progressive Jewish Alliance and Jewish Funds for Justice merged in 2011.
