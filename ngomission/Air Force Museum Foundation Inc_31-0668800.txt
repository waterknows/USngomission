The Air Force Museum Foundation was chartered in 1960 to assist the National Museum of the United States Air Force as a medium of informing and educating the public on the important role of the United States Air Force in our nation's defense. We serve as a philanthropic corporation in assisting in the development and expansion of the facilities of the National Museum. In addition, the Foundation provides limited funds each year to the Museum for special projects and underwrites several program activities such as education, volunteer support, special events and promotional efforts. The National Museum of the United States Air Force is the largest and oldest military aviation museum in the world. Each year over one million visitors from around the world tour 10 acres of indoor exhibits, featuring over 400 aircraft and missiles and thousands of artifacts.
