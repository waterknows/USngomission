Founded in 1981, the Roever Evangelistic Association is committed to seeing the youth of America and their families come to saving faith in Jesus Christ and to be assimilated into the local church, using every means possible, but primarily through proclamation evangelism. It is the vision of Roever Evangelistic Association to present the Gospel of Jesus Christ to everyone possible, with primary focus on the youth and families of America. Since its inception, Roever Evangelistic Association has successfully reached audiences through such venues as interdenominational evangelistic rallies, school assemblies, business, men's & youth conventions, and media presentations. Additionally, printed publications as well as video and audio materials play a vital role in fulfilling the Association's mission.
