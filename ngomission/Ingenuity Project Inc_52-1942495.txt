The mission of the Ingenuity Project is to prepare highly capable and motivated Baltimore students to achieve at nationally competitive levels in mathematics and science. The goal is to give city students the classroom advantages that wealthier county and private schools offer their populations with the expectation that Ingenuity students will take advanced placement courses in high school, attend college, and ultimately be prepared to become leaders in their chosen professions.
