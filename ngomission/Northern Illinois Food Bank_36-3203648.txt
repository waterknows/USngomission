The mission of Northern Illinois Food Bank is to lead the northern Illinois community in solving hunger by providing nutritious meals to those in need through innovative programs and partnerships. We collaborate with 800 network partner food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters, schools and other organizations in the following 13 counties - Boone, DuPage, DeKalb, Grundy, Kane, Kankakee, Kendall, Lake, McHenry, Ogle, Stephenson, Will, and Winnebago, where one in ten of our neighbors are at risk of hunger. In FY 2013 we provided more than 42 million meals to serve over 60,000 different people each week. Northern Illinois Food Bank has centers in Geneva (West Suburban Center), Park City (North Suburban Center) and Loves Park (Northwest Center), and an office in Joliet (South Suburban Office).
