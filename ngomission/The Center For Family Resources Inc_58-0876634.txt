It was the vision of our founders that The Center for Family Resources (CFR) would be a premier place with the best people and programs for strengthening individuals, families, and communities so that they could acquire the resources they need to become independent and self-sufficient, thereby breaking the cycle of poverty. Since 1960, CFR has helped thousands of low-income families with employment, education, and housing services; leadership development programs; mentoring opportunities; and temporary financial and food assistance. CFR carries out its mission by providing temporary financial assistance to stabilize families in crisis; housing for low-income and homeless families in a safe and secure environment; and education and training to individuals and communities to increase economic capacity and personal growth.
