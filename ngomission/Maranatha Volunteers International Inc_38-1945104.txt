Maranatha Volunteers International, founded in 1969, is a Christian organization, which organizes and implements the construction of urgently needed buildings all over the world. More than 60,000 people have volunteered for Maranatha projects in 63 countries. The impact of Maranatha's mission is two-fold as we provide desperately needed buildings, but also offer opportunities for ordinary people to make service a part of their lives.
