Established in 1966, Volunteer Lawyers Network (VLN) provides free civil legal services to low-income persons through volunteer attorneys. In short, VLN engages the vast human resources of the private bar in addressing some of the most pressing legal issues facing struggling individuals and families in our community. Our volunteer attorneys preserve and protect the rights of the most vulnerable among us.
