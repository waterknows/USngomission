Established in 1916, the Hawaii Community Foundation (HCF) is one of the oldest community foundations in the United States. The HCF is a public, statewide, charitable services and grant making organization supported by donor contributions for the benefit of Hawaii's people. HCF helps people make a difference by inspiring the spirit of giving and by investing in people and solutions to benefit every island community. HCF ranks among the top 40 largest community foundations out of 600 across the nation, and we distribute more than $30 million in grants each year.
