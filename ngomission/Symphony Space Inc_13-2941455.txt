Symphony Space fosters artistically and culturally diverse performing arts, literary, and film programs that bring artists and audiences together in an atmosphere of exploration and intimacy. Reaching audiences throughout New York City, the wider metropolitan area, and - through distribution of programs via media such as radio, recordings, pod casts and touring - the nation, we: present and produce a calendar of innovative, multidisciplinary arts events; provide a first-rate affordable facility for artists and producers; nurture relationships with established and emerging artists and other cultural organizations who will use Symphony Space as a venue for adventurous artistic growth; and take a position of leadership in curriculum-based arts education for children and adults.
