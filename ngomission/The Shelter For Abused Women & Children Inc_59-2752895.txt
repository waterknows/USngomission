The Shelter for Abused Women & Children works to help adult and child victims and survivors of domestic violence through safety, intervention, and support; to educate the public about domestic violence; and to advocate for social change against domestic violence. Services provided by the Shelter include 24 hour crisis counseling, an emergency safe shelter, a counseling center, a transitional living program, support groups, children's services, direct assistance, and court and legal services. The Shelter's vision is a community without domestic violence so that every home is a safe haven for the family it shelters.
