Since 1968, Sociedad Latina has worked in partnership with Latino youth and families to end destructive cycles of poverty, health inequities, and lack of educational and professional opportunities in our community. Through our Pathways to Success model we pioneer new and innovative solutions to the most pressing issues facing Latino youth today, supporting positive youth development from age 10-21, creating a community that supports young people, and training all youth to advocate for themselves and their communities.
