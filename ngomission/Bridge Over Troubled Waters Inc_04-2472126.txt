Bridge Over Troubled Waters (Bridge) is Boston's premier organization dedicated to transforming the lives of runaway, homeless, and high-risk youth through safe, supportive, and encouraging relationships and effective and innovative services that guide them toward self-sufficiency. Bridge began in 1970 with a small but energetic group of staff and volunteers, who offered free and confidential services to homeless young people on the streets of Boston. Of the young people who seek help at Bridge, 100 percent live at the poverty level. Bridge offers a safe and supportive environment in which these troubled youth can find out who they are and where they want to be. Then we help them get there.
