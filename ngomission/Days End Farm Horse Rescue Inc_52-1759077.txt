Days End Farm Horse Rescue (Days End) is a volunteer-based, animal welfare organization established in 1989 to ensure quality care and treatment of horses through intervention, education and outreach. Since its beginning in 1989, DEFHR has been a place where children and adults have found enrichment, satisfaction, sadness and purpose through helping to provide care for unwanted, abused or neglected horses. DEFHR has gone from a small non-profit sheltering only a few horses annually, to a full-scale and well-respected rescue and rehabilitation facility housing on average 60 to 90 horses at any given point in time.
