Established in 1965, Roundabout Theatre Company is committed to producing the highest quality theatre with the finest artists, to sharing stories that endure, and to being accessible and affordable to all audiences. Roundabout operates the American Airlines Theatre, Studio 54, the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theatre/ Laura Pels Theatre, and the Stephen Sondheim Theatre. On each of Roundabout's five stages, the thrill of theatre comes to life through classic plays, timeless musicals and new works by emerging and established playwrights. Through our educational initiatives, Roundabout strives to use theatre to enhance teacher practice and deepen student learning.
