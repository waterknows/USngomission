Greater Boston Legal Services' (GBLS) mission is to help poor families and individuals secure some of the most basic necessities of life that have illegally or inappropriately been denied. Clients include: families seeking benefits to avoid destitution; women and children seeking protection against abuse; homeless families seeking emergency shelter and permanent affordable housing; low-income tenants facing inappropriate eviction; elders and people with disabilities seeking inappropriately denied income support and medical benefits; and victims of torture seeking asylum in the U.S. In addition to representing individuals and families, GBLS engages in systemic advocacy to bring about positive change for the poor. GBLS also represents community groups and provides community legal education.  Advocates provide advice and represent people in court, before agencies, and before city councils and the state legislature. In 2010, GBLS provided legal assistance to more than 15,000 clients.
