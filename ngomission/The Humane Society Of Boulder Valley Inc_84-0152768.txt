It is the mission of the Humane Society of Boulder Valley to protect and enhance the lives of companion animals by promoting healthy relationships between pets and people. We stay true to our mission statement through a diverse curriculum of programs and services. Over a century ago, the Humane Society of Boulder Valley was founded to protect those who did not have a voice to protect themselves. This mission holds true today as we counter animal neglect and cruelty by partnering with community animal care and control and law enforcement agencies. We offer refuge to over 8,000 animals each year.
