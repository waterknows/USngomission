Founded in 1922, the Animal Protective Association of Missouri (APA) is dedicated to bringing people and pets together, advancing humane education and creating programs beneficial to the human/animal bond. Through the support of the community, the APA is able to provide the following services: shelter and care for homeless dogs and cats; adoption services; veterinary clinic; lost and found assistance; and education and outreach. We take in over 4,000 animals annually. Our daily numbers vary due to the season. On some days, in the summer, we take in over 100 animals in a day. We can house about 350 animals at a time.
