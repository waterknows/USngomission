Heart for Africa is a faith-based non-profit 501(c)3 public charity. Working alongside churches in Swaziland, we are providing care and hope for a future for children in this small African nation. Through short term service trips, child sponsorship, and large fund raising programs, we are working to deliver quality care, shelter, food, water, clothing, health care, and education to the orphaned and vulnerable children of Swaziland.Heart for Africa is developing a place of hope in Swaziland called Project Canaan. Project Canaan is a 2,500 acre large-scale land development project being designed by business people to come alongside Africans and bring expertise, resources and hearts together to find a holistic solution to a complex set of issues. It is providing training and employment, growing large amounts of food to stimulate the local economy and allowing for export while supporting orphans and vulnerable children on the property and across the nation.
