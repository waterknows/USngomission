Ebenezer Christian Children's Home serves as a loving and nurturing home to displaced children from Wilkes and surrounding counties. We made it our mission to provide a loving and caring Christian environment to those children in need. We have been serving children ages three through twenty-one since 1994, and have strived to provide the most basic human needs, love and acceptance, to those who God has placed here.
