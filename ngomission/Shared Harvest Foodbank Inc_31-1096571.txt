The primary purpose of Shared Harvest Foodbank (SHF) is to alleviate poverty and hunger by soliciting and judiciously distributing surplus marketable and wholesome grocery products to a network of charitable food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters and other distributing organizations, which in turn distribute these products to needy and hungry people. SHF develops, monitors, strengthens, and otherwise supports this network of charities by fostering communication, setting standards for distribution and storage, and disseminating educational materials appropriate to our collective mission of helping people in poverty. SHF educates the public and private sector, and the community in general, about the nature and solutions to the problems of hunger and poverty.
