The mission of 4 Paws for Ability is to: enrich the lives of people with disabilities by the training and placement of service dogs to provide individuals with companionship and promote independent living; educate the public to accept the use of service dogs in public places; and assist with animal rescue whenever possible by obtaining many of our animals from shelters and rescue groups. Funding of a 4 Paws' service dog is the responsibility of the applicant. Applicants typically use fund-raising activities to gather these funds, and 4 Paws assists the applicant as necessary. 4 Paws provides a wide range of funding options, and has no eligibility requirements beyond a physician statement that the person requesting a service dog has a disability as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.
