Tree House Humane Society is a humane organization that promotes the inherent value of every animal and strives to educate the public about proper and responsible animal care, with a focus on the care and placement of stray cats with special physical and emotional needs. Founded in 1971 and incorporated in 1975, Tree House is the largest cageless, no-kill shelter for injured, sick and abandoned cats in the Chicagoland area. Since its founding Tree House has found homes for more than 14,000 residents. Tree House provides a safe haven for feral, stray, abused, neglected, and/or critically injured felines. Additionally, we performed over 500 spays and neuters.
