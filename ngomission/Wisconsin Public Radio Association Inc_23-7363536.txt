The Wisconsin Public Radio Association (WPRA) is a forward-looking organization dedicated to facilitating radio programming of high quality that addresses the needs of listeners. This year, the WPRA members will contribute approximately $5.45 million to improve and keep WPR on the air all over Wisconsin. WPRA serves as a statewide membership organization for those listeners of WPR who have contributed at a minimum membership level; engages in fundraising to support the program service of WPR; sponsors projects that involve public participation throughout WPR's listener area; and through public awareness activities, promotes the service so as to attract additional member support.
