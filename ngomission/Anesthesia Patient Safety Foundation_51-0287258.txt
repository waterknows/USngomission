The Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation's (APSF) mission is to improve continually the safety of patients during anesthesia care by encouraging and conducting safety research and education, patient safety programs and campaigns, and national and international exchange of information and ideas. The APSF persists in pursuit of its mission of zero tolerance for injury to patients. It serves as a model for the pioneering collaboration and commitment of the entire constellation of anesthesia-related professions to the common goal of patient safety.
