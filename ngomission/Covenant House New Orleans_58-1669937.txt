For over 25 years (1987), Covenant House New Orleans has provided a safe haven for homeless, runaway and at-risk youth ages 16 - 21. We shelter neglected and abused kids from New Orleans and from across the country. In the past year our average daily census has increased from 45 youth to over a 100 youth a night. Knowing the dangers of the street, we will turn no child away. Since opening our doors we have touched the lives of over 18,000 kids. In addition to food, clothing and shelter, we also provide medical attention, individual and family counseling, educational assistance, vocational and job training, life skills, and short and long term housing."We who recognize God's providence and fidelity to His people are dedicated to living out His covenant among ourselves and those children we serve, with absolute respect and unconditional love." As a private non- profit, we are dependent on charitable donations for 80% of our funding.
