Family Eldercare was founded in 1982 by a group of professionals concerned with supporting the family's role as caregiver for frail elders through training and information. The agency soon expanded to include services to prevent abuse, neglect and financial exploitation of elders and adults with disabilities. We want to ensure that all older adults receive the care they need to remain independent and living in the comfort of their own homes for as long as possible. We support caregivers with services and education that allow them the opportunity to have balance in their lives and to maintain good health.
