Founded in 1991, National Breast Cancer Foundation (NBCF) extends women's lives through education about breast cancer and early detection. The organization provides hope to women and families affected by breast cancer through a community of caring support and encouragement that enables those diagnosed with breast cancer to have fulfilling lives during their treatment and afterward. The Foundation exists to save lives by providing access to free and low-cost mammograms for those with limited resources, increased awareness through continuing education programs and online community support programs.
