The New Jersey Performing Arts Center (NJPAC) has garnered national attention in its first nine seasons, serving as a model for programming, audience diversity, education initiatives, and the catalytic role it has played in returning nightlife and economic activity to NJ's largest urban community. A major component of NJPAC's mission is to develop into a world-class cultural complex, showcasing the best artists of national and international acclaim. Since the grand opening, NJPAC has welcomed renowned artists, cultural icons, and some of the world's most cherished orchestral, dance, theater, and instrumental works, as well as the best performers from New Jersey's outstanding array of artists and companies. NJPAC has attracted over five million patrons (including 900,000 children) since its October 18, 1997 opening night.
