Founded in 1990, Book-It Repertory Theatre is dedicated to transforming great literature into great theatre through simple and sensitive production and to inspiring its audiences to read. Book-It creates world-premiere adaptations of classic and contemporary literature for the stage, preserving the narrative text as it is spoken, not by a single "narrator" but as dialogue by the characters in the production. Performing books instead of plays allows the Book-It theatre experience to spark the audience's interest in reading and to challenge the audience to participate by using their imaginations.
