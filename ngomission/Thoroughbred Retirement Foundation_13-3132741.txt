Founded in 1982, the Thoroughbred Retirement Foundation (TRF) works to save thoroughbred horses no longer able to compete on the racetrack from possible neglect, abuse and slaughter. The TRF is the world's largest, best known and most respected charitable organization devoted to equine rescue. The TRF is a place of hope and renewal. It is a place for thoroughbreds to go when their racing days are behind them, a place where they will be safe, healthy and well cared for. It is a place that offers a humane alternative to the dire possibilities that have long faced a great majority of ex-racers - neglect, abuse and slaughter. It is a place, built on love and caring, that is befitting such noble and deserving animals.
