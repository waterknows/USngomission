On The Rise's mission is to support the initiative and strength of women living in crisis or homelessness. In a physically and psychologically safe environment, we build the relationships and provide the tools that each woman needs to rise to her potential. On The Rise annually reaches and assists nearly 300 of the most highly marginalized and socially isolated women. We use a relational model designed to offer respect, dignity, connection, information, guidance and hope to women who have fallen through the cracks of our social service system. We meet each woman where she is, help her build on her strengths, and partner with her on her journey from surviving, to living, to thriving.
