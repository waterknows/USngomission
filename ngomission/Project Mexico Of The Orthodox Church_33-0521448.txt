Since 1988, Project Mexico has been involving young people in the alleviation of suffering by building homes for Mexico's poor. In 1996 our outreach expanded through the opening of St. Innocent Orthodox Orphanage in Tijuana which provides a home for teenaged boys who live on the streets or who have been put out of other orphanages and would otherwise be left to fend for themselves. St. Innocent Orphanage is the only facility dedicated to teenaged boys in Tijuana and one of only four in the entire country of Mexico. We now stand at well over one hundred homes built and blessed. Over 6,900 volunteers from forty-three of fifty states and eleven foreign countries have come to give of themselves and have been blessed in return.
