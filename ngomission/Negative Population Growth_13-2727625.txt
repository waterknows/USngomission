Negative Population Growth (NPG) is a national membership organization founded in 1972 to educate the American public and political leaders about the detrimental effects of overpopulation on our environment, resources, and quality of life. NPG advocates a smaller and truly sustainable population accomplished through smaller families and lower, more traditional immigration levels. NPG is a leader in the movement for a sound population policy that recognizes the crucial linkages between population growth, environmental degradation, and a declining quality of life. NPG produces informational publications, advocates to shape public policy, shapes public opinion through media campaigns, and spreads information through education and outreach.
