Founded in 1995, Winning At Home encourages people at all ages and stages of family development to lead Christ-centered homes. We seek to do this through radio programming, conference speaking, books, and other multi-media resources-all designed to offer hope and renewal to individual lives. Winning At Home comprises a staff of people who produce resources, host special events, and offer help and support for marriages and families. Although the organization has changed significantly since its beginnings, our vision remains the same: helping families "win at home".
