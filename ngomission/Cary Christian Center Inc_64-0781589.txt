The mission of Cary Christian Center (CCC) is to actively proclaim and demonstrate the Gospel of Jesus Christ in order to enable individuals to attain their full potential in Christ. We believe God has called us to break the cycle of poverty in the lives of those we serve. Poverty is a destructive lifestyle that sets limits and boundaries on an individual that prevents that individual from reaching their full potential. To break the cycle of poverty, we must build relationships that are based on biblical principles. We build relationships with individuals through the various ministries by becoming involved in their lifestyles which ultimately lead them to making healthy choices. CCC began as a clinic in 1971 and eventually became a ministry with a broad range of services.
