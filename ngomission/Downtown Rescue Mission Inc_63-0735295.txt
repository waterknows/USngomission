The Downtown Rescue Mission, an Alabama organization, is a place of refuge - offering different charities for the homeless of our community. Whether it is a man, a woman or a child, they can find a warm meal and a safe place to stay in one of our homeless missions. Since 1975, the less fortunate have been coming through our doors and finding help and hope for their problems. The Men's Ministry has been a part of the Mission since its inception. The Men's Dormitory can hold from 150 to 170 program and transient men and is used for a variety of ministries. The Women's and Children's Shelter provides food, clothing, shelter and education to women and children in need for both long and short-term care. There is also a separate apartment for families in need whether it is a man with young children or a mom with teenage boys.
