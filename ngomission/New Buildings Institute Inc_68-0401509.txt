New Buildings Institute is working to improve the energy performance of commercial buildings. We work collaboratively with commercial building market players- governments, utilities, energy efficiency Columbia Gorge advocates and building professionals- to remove barriers to energy efficiency, including promoting advanced design practices, improved technologies, public policies and programs that improve energy efficiency. We also develop and offer guidance to individuals and organizations on designing and constructing energy-efficient buildings through our Advanced Buildings suite of tools and resources.
