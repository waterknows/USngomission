Founded in 1970, the mission of the Discovery Eye Foundation (DEF) exists to facilitate the development of cures and improve patient care through retinal and corneal research and educational programs for eye disease. We accomplish this through the funding of ground-breaking retinal and corneal research and through the development of multi-national outreach and support programs for those who are afflicted with eye disease. Through the establishment of the National Keratoconus Foundation and the Macular Degeneration Partnership, DEF has worked to provide the public with up-to-the-minute, unbiased information on keratoconus and age- related macular degeneration. DEF outreach programs provide information in a variety of formats including websites, free publications, regular newsletters, support groups and telephone access to healthcare professionals.
