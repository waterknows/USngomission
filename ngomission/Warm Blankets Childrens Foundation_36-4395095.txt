Kinship United is dedicated to the rescue of orphans and widows through third world church planting and orphan outreach. Kinship United offers a fresh, dynamic approach to confront the world orphan crisis, through establishing and supporting church-based Family Homes. Every home shares a building with the local Christian church. The orphan children live on the top level with the caregivers, while the ground level is where the church and community meet. The homes provide beneficial, nurturing, holistic care to parentless infants, children, and adolescents.Kinship United operates homes in Kenya, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Thailand and Uganda.
