The United Mitochondrial Disease Foundation (UMDF) was founded in 1996 through a merger of several smaller foundations established by those who lost loved ones to the disease. Mitochondria are responsible for producing 90% of the energy needed by our body to sustain life. Mitochondrial diseases result when there is a defect that reduces the ability of the mitochondria to produce energy. The UMDF offers support to all sufferers of mitochondrial disorders regardless of diagnosis, suspected or confirmed. Our mission is to promote research and education for the diagnosis, treatment and cure of mitochondrial disorders and to provide support to affected individuals and families. Since 1996, the UMDF has provided more than $7 million in grants to support the research that may lead to a less invasive diagnosis and ultimately a cure.
