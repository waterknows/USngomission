Bridging, serving the greater Twin Cities, is the largest furniture bank in North America. Providing furniture and household goods to families and individuals transitioning out of homelessness and poverty, Bridging gives hope–and for many–a leap toward financial stability for the first time. With locations in Bloomington and Roseville, Bridging is driven by volunteers and donations of furniture and household goods from the community. Since 1987, Bridging has furnished over 60,000 homes, and every year, reduces landfill space by 7 to 10 million pounds.
