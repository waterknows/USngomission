Friends of Women's World Banking (FWWB) raises donations from U.S. foundations, corporations and individuals in support of Women's World Banking global mission. Women's World Banking is the global non-profit devoted to giving more low-income women access to the financial tools and resources essential to their security and prosperity. For more than 35 years we have worked with financial institutions to show them the benefit of investing in women as clients, and as leaders. We equip these institutions to meet women's needs through authoritative market research, leadership training, sustainable financial products and consumer education. Headquartered in New York, Women's World Banking works with 34 institutions in 32 countries with a reach of 14 million women to create access to finance on a greater scale than ever before.
