Founded in 2003, Great Plans SPCA works to save, protect, and improve the lives of animals, while strengthening the relationship between pets and their human companions. We are the Kansas City Metro's most unique and comprehensive No Kill animal welfare organization, serving more than 35,000 needy pets annually - more than any other agency in the area. We proudly report a live-release rate of 96% or higher. We offer a lifelong, full-circle approach for pets and their human companions with our three-pronged approach: prevention, adoption, retention.
