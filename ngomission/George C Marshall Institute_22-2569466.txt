Founded in 1984, the George C. Marshall Institute (GMI) improve the use of science in making public policy about important issues for which science and technology are major considerations. Our current program emphasizes issues in national security and the environment. The Institute's accurate and impartial analyses are designed to help policy makers distinguish between opinion and scientific fact so that decisions on public policy issues can be based on solid, factual information, rather than opinion or unproven hypotheses. GMI carries out its mission through published reports, roundtables, workshops and collaboration with institutions that share our interest in basing public policy on scientific facts.
