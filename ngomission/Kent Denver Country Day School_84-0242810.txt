Kent Denver School continues the proud traditions of the Kent School for Girls, founded in 1922, and the Denver Country Day School, founded for boys in 1953. The schools united in 1974 to form Kent Denver School. Excellence in scholarship and character is the goal of a Kent Denver education. We seek to build a caring, diverse community of responsible citizens. To that end, the school provides a challenging college preparatory curriculum and sets high ethical standards. There are 659 students at Kent Denver, 222 in the middle school and 437 in the upper school. The school has 78 full- and part-time faculty, 51 of whom have advanced degrees.
