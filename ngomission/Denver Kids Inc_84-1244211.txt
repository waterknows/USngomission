Denver Kids, Inc. exists to support Denver Public Schools (DPS) students, grades K-12, who face the personal challenges of higher risk environments, to successfully complete high school, pursue a post-secondary option, and become contributing members of the community. The Denver Kids, Inc. educational counselors are the core of our program. Averaging caseloads of 55 students, our educational counselors provide the one-on-one support and advocacy necessary to empower our Denver Kids, Inc. students to succeed academically, personally, and socially. Stationed at our main office at 1330 Fox Street and five satellite offices throughout DPS, the educational counselors interact with school personnel, families, mentors, and various community members and agencies to provide support for their students to help them reach their full potential.
