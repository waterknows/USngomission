Since its founding in 1949 by Dr. Jacob Gartenhaus, International Board of Jewish Missions (IBJM) has been reaching out to God's chosen people, the Jews, with the Good News of Messiah - the Lord Jesus Christ. IBJM is engaged in establishing New Testament churches. Our workers present the gospel to Jewish people through weekly home Bible studies, a unique church program and personal evangelism. IBJM also seeks to educate the local church in methods of effective Jewish evangelism; and to edify believers through conferences. Our work is international in scope as we are engaged in great evangelistic efforts overseas, such as in the former Soviet Union.
