United Way of the Quad Cities Area's mission is to improve lives and make a positive impact in our community by mobilizing people and resources. Our vision is to do this by: identifying priority issues on which we will have impact; convening and influencing people and organizations to take action on identified priority issues; connecting people to available services and programs they need to improve their lives; measuring the results of programs, collaboratives and initiatives we support; valuing and reflecting the diversity of our community; and raising maximum resources to achieve our goals. United Way of the Quad Cities Area invests in over 100 local health and human service programs that deliver results in the areas most important to the Quad Cities.
