Founded in 1971, Sojourners' mission is to articulate the biblical call to social justice, inspiring hope and building a movement to transform individuals, communities, the church and the world. In response to this call, we offer a vision for faith in public life by: publishing Sojourners magazine, SojoMail and other resources that address issues of faith, politics, and culture from a biblical perspective; preaching, teaching, organizing, and public witness; nurturing community by bringing together people from the various traditions and streams of the church; and hosting an annual program of voluntary service for education, ministry, and discipleship. In our lives and in our work, we seek to be guided by the biblical principles of justice, mercy, and humility.
