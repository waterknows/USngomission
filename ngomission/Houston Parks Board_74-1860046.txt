The Houston Parks Board was created in 1976 in response to a request by Houston's major foundations and civic leaders who wanted to contribute to the city's park system through an organization that would represent their needs and desires. Since its inception, the Houston Parks Board has raised and leveraged millions of dollars and touched at least 75% of the City's parkland either through acquisitions and/or capital improvements. As a result of the flexibility with which Houston Parks Board operates, it is involved in a wide range of activities related to the expansion and improvement of the parks system. The Houston Parks Board's primary programs are its Park Creation Campaign (acquiring parkland to create new parks and expand existing parks) and its Park Improvement Projects (creating new amenities or renovating existing facilities).
