River Bend Foodbank was established in 1982. Because of the farm implement crisis, tens of thousands of high paying jobs were lost in the Quad City area, and the demand was extremely high for assistance from food pantries and other relief organizations. We collect wholesome donations of food from the food industry for distribution to more than 300 charitable community organizations that support the hungry. The Foodbank's service area includes the Quad Cities and 22 counties in Eastern Iowa and Western Illinois. River Bend Foodbank leads the way as the most cost effective distributor of donated food in the community. The food that our member agencies receive is free, with a shared maintenance fee included on most items to help defray the cost of transporting, soliciting, collecting, sorting, inspecting and distributing the food that serve families in need. Our partner agency programs save millions of dollars each year by using our food distribution program. We also provide direct service to hungry kids through our Kids Cafes and Backpack Program.
