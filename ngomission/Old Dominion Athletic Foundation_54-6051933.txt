The Old Dominion Athletic Foundation (ODAF) is integral to the success of Old Dominion University Athletics, and is the channel through which our fans and alumni can partner with our coaches and student-athletes for the advancement of the athletics program. With the ever-increasing cost of competing at the NCAA Division I level, a dynamic donor base is critical to putting the strongest possible teams on the field and court. The mission of the ODAF is to raise financial support for Old Dominion University athletics and to ensure that our coaches and student athletes have everything they need to compete for national championships.
