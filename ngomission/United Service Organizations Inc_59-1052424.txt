The Greater Jacksonville Area USO exists to serve those who so courageously serve our nation. We extend the welcoming touch of home to members of our armed forces and their families throughout Northeast Florida and Southeast Georgia. Each year, the Greater Jacksonville Area USO touches the lives of more than 250,000-plus local active-duty military, including local and statewide Army and Air National Guardsmen and Reserves, and their immediate families.
