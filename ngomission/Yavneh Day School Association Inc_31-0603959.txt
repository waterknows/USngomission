Rockwern Academy is Greater Cincinnati's Jewish Community Day School, serving children and their families from across the spectrum of Jewish life. We integrate Jewish values, history, literacy and culture into a rich general and Judaic curriculum which fosters a passion for life-long learning, a strong Jewish identity, and a connection to Israel. Our nurturing educational community creates opportunities for leaders to emerge. Yavneh students are intellectually engaged, spiritually aware and socially responsible. Formerly known as Yavneh Day School, Rockwern Academy's excellence is based on a singular and consuming focus on the needs of individual children, in a commitment to helping those children become the best Jewish human beings they can in all areas, and in a culture of flexibility and innovation that allows this focus to remain true despite changing times.
