Formed by the merger of the American Music Center and Meet the Composer, New Music USA provides over $1 million each year in grant support for the creation and performance of new work and community building throughout the country. The voice of the new music community is amplified through the website NewMusicBox, profiling the people and ideas that energize and challenge music makers today. In addition, a wide-ranging catalog of new music is streamed around the clock on Counterstream Radio and an online library is provided for composers to feature their own music.
