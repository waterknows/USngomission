Habitat for Humanity San Fernando/Santa Clarita Valleys was founded in 1990 as an affiliate for Habitat of Humanity International. We are a locally run, independent, non-profit organization serving North Los Angeles County and the Antelope Valley, building houses for low-income working families and veteran families. To date, we have built over 222 homes and are among the top 5% of Habitat affiliates nationwide to reach this goal. This is a new kind of Habitat, for a new generation. We strive to provide a decent, safe and affordable place to live for every man, woman and child in the San Fernando Santa Clarita and Antelope Valleys. We further promote education and self-sufficiency by connecting our recipients to social services.
