Founded in 1970, the Community Environmental Council (CEC) works to provide education and conduct research in the field of conservation. CEC is a well-established environmental organization focused exclusively on energy efficiency and renewables, alternative transportation, and climate change. We work from grassroots to policy levels to help community members reduce their carbon footprint and to end our region's dependency on fossil fuels to become fossil free by 2033. CEC conducts various research projects relating to energy and climate change and seminars to provide information to others, including the public, in this field.
