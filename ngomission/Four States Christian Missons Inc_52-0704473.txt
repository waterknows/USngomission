Four States Christian Missions provides room and board for needy people and provides work through refurbishment of donated items sold in the mission stores. In addition, Four States Christian Missions furthers the Christian aims in the community. We have facilities to shelter approximately 60 men. Food, clothing, personal care items, medical referrals and Biblical counseling are also provided free of charge. A soupline provides a free hot meal every day for street people and bags of groceries are given to families in need. Our ministry to children includes a free day camp for children every summer and a Bible correspondence course and our ministry to women includes a weekly Bible study where ladies also receive bags of food.
