Founded in 2001, Spread the Word Nevada is dedicated to advancing early childhood literacy by placing books into the hands and homes of children within Southern Nevada's at-risk, low income communities. Through community collaboration, mentorship and family partnership programs, Spread the Word Nevada fosters reading and language development opportunities ultimately leading to brighter academic and economic futures for these children. We are dedicated to changing the lives of our at-risk children, one book at a time.
