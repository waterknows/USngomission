The Mission of the Food Bank is to fight hunger and poverty in our 15-county service area in northeast North Carolina. We are a regional clearing house for the collection and distribution of food and grocery items to non-profit and faith-based organizations for their food programs and to eligible individuals for their food needs. We are guided by a set of Core Values and a Vision for the future: Our Communities Are Hunger Free.
