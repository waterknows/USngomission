The Mustard Seed was created in 1981 to meet the spiritual, physical, emotional and intellectual needs of adults with developmental disabilities by providing a loving and protected Christian community and meaningful activities that allow the participants to fulfill the potential God created within them. We have two group homes on the Mustard Seed campus. Our homes house ten women and eight men in a family-like setting and help our residents win victories and learn life skills while living in a loving and supportive environment. Our Seedsters participate in a ceramic art therapy program Monday-Thursday during our day program.
