The Community Enrichment Center (CEC) provides programming, support and tools that will empower individuals to become independent, self-sufficient with a focus on families while helping restore hope and self-esteem. This is best summarized through our mission to restore hope, share God's love and change lives in our community. A faith-based non-profit organization serving Tarrant County since 1988, the CEC has become a diverse resource for low-income families, homeless families, victims of domestic violence and under-served individuals in the community including seniors and the under-employed. Resources provided by the CEC include: transitional and affordable housing, food assistance, GED education, employment and financial coaching, and a senior citizen network. The main goal of our programming is to provide individuals and families with the resources they need to help them move from crisis to stability and self-sufficiency.
