Established in 1948, the Animal Welfare Association (AWA), provides shelter for orphaned animals, low-cost spay and neuter services, pet assisted therapy and humane education for the community. For more than fifty years, AWA has been committed to the prevention and eradication of animal suffering. Each year, more than 9,500 animals receive care through AWA programs. AWA provides care and shelter for orphaned animals with a capacity of 65 dogs and puppies, 150 cats and kittens, and 60 rabbits and small animals. AWA veterinary staff regularly performs more than 10,000 spay and neuter surgeries each year. During the school year, AWA presents humane education programs to school classrooms and youth groups throughout Camden, Gloucester, and Burlington Counties.
