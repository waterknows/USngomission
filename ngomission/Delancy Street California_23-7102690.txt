In 1971 Delancey Street began with four residents, a thousand dollar loan, and a dream to develop a new model to turn around the lives of people in poverty, substance abusers, former felons, and others who have hit bottom, by empowering the people with the problems to become the solution. More than 35 years later we remain true to our mission. We have been solving these problems: generations of poverty, illiteracy, lack of job skills, hard core substance abuse, homelessness, crime, violence, teen pregnancy, and emotional and physical abuse. After an average of four years (a minimum stay of two years), our residents gain an academic education, three marketable skills, accountability and responsibility, dignity, decency, and integrity.
