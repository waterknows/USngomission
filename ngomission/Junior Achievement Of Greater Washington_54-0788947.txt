Junior Achievement of Greater Washington empowers young people to own their economic success. From kindergarten through twelfth grade, Junior Achievement's programs provide financial literacy education experiences to students that are both unique and exciting, yet fully correlate with the requisite Standards of Learning. Learning about economics - whether it is a concept as simple as "wants and needs" or as complex as "modern international trade" - is a valuable and enriching experience for students. The JA lessons are taught by adult role models from the local community, including businesspeople, parents, and university students. We recruit volunteers throughout Greater Washington to educate children using both JA's professionally developed, time-proven curriculum, as well as the volunteer's own experiences from the professional world. All JA programs focus on the key content areas of entrepreneurship, work readiness, and financial literacy.
