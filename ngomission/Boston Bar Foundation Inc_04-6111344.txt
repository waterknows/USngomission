The mission of the Boston Bar Foundation is to promote justice by funding and promoting innovation in legal services, enhancing access to justice for the underserved, and supporting the public interest activities of the bar. As the official charity of the Boston Bar Association, the BBF's mission is inspired by the values of professionalism, service, compassion and responsibility. We believe these are values that all attorneys owe to themselves, their peers and their community. The BBF helps make our justice system more effective, our students more knowledgeable and the City of Boston a better place in which to live and work.
