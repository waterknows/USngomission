United Way of the Piedmont is a nonprofit, volunteer-driven organization dedicated to improving the quality of life for people living and working in Spartanburg, Cherokee and Union Counties. Volunteers review agency programs and initiatives and invest in those programs that positively impact the most critical needs of our community. Funds are raised in the annual campaign and distributed to help those who need it most. In 2012-2013 (our most recent completed fiscal year), this organization raised $4,751,500 to support health and human service needs right here at home. Our focus areas are education, financial stability, and health.
