Casas por Cristo relies on the labor and resources of full time staff missionaries, a board of over 100 pastors and community leaders from Juárez and Acuña, México and San Raimundo, Guatemala and nearly 7,000 annual volunteers from across North America. Through these cross-cultural partnerships, volunteer teams are presented with an amazing opportunity to build a home for a family in need. In just one week teams transform an otherwise empty lot into a safe and secure home - complete with cement foundation, electricity, windows and doors. As a result of this experience, each family receives a tangible symbol of the faithfulness and unconditional love of Jesus Christ. As volunteers gain perspective on the extreme poverty that exists in our world, so do these families better understand God's plan for their lives and His deep desire to take care of their needs.
