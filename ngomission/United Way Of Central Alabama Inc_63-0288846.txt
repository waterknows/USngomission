Organized in 1923, United Way of Central Alabama is committed to increasing the organized capacity of people to care for one another and to improve their community. Our United Way makes funding decisions based on local priorities. United Way supports agencies and programs that work in this community to strengthen families and individuals. Our focus areas are helping children, youth and families; promoting health and rehabilitation; providing for basic needs and emergencies; and providing counseling and mental health services.
