Since 1913, the Symphony has inspired the people of Houston by bringing great music to life. Through its performances, commissions, partnerships and educational programs, the Symphony serves as a wellspring for classical music, setting standards for music education and performance at all levels, from elementary schools to professional orchestras. Through its outreach and community service programs, the Symphony enriches the lives of hundreds of thousands of Houstonians who might otherwise never have an opportunity to experience the excitement of a live orchestral performance. With 84 full-time musicians and a staff of 54, the Houston Symphony produced 228 concerts and recitals in 2009-2010, with an audience reach of more than 600,000 people that reflected Greater Houston's diverse and cosmopolitan population.
