KUSP is an independent community based broadcast voice serving the Central Coast of California. We engage, inform and entertain our audience by providing a distinctive and thoughtful mix of news, public affairs, arts and music programming. KUSP made its first broadcast in 1972. KUSP serves listeners in Santa Cruz, Monterey, San Benito, and South Santa Clara counties, reaching 40,000 listeners per week. KUSP's volunteer programmers produce seventy percent of KUSP's schedule. The balance is made up of leading nationally-distributed public radio programs such as NPR's Morning Edition, PRI's This American Life, and Pacifica Radio's Democracy Now.
