The mission of the Chicago Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, Inc. is to promote and protect civil rights, particularly the rights of poor, minority, and disadvantaged people in order to facilitate their participation in the social, economic, and political systems of our nation. We pursue impact litigation that combats discrimination on a macro level, leverage volunteers to respond to individual cases of discrimination, and provide training to the private Bar to assist them in practicing law for the public good. The Chicago Lawyers' Committee does far more than defend individuals' civil rights. We defend the civil rights of groups of people whose rights are most likely to be threatened, while also teaching others to be allies to our cause.
