Families First's mission is "to contribute to the health and well-being of the Seacoast community by providing a broad range of health and family services to all, regardless of ability to pay." We fulfill the "broad range of services" portion of our mission by providing primary, prenatal and oral health care; mobile health care for people experiencing homelessness; parenting classes and family programs; and many supportive, including care coordination. We make services available "regardless of ability to pay" by offering an income-based sliding fee scale for uninsured and underinsured patients; accepting Medicaid (government health insurance for the very poor and disabled); helping patients obtain health insurance and prescription assistance; prescription assistance; delivering mobile medical and dental care to homeless people at little or no cost; and providing parenting classes and family programs at no cost.
