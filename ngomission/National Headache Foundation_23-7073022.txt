Over the past 42 years, our mission at the National Headache Foundation has been to further awareness of headache and migraine as legitimate neurobiological diseases. Much has changed during this time, and with aid from advanced technology and clinical innovation, there are more treatment options than ever before. However, we understand that these diseases are still largely misunderstood and that finding the right treatment options for you requires nuanced and adaptable insight. We have collected the most comprehensive information on headache and migraine, which we make freely available to you. Every day, our physician finder connects patients, who have just begun to seek treatment or those who are looking for more options, to neurologists and headache specialists.
