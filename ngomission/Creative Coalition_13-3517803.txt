The Creative Coalition was formed for the charitable and educational purposes of bringing together artists and entertainers to learn about pressing issues so they can better inform and influence the community and nation. We sponsor forums for the discussion of central issues such as education policy, violence in America, the role of the media, campaign finance reform and other topics of broad concern. We tackle issues of direct importance to the arts and entertainment community, including First Amendment rights, public funding for the arts, and arts education in the public schools.. We testify before Congress, sponsor awareness-building events, and actively participate in the Democratic and Republican conventions. We also offer special services to our members to help prepare them for public roles as advocates and spokespeople.
