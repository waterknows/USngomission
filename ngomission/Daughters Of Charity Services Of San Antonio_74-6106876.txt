Founded in 1958, the Daughters of Charity Services of San Antonio is a member of Ascension Health. We establish and maintain neighborhood-based programs to increase accessibility to primary health care and human services on the part of the poor. We serve a low-income, uninsured, largely Hispanic population by operating four health and social service centers: DePaul Family Center, La Misi√≥n Family Health Care, De Paul-Wesley Children's Center and El Carmen Wellness Center. Our services include child development, dental care, medical care, wellness services, social services and counseling. All of our services are offered on a low co-pay/sliding scale fee to remain affordable and accessible to individuals and families in need of financial assistance.
