The Positive Futures Network informs and inspires peoples' active engagement in building a more just, sustainable, and compassionate world. Through Yes! Magazine and Yes! Online, we feature powerful ideas and practical actions for solving the most critical environmental, social, and economic issues of our time. We encourage teachers, journalists, grassroots groups, faith organizations, and policy makers to use our articles to promote practical ways to bring about a positive future.
