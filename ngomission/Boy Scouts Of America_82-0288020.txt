The Boy Scouts of America Ore-Ida Council works to prepare young people to make ethical choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Law. We help to provide comprehensive youth development to over 14,000 youth in 987 packs, troops, teams, and posts. Our goals include character development, leadership training, citizenship training, and physical fitness.
