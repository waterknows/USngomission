World Compassion - Terry Law Ministries is a non-denominational, faith-based international organization, founded by Dr. Terry Law in 1969. We work to take the message of Jesus Christ to nations that are hostile to the Gospel, working with local bodies of believers to support the spiritual and physical transformation of lives. Many we touch in these nations with the message of Hope lack the knowledge of the forgiveness of sin through the finished work of Jesus Christ. The four primary areas of focus for World Compassion are Church Planting, Training and Discipleship, Literature, and Humanitarian Outreaches.
