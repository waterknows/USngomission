As a membership organization of North America's premier public library systems and the organizations that serve them, the Urban Libraries Council (ULC) has spent more than 40 years enriching communities by strengthening and promoting the value of libraries as essential public assets. ULC serves as a forum for thought leaders by sharing best and next practices that result from library-based innovations, targeted research and initiatives, publications, convenings and discussion groups. ULC programs are recognized for creating new frameworks that invigorate public libraries and their communities.
