Incorporated in 1974, John Stott Ministries (JSM) serves the church in the majority world by supporting evangelical graduate students who will disciple and train leaders and pastors in their own country; by providing scholarships to strategic leaders; by facilitating programs to help pastors preach (and lead) effectively; and by supporting writers and providing literature to theological students, schools and pastors. JSM has grown as God has encouraged churches, Christian foundations and individual donors to support JSM's three ministry programs: JSM Langham Scholars, JSM Langham Literature and JSM Langham Preaching.
