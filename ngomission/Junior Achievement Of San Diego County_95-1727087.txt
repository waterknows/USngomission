Junior Achievement of San Diego and Imperial Countries inspires and prepares young people to succeed in the global economy. Our volunteer-delivered, experimental programs give students knowledge and skills in financial literacy, work readiness and entrepreneurship. Junior Achievement helps to enhance the relevance of students' classroom learning and increase their understanding of the value of staying in school. We are part of the world's largest organization dedicated to giving young people the knowledge and skills they need to own their economic success, plan for the future, and make smart academic and economic choices. Our financial literacy, work, readiness and entrepreneurship programs empower students to make a connection between what they learn in school and how it can be applied in the real world. This enhances the relevance of their classroom learning and increases their understanding of the value of staying in school.
