Police Athletic League of New Jersey (PALNJ) was founded in 199. PALNJ was formed to provide high quality statewide youth programs and services in the State of New Jersey directly to young people and to be an available resource to more than 70 local PAL programs located throughout New Jersey. The primary objective for the reinvigorated PALNJ is: serve the people and youth of our region by providing high quality programs, that will improve the quality of life in our state, especially programs that will help our youth to become caring, capable and engaged citizens in our complex society. The Mission will be achieved by establishing a high quality operational environment, a financially capable organization and new programs that will be embraced by our youth.
