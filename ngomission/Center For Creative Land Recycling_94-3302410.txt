The Center for Creative Land Recycling (CCLR or "see clear") is focused on creating sustainable communities and encouraging environmentally conscious and socially responsible development. Our goal is to revitalize urban areas, discourage urban sprawl, conserve greenspace, reduce energy consumption, and reverse climate change through the facilitation of land recycling. We believe that the creative reuse of already used lands, (often environmentally-distressed properties, commonly referred to as "brownfields") is the key to responsible land use and sustainable development. Our work is accomplished through training, technical assistance and funding for communities who are attempting to turn around vacant or environmentally distressed properties through creative private, public, and nonprofit partnerships. CCLR was founded in 1996 as a project of The Trust for Public Land (TPL), and became an independent 501(c)(3) organization in 1999.
