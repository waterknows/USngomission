The mission of the Literacy Coalition of Palm Beach County, founded in 1989, is to improve the quality of life in our community by promoting and achieving literacy. Our goal is to ensure that every child and every adult in Palm Beach County becomes a reader. Through extensive outreach and collaboration with a network of community partners, the Literacy Coalition strives to ensure that individuals who need to improve their literacy skills receive the help they need.
