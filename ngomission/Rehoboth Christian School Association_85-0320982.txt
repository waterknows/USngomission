Rehoboth Christian School (RCS) challenges its students to know the Triune God and equips them to love, serve and transform the world in His name. RCS was started by missionaries from the Christian Reformed Church in 1903. Today RCS has over 400 students in grades K-12. Native Americans make up two-thirds of the student population with Anglos, Hispanic and other ethnic minorities making up the rest. Known for its academic excellence, discipline, rigor, responsibility and Christian values, RCS consistently prepares students to be leaders in their professions, communities and churches. Graduates serve in professional fields ranging from medicine, education and engineering to tribal government and the church. More than 90 percent of RCS graduates go on to college or vocational training school.
