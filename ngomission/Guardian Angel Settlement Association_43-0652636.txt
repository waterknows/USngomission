Founded in 1859, the mission of Guardian Angel Settlement Association (GASA) is to serve low-income individuals and families by helping them improve the quality of their lives and achieve economic independence. Based on its heritage, Guardian Angel Settlement Association continues striving to meet the needs of children living in poverty. This can be seen throughout the agency's accredited and licensed developmental child care program located in St. Louis City. Our child care services are provided to families on a sliding-scale fee basis. Other programs offered by GASA include: self-sufficiency programs, emergency services, food pantry, thrift store, and seasonal programs.
