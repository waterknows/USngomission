CuriOdyssey, formerly Coyote Point Museum, is a science museum and native animal zoo recognized locally and nationally as a leader in informal science education. Our mission is to educate and inspire people to take care of the earth wisely. Since 1953, we have connected children of all ages to the wonders of the natural world. Today, we continue to spark the curiosity and imagination of more than 100,000 children and families each year through interactive science exhibits, exciting animal encounters, and engaging school and public programs.
