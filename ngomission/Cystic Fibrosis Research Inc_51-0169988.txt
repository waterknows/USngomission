The Cystic Fibrosis Research, Inc. (CFRI) works to fund research, provide educational and personal support, and spread awareness of cystic fibrosis (CF), a life-threatening genetic disease. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited chronic disease that affects the respiratory, digestive and reproductive systems. As we work to find a cure for cystic fibrosis, CFRI envisions informing, engaging, and empowering the CF community to help all who have this challenging disease attain the highest possible quality of life. Our committees include: the Research Advisory Committee, which administers, reviews and offers guidance on what cystic fibrosis research to fund; the Events Committees, which organize and coordinate many popular events throughout the year; and the Newsletter Committee, which produces our award-winning monthly newsletter, with over 15,000 subscribers.
