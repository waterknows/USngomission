Founded in 1967, the mission of Strawbery Banke Museum is to promote understanding of the lives of individuals and the value of community through encounters with the history and ongoing preservation of a New England Seaport Neighborhood. Visitors to Strawbery Banke have the opportunity to experience and imagine how people lived and worked in this typical American neighborhood throughout four centuries of history. Through its restored houses, its featured exhibits, its historic landscapes and gardens, and its interpretive programs, Strawbery Banke tells the stories of the many generations who settled in the Portsmouth, NH, community from the late l7th to the mid-20th century. Annually, the Museum serves 65,000 individuals of all ages.
