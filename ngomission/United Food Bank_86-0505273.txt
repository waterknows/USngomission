Established in 1983, United Food Bank began operation in Mesa, Arizona. Our mission is to provide access to nutritious food for those who are without, serving as a community bridge between those who want to help and those who are in need. United Food Bank defines its work as neighbors helping neighbors. We provide hunger relief/food assistance by collecting, acquiring, storing and distributing food and related commodities through a network of partner social services agencies in our service area: eastern Maricopa County, Gila & Pinal Counties and southern Apache & Navajo Counties.
