Founded in 1989, A Child's Place (ACP) works to erase the impact of homelessness on children and their education. Our purpose is to enable client homeless children to have the same educational opportunities and advantages as other children. Most of our client families are working poor, and virtually all of them live well below the poverty line. For them, homelessness is not a way of life, but a time in their lives. By minimizing the impact of this difficult time on the academic progress of children, ACP contributes to the likelihood that they will be promoted each year, graduate from high school and ultimately break the cycle of poverty.
