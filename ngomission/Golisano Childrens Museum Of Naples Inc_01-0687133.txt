The mission of the Golisano Children's Museum of Naples is to provide an exciting, inspiring environment where children and their families play, learn and dream together. Founded in 2002, we celebrate the natural curiosity of children by offering an educationally dynamic space that encourages exploration and discovery. This safe and wonderful place inspires children and families to have fun while learning together. The Golisano Children's Museum of Naples is a two-story 30,000 square foot cultural institution including ten permanent and temporary exhibit galleries, a Family Resource Library, classrooms, birthday party room, meeting rooms, Garden Cafe and Museum Store as well as space for staff, volunteers and ongoing operations. All facilities are designed to be fully accessible. The exhibits blend state-of-the-art technology with a replication of the natural world and human communities. Developed by experts in child psychology, museum master planning and exhibit design this experiential play fosters creativity, curiosity, empathy and self-esteem. Play allows children to develop the social skills needed to cooperate with others, sharpen their senses as a means for exploration, strengthen gross and fine motor skills and develop problem solving techniques.
