Since 1981, the Chicago Legal Clinic has evolved from a small neighborhood office to a keystone provider of legal services to the working poor and disadvantaged in the Chicago area. This entails providing direct legal counseling and high quality representation at low cost or pro bono and free educational seminars on legal topics. Through our efforts, hundreds of clients have received legal protection from domestic violence, had their immigration status formalized, adopted children and been rescued from foreclosure. Thousands more received representation in other areas, including landlord/tenant, guardianships, consumer issues and the quest for social security disability benefits.
