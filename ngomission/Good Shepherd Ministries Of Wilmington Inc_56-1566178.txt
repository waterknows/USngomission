Good Shepherd Center began as a modest soup Kitchen in 1983, when a local church opened its parish hall to serve the homeless a lunch of soup and a sandwich. From this small beginning, the program has grown to include a weekday breakfast and lunch available to anyone in need of food, as well as a dinner meal 7 nights a week for guests of the Night Shelter. The mission of Good Shepherd Center is to feed the hungry, shelter the homeless, and foster transition to housing.
