On October 1, 2009, the Emergency Winter Shelter and Uptown Shelter merged to become Men's Shelter of Charlotte. Our goal is to be the safety net for homeless men by identifying and filling service gaps, ensuring an adequate supply of emergency shelter beds, and offering a continuum of supportive services that help men move beyond homelessness. The Men's Shelter assists unaccompanied adult men experiencing homelessness in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg County area by: providing safe emergency shelter and meeting basic needs; addressing barriers related to homelessness and self-sufficiency; and by helping guests obtain and maintain more appropriate housing.
