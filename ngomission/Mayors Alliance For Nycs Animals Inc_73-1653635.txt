Founded in 2003, the Mayor's Alliance for NYC's Animals is committed to seeing the day when no New York City dog or cat of reasonable health and temperament is killed merely because he or she does not have a home. The Mayor's Alliance for NYC's Animals are saving and re-homing thousands of New York City's dogs and cats. They are the sole umbrella organization for animal welfare in NYC and work with a coalition of 150+ rescue groups and no-kill shelters in order to transform NYC into a no-kill community by 2015.
