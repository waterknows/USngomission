Founded in 1998, the African Leadership and Reconciliation Ministries (ALARM) exists to empower the African church to impact the African continent by developing and equipping leaders with skills and tools to nurture and deepen the Christian faith for the transformation and reconciliation of the African communities. They have trained leaders across east and central Africa in biblical theology, conflict resolution, forgiveness, mediation, leadership skills, and reconciliation. ALARM's programs are designed for grass roots church and community leaders, women, youth, government officials, teachers, military professionals and Christian professionals.
