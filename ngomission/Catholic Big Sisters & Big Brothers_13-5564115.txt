The Mission of the Catholic Big Sisters and Big Brothers is to strengthen low-income families and help them recognize, reach for and achieve their full potential regardless of religious affiliation. For over 100 years, the Catholic Big Sisters & Big Brothers (CBSBB) has provided mentoring services for New York City's Catholic and non-Catholic children from all five boroughs. Today, CBSBB's mentoring program focuses on strengthening the child's entire family, while training volunteers to be friends and guides to a young person in need. Our comprehensive program provides one-to-one mentoring for children ages 10-18, family-focused counseling and skills-building workshops for mentoring matches.
