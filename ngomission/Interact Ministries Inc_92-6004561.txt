Founded in 1951, InterAct Ministries exists to glorify God by fulfilling the Great Commission among unreached people groups. Stretched across the top of the North Pacific Ocean is a crescent with many communities and peoples hidden from the gospel. InterAct longs to see Jesus worshipped in every one of those communities, so that God's Glory might fill the North Pacific Crescent. Although current members come from a wide variety of denominational backgrounds (e.g. Baptist, Evangelical Free, Methodist, Christian & Missionary Alliance, Independent, and more), InterAct Ministries is a non-denominational, non-charismatic mission organization.
