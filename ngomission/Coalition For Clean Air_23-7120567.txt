The Coalition for Clean Air is committed to restoring clean, healthy air to all of California and strengthening the environmental movement by promoting broad-based community involvement, advocating responsible public policy and providing technical expertise. The Coalition for Clean Air was founded more than 35 years ago, at a time when clean air in California seemed almost unimaginable. From spearheading California's original Smog Check program, which reduces 100 tons of automobile pollution every day, to strongly supporting and helping pass California's landmark global warming laws, we have helped position California as a world leader in reducing air pollution.
