Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens (CMBG) began as an idea in 1991 by a group of mid-coast Maine residents who envisioned ornamental gardens, protected natural landscapes, and education and research programs. They felt that Maine needed a botanical garden and went about making it happen. In 1996 they purchased a 128 acres of land. Its native forest, intriguing topography, massive ledges, and 3,600 feet of tranquil tidal shorefront were quintessentially Maine.
