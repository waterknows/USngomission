The mission of USO Metropolitan Washington is to lift the spirits of America's troops and their families. USO-Metro is dedicated to "serving those who serve, and their families" in Washington D.C., Maryland and Northern Virginia. With the help of nearly 5,000 devoted volunteers, USO-Metro provides programs and services for active duty troops and their families at area military hospitals, five USO Centers, four USO airport lounges and a Mobile USO. Signature programs and services include holiday programs like Turkeys for Troops and Project USO Elf, emergency housing and food assistance, and caring for our wounded, ill and injured troops and their caregivers.
