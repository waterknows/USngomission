Founded in 1789, Georgetown University is the nation's oldest Catholic and Jesuit university. Today, Georgetown is a major international research university that embodies its founding principles in the diversity of our students, faculty, and staff, our commitment to justice and the common good, our intellectual openness, and our international character. Georgetown comprises four undergraduate schools, three graduate and professional schools, medical residencies, and other programs predicated on the liberal arts tradition at the heart of the institution.
