The Mono Lake Committee is a citizen's group dedicated to protecting and restoring the Mono Basin Ecosystem, educating the public about Mono Lake and the impacts on the environment of excessive water use, and promoting cooperative solutions that protect Mono Lake and meet real water needs without transferring environmental problems to other areas. Since 1978, the Committee has fought to protect Mono Lake from excessive water diversions to Los Angeles. Through litigation, legislation, cooperation, and most importantly, public support, our efforts have been successful so far. However, much work remains to restore desiccated waterfowl habitat and riparian vegetation, educate the public, promote water conservation, and maintain Mono Lake's protected status in state and federal political arenas.
