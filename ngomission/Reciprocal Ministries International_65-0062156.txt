Reciprocal Ministries International (RMI) develops reciprocal, cross-cultural, intimate, in-depth, ongoing, practical and spiritual Sister Church Partnerships between evangelical churches located throughout Haiti and all across the United States. RMI is the lay person's mission, preparing and enabling lay people to minister cross culturally through the Sister Church Program. Our purpose is to enable the Body of Christ to minister reciprocally through the sister church program in order to assist Christ's Church towards maturity.
