Founded in 2001, The Free Clinics (TFC) enhances the healthcare system in Hendeson County, North Carolina, and neighboring communities to ensure the accessibility of quality healthcare for uninsured, low-income clients. TFC works with volunteers and partnering healthcare providers to provide healthcare, prevention, education, medication access, and case management services, including specialty referrals. TFC strives to provide services that are not duplicated, instead focusing our energies and resources on those areas where care is unavailable or access is very limited.
