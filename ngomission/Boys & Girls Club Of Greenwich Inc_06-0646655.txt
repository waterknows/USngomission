The Boys & Girls Clubs of Greenwich works to enable all young people, especially those who need us most, to realize their full potential as productive, caring, responsible citizens. We are committed to promoting high-quality educational programs, building a sense of character and citizenship, maintaining diversity, and offering kids a safe, nurturing, and affordable environment.
