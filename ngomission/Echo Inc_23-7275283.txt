ECHO exists to reduce hunger and improve lives through agricultural training and resources. A non-denominational Christian organization, its international headquarters is located on a tropical agriculture demonstration farm in North Fort Myers, Florida. ECHO provides agricultural and appropriate technology training and resources to development workers in more than 180 countries. Among these resources is a large knowledge base of practical information, experienced technical support and an extensive seed bank focused on highly beneficial underutilized plants. ECHO also works to identify, validate, document and disseminate best practices in sustainable agriculture and appropriate technology. Finally, ECHO creates opportunities for field-based practitioners to connect with each other to share experience, ideas and encouragement. In a time of rising food prices, more women, children and men are facing hunger and malnutrition.
