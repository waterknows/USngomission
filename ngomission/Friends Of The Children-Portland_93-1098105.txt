Founded in 1993, Friends of the Children, Portland provides Portland's most at-risk children with intensive and long-term mentors. We take a preventive, early intervention approach that breaks the cycle of poverty and abuse by helping children in need overcome the many obstacles in their lives. We make a twelve and a half year commitment to each child, selecting them in kindergarten and guiding them through high school graduation. Friends of the Children, Portland has 42 Friends guiding, supporting and mentoring more than 350 children.
