The California Pan-Ethnic Health Network (CPEHN) is a multicultural statewide advocacy organization that works to improve the health of communities of color. Our policy center highlights ongoing policy efforts to improve the health of communities of color. Our events bring our communities together to share information and provide a forum to develop a unified agenda to advance health equity. Our race & ethnicity data collects the most up-to-date studies and statistics on the health of our communities and the inequities we experience. CPEHN works to build a unified, inclusive movement to achieve health equity, and has been instrumental in establishing and leading statewide coalitions.
