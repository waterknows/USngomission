Oregon Natural Desert Association (ONDA) works to ensure that vast swaths of your lands remain wild, open spaces that will be there for future generations to enjoy. Over 8 million acres of these lands qualify as Wilderness but are yet to be protected as such. Until permanent protections are gained, these lands are at risk. Oregon Natural Desert Association also works to ensure that the recent interest in energy development in Oregon's high desert is thoughtful and balances other values such as wildlife habitat and scenic values. ONDA works to ensure that critical areas, such as Hart Mountain, regain ecological health. Through a diligent focus on these priority areas and backed by thousands of supporters, ONDA is a powerful voice for conservation of Oregon's desert wildlands.
