Founded in 1984, The Make-A-Wish Foundation of Mississippi's mission is to grant the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions to enrich the human experience with hope, strength, and joy. Fulfilling a child's wish provides a joyful and meaningful experience that benefits both the child and the family. The Make-A-Wish Foundation of Mississippi has granted more than 1,100 wishes since its founding. For many of these children, a wish experience provides strength and hope for the future.
