Established in 1898, Joslin Diabetes Center works to improve the lives of people with diabetes and its complications through innovative care, education and research that will lead to prevention and cure of the disease. Joslin Diabetes Center is affiliated with Harvard Medical School. Joslin Diabetes Center is the only diabetes institution in the world that goes beyond a single focus. With efforts in three critical areas a synergy develops: researchers, clinicians and educators collaborate in ways that produce cutting-edge scientific discovery, unique clinical care models and pioneering educational strategies. This one-of-a-kind framework has an impact on people with diabetes locally, nationally and across the globe.
