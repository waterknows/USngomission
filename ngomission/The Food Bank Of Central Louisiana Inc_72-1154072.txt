The Food Bank of Central Louisiana's mission is to alleviate hunger in Central Louisiana. We distribute food and grocery products to needy families through a network of approved charitable agencies in eleven parishes: Allen, Avoyelles, Catahoula, Concordia, Grant, LaSalle, Natchitoches, Rapides, Sabine, Vernon and Winn. Food is channeled through more than 68 member agencies including food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters, and other nonprofit organizations. The Food Bank distributes more than six million pounds of food to Central Louisiana each year. This is estimated to serve more than 17,000 needy people per month.
