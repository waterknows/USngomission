The Foundation of Shalom Park provides social, educational, athletic and recreational facilities and programs to allow members of the greater Charlotte Jewish community and others to interact with each other and develop a greater awareness of Judaism and their common heritage. Shalom Park brings together the Charlotte Jewish community's resources on 54 rolling, wooded acres on Providence Road in Charlotte. The Foundation of Shalom Park is responsible for the physical site of this centerpiece of Jewish life in the Carolinas. Shalom Park is undertaking a $30 million expansion project, which will bring a host of new facilities for the use of the Jewish and Greater Charlotte communities.
