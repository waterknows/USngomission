Families Against Mandatory Minimums Foundation (FAMM) is the national voice for fair and proportionate sentencing laws. We shine a light on the human face of sentencing, advocate for state and federal sentencing reform, and mobilize thousands of individuals and families whose lives are adversely affected by unjust sentences. FAMM's vision is a nation in which sentencing is individualized, humane, and sufficient but not greater than necessary to impose just punishment, secure public safety, and support successful rehabilitation and reentry. FAMM's national membership includes prisoners and their families, attorneys, judges, criminal justice experts and concerned citizens.
