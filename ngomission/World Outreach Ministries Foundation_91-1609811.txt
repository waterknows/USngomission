World Outreach Ministry Foundation (WOMF) is dedicated to reach out to the unreached people of the world with the Gospel of Jesus Christ using every known tool of evangelism! We are there to take the territories of Africa for God and lift high the sovereignty of Jesus wherever the soles of our feet should trod. We are not only teaching the love of God but showing the love of God. WOMF currently has missions in Sudan and Uganda, where we construct churches, assist in deep well drilling, care for orphans; lead pastoral training, and provide medical care and educational services.
