Since 1910, the Green Mountain Club's (GMC) mission has been to make the Vermont Mountains play a larger part in the life of the people by protecting and maintaining the Long Trail System and fostering, through education, the stewardship of Vermont's hiking trails and mountains. GMC primarily cares for the Long Trail. Additionally, GMC's advocacy and education efforts also safeguard Vermont's many other hiking trails. GMC volunteers and staff teach low-impact practices and safety skills that outdoor enthusiasts use whenever they hit the backwoods. Through its land protection program in northern Vermont, the Club has protected more than fifty-five miles of the Long Trail System and 16,000 acres of backcountry land.
