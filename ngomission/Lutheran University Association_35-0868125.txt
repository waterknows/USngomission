Founded in 1859, Valparaiso University (Valpo) enrolls approximately 4,000 students from most states and more than 40 countries. They pursue majors in more than 70 fields of study in our five colleges, graduate division and law school. Our students are also engaged outside the classroom, participating in numerous volunteer and service learning activities as well as a wide variety of campus organizations and recreational sports. Valpo belongs to a small and distinctive group of colleges and universities that consistently earns national recognition for the quality of its academic programs that integrate the best of the liberal arts with professional preparation, combining theory with practice. Our Lutheran heritage provides students freedom to connect their faith to life.
