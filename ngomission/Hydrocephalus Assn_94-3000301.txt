The Hydrocephalus Association's mission is to eliminate the challenges of hydrocephalus by stimulating innovative research and providing support, education and advocacy for individuals, families and professionals dealing with hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus is an abnormal accumulation of fluid - cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF - within cavities called ventricles inside the brain. Hydrocephalus occurs when there is an imbalance between the amount of CSF that is produced and the rate at which it is absorbed. As the CSF builds up, it causes the ventricles to enlarge and the pressure inside the head to increase. We advocate for increased research and funding to advance understanding, improve diagnosis and treatment, and find a cure.
