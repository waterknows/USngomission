The mission of Boys and Girls Homes of North Carolina is to provide residential and foster care/adoption programs for neglected, abused, and hurting children that emphasize academic and Christian education to address their physical, emotional, social, and spiritual needs in a homelike, Christian setting. Our goal as we work with the children is to reunite them with their families when possible. When it is not, we provide love, care, and guidance for the children as long as it is needed. In our fifty plus years, more than 3,600 children have been a part of the Boys and Girls Homes family. Though most referrals come from North Carolina, we have also served children

of other states including neighboring South Carolina and Virginia because of issues related to neglect, abuse,

or other societal problems.
