Founded in 2001, NetHope's mission is to act as a catalyst for collaboration, bringing together the knowledge and power of 38 leading international humanitarian organizations so that the best information communication technology and practices can be used to serve people in the developing world. They do this by working across their membership as a highly collaborative team, solving common technology problems, fostering strong relationships with private industry and educating their members and the wider humanitarian community, worldwide. Their work is guided by six fundamental values: technology matters; benefitting all benefits one; learning through collaboration; build for the field; bias for action; and trust above all else.
