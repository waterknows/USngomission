The Shreveport-Bossier Rescue Mission has served as a beacon of hope to the homeless and hurting in the Shreveport-Bossier community since 1955 and its arms are outstretched even wider today because the need is greater. Rev. R. G. Jones and a group of Christian businessmen with a heart for the poor and needy started this Christian ministry to provide emergency food, clothing and shelter to homeless men in need. For over twenty years, the Mission has been led by Rev. Henry Martin. In 2007, a new facility made possible through donations opened which feeds and houses women and families with children, as well as men. The purpose of the Shreveport-Bossier Rescue Mission is to help people in need, especially the homeless and disadvantaged.
