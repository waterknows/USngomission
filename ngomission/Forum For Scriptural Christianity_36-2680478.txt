The Good News movement is a voice for repentance, an agent for reform, and a catalyst for renewal within the United Methodist Church. By God's grace, we will proclaim and demonstrate the power and effectiveness of historic Christianity as emphasized in Wesleyan doctrine and practice. Good News advocates Scriptural Christianity with holy living among United Methodists; nurtures evangelical fellowship within a worshipping, caring, and inclusive community; seeks diligently to be faithful and challenge unfairness wherever it is found in the church; informs and educated United Methodists about issues challenging the church and creates and/or assists in creating supplemental church structures if necessary.
