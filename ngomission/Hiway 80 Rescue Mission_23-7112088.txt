Founded in 1955, Hiway 80 Rescue Mission Ministries has been reaching out and touching lives for over 50 years. We are commissioned by our Lord to help the poor and needy not only when it is convenient, but when the needs arise. Therefore, in our community of East Texas, we hear the cries of the alcoholics, drug addicts and the battered single women or mothers that do not have an advocate. Hiway 80 Rescue Mission continues to provide emergency shelter for men, women and families who are homeless and in need of help.
