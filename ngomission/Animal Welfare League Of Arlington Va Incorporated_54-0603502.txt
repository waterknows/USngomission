The Animal Welfare League of Arlington's mission is to improve the lives of animals. The League provides temporary care and refuge for homeless and suffering animals; places animals in loving, responsible homes; prevents cruelty to animals; provides animal control services; educates the public; and provides community services. Founded in 1944, the League provides animal control and sheltering for Arlington County under contract, and also offers many community service programs. The Animal Welfare League of Arlington also has several outreach programs to assist pets and their owners including humane education, spay/neuter programs, and caring for pets at the League when owners face an emergency.
