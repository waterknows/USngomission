Founded in 1982, the Share and Care Foundation works to enhance the quality of lives of underprivileged woman and children by supporting programs in the fields of Primary Healthcare and Education. The Foundation began with a very simple idea to convert what is considered waste in the western world into much needed help in the East. The idea became reality when good quality used clothes were collected and sent to orphanages and women's home in rural India. Medical supplies and equipment that were considered obsolete in the west but were a leap forward in remote areas were soon included in the shipments. These supplies dramatically improved the quality of care in charitable hospitals there.
