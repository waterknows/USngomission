DIFFA (Design Industries Foundation Fighting AIDS) is one of the country's largest supporters of direct care for people living with HIV/AIDS and preventive education for those at risk. Merging care and commerce, supporters of DIFFA come from all fields of fine design and the visual arts, including: architecture, fashion design, interior design, photography and consumer product design. Since being founded in 1984 by Patricia Green and Larry Pond, DIFFA has granted funds to organizations which fight AIDS by providing: preventive education programs targeted to populations at risk of infection; treatment and direct-care services for people living with HIV/AIDS; and public policy initiatives which add resources to private sector efforts.
