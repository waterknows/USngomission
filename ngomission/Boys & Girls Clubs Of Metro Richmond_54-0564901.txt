The Boys & Girls Clubs of Metro Richmond (BGCMR)'s mission is to empower young people, especially those from disadvantaged circumstances, to succeed in life. They do this by promoting the development of young people by instilling a sense of belonging, a sense of usefulness, a sense of influence and a sense of competence. When this strategy is fully implemented, self-esteem is enhanced and an environment is created which helps young people to reach their full potential. BGCMR's core program areas are Character & Leadership Development, Education & Career Development, Health & Life Skills, The Arts and Sports, Fitness & Recreation.
