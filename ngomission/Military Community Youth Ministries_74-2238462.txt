At Military Community Youth Ministries (MCYM), we believe that there is a great need to reach military youth, to build meaningful, no-strings-attached relationships with them. We believe that one of the best ways to help military kids is to affirm them and be available to celebrate life with them. Toward this end, MCYM staff and volunteers seek to love teens unconditionally and provide a model of Christian hope in our military communities through weekly Club and fun activities. MCYM serves at locations with nearly 89,200 military teens. Over 95 full-time staff along with hundreds of volunteer leaders are working in over 44 military communities around the world.
