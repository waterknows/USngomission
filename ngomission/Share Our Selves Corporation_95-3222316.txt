Founded in 1970, Share Our Selves (SOS) has grown to become a model nonprofit organization providing the highest quality comprehensive safety net services to the homeless and low-income populations in Orange County. Share Our Selves was established to provide for the most serious concerns of the poor residing in Orange County, including food, clothing and emergency financial aid for housing, transportation, prescriptions and children's needs. SOS has since expanded to include medical and dental care. SOS acts as a caring and non-discriminating servant and works for increased awareness and systemic change in response to the needs of thousands of homeless and financially disadvantaged in their community.
