Habitat for Humanity of Summit County, established in 1986, builds and renovates homes in partnership with qualified families and is dedicated to making housing available in local communities for families in need. Programs 

range from providing micro-loans and labor to help fix up neighborhood houses to engaging young people ages 5 to 25 in advocacy, volunteering and fundraising to help end poverty housing and build homes in their own communities.
