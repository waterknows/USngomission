The American Lung Association (ALA) of the Midland States was founded on July 1, 2007 by the merger of several State ALA organizations. As the oldest voluntary health organization in the United States, the American Lung Association's mission is to prevent lung disease and promote lung health. As a charter member of the nationwide organization, the American Lung Association of the Midland States is committed to carrying out this mission in Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee. In communities throughout the Midland States region, the American Lung Association is working to improve life one breath at a time through education, advocacy and research.
