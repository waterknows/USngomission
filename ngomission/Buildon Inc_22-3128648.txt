buildOn breaks the cycle of poverty, illiteracy, and low expectations through service and education. Through buildOn afterschool programs in high schools across the U.S., urban youth are contributing intensive service, helping seniors, young children, and the homeless in their communities, and are also helping to build schools in some of the poorest countries on the planet.



Students in buildOn programs, located in 118 of America's lowest performing urban high schools, have contributed 760,000 hours of service. buildOn also partners these same students with developing countries in Africa, Asia, and Central America to build schools. buildOn's school construction programs have completed 383 schools to date. 



More than 57,000 children and adults attend these schools daily. And with 95% of our US students attending college; buildOn is inspiring the next generation of global leaders.
