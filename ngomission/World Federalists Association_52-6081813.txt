Citizens for Global Solutions Education Fund envisions a future in which nations work together to abolish war, protect our rights and freedoms, and solve the problems facing humanity that no nation can solve alone. This vision requires effective democratic global institutions that will apply the rule of law while respecting the diversity and autonomy of national and local communities. The Education Fund works closely with Citizens for Global Solutions in pursuing their shared mission and vision. One project of the Education Fund is to provide support for the World Federalist Institute, an internal think-tank tasked with the challenge of generating new and creative models of effective, democratic global governance.
