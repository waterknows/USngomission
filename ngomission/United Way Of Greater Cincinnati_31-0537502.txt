Founded in 1915, United Way of Greater Cincinnati is a leader and community catalyst mobilizing the caring power of individuals and organizations to help people measurably improve their lives. United Way works every day to advance the common good by focusing on the building blocks for a better life - education, income, and health. We concentrate on these critical issues in order to improve lives and strengthen our communities, and ultimately, to make our region the best it can be. Our impact areas are: preparing children for kindergarten, helping youth achieve success in school and life, helping families and individuals achieve financial stability, and our safety net services provide a foundation of care and support.
