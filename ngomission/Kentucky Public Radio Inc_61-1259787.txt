Louisville Public Media, formerly known as Public Radio Partnership, is the public media group serving Louisville and Southern Indiana. We broadcast on three public radio stations. Louisville Public Media is WFPL, Louisville's NPR News station; Classical 90.5, Louisville's Fine Arts station and WFPK 91.9 Radio Louisville. Additionally we provide online streaming, regional podcasts, mp3 downloads of performances at our studios, and an online community gathering space to discuss local and national topics.
