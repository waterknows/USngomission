Founded in 1959, the Bay Area Humane Society was founded to promote the humane treatment of animals and provide protection, care and shelter for unwanted and homeless pets. The mission of the Bay Area Humane Society is to offer the best possible care and future for companion animals in our community through leadership, placement, and outreach. After more than 50 years and thousands of tails, the Bay Area Humane Society is still operating with the spirit and inspiration of our founders. We love animals. And we're making our community a better place for both pets and people.
