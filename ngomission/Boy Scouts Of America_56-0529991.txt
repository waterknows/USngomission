The Piedmont Council's mission is to serve youth by instilling Scouting values preparing them to make ethical choices to achieve their full potential in life. That the purpose of this corporation shall be to promote, through organization and cooperation with other agencies, the ability of boys to do things for themselves and others, to train them in Scoutcraft, and to teach them patriotism, courage, self-reliance, and kindred virtues, using the methods which are now in common use by Boy Scouts. Two kinds of charters are issued by the Boy Scouts of America: one to community organizations and the other to BSA local councils. The first enables community groups to use the Scouting program under their own leadership as a service to their children, youth, and families. The other empowers local councils to help chartered organizations effectively use the Scouting program and to expand the use of the program to other community groups.
