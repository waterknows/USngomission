Second Helpings rescues prepared and perishable food from wholesalers, retailers and restaurants -- preventing unnecessary waste. That rescued food is used to create 3,500 hot, nutritious meals each day that are distributed to 70 social service agencies that feed people in need. The Second Helpings Culinary Job Training program trains disadvantaged adults for careers in the foodservice industry. This helps eliminate hunger at its source. More than 500 adults have graduated from this program, and Second Helpings alumni are now working in Central Indiana as cooks, executive chefs, business owners and culinary instructors. We're more than a soup kitchen or a food pantry - we're a community kitchen.
