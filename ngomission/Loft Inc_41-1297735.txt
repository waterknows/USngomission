Founded in 1974, The Loft Literary Center advances the artistic development of writers, fosters a thriving literary community, and inspires a passion for literature. As an intergenerational, multicultural literary arts center, the Loft operates as an artist service organization, a gathering place for readers and writers, a community school for the arts, and a presenting organization. Each year, the Loft nurtures hundreds of novelists, poets, spoken word artists, and writers in every genre and style, and connects them to readers and live audiences in the twin cities and across Minnesota, reaching over 750,000 people annually.
