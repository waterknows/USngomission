Reaching Indians Ministries International (RIMI) is an international, interdenominational evangelical Christian missions agency established in 1993. Our vision is to glorify Christ by training indigenous leaders who establish vibrant Christ-centered communities in South Asia and beyond in order to transform lives spiritually, socially and economically. Their mission is to expand Christ's Kingdom through evangelism and church planting, which is further advanced by leadership development and compassion services to all people especially the poor and marginalized people of the society including Dalits, rural women and slum children.
