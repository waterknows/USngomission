The Yitzhak Rabin Center was founded in 1997 to commemorate the life and legacy of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, soldier and statesman, as it relates to Israeli Society, peace and security. The Center is taking an active role in teaching the lessons of the assassination and promoting international leadership development, public dialogue and tolerance. The Center includes a museum, educational wing, archives and library and public spaces. It's educational programs center around the newly opened Museum, the first of its kind to tell the story of the modern state of Israel. Using the life of Yitzhak Rabin as a connecting thread, the museum delves into the history of Israel's development, social challenges, and the events that led to his assassination. It will become an important part of civics studies for all students in Israel.
