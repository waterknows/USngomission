The mission of Esperanza International is to free children and their families from poverty through initiatives that generate income, education and health, restoring self-worth and dignity to those who have lost hope. Esperanza's programs are set up through our Integral Development Model (IDM), which consists of four strategic programs for human development and transformation: 1) Microfinance Services 2) Education and Vocational Training 3) Health Care 4) Community Development Esperanza focuses on long-lasting solutions that enable families to help themselves.
