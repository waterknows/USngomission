The mission of The Redwood Empire Food Bank (REFB) is to end hunger in our community. Founded in 1987, REFB is Sonoma County's largest hunger-relief organization. We acquire food and distribute it through a network of charitable agencies and our own food assistance programs, and also provide food to Lake, Mendocino, Humboldt, and Del Norte Counties through smaller food banks. In addition, the REFB advocates for effective legislation that will provide long-term solutions to hunger in our community. During fiscal year 2011-2012, over 13 million pounds of food was distributed to feed 78,000 people in need of food assistance each month.
