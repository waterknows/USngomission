Founded in 1973 in Birmingham, Alabama, Health Talents International is a non-profit Christian organization that works within the Churches of Christ to promote medical evangelism in developing countries. As Christians, we feel that God expects us to use our talents, medical and otherwise, in His service. (Matthew 25). Through medical evangelism in Central America, HTI will nurture self-supporting and self-replicating bodies of Christ. Our programs include: training and teaching programs, ABC and scholarship programs, medical, dental and surgical clinics, and the MET program.
