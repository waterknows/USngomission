The Shelby Humane Society's mission is to care for homeless, abused, neglected and abandoned animals and educate the community to instill an increased awareness and commitment to the responsibility of animal ownership and protection. Each year, approximately 7,000 animals receive shelter and care within our facility. In addition to the thousands of owner-surrendered animals we take in each year, we also provide medical attention and a safe-house to abused and neglected animals that come into our shelter via local Animal Services. Many of these animals require expensive medical care and constant nurturing. Our adoption programs place nearly 2,300 animals each year.
