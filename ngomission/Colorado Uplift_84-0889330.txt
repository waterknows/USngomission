Founded in 1982, Colorado UpLift offers a unique, comprehensive solution to the issues faced by urban kids. Colorado UpLift provides full-time, salaried teachers, who begin building relationships with kids in 2nd and 3rd grade. Staff follow students from grade to grade until they graduate from high school and go on to pursue post-secondary education. Along the way, staff members teach classes, mentor kids, build resiliency and prepare kids for college. Colorado UpLift's overall goal is to empower urban young people to become leaders and productive citizens through long-term, relational support.
