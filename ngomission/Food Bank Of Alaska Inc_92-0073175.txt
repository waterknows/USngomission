In 1979 Food Bank of Alaska was founded by charities that were feeding their hungry neighbors in order to more effectively and efficiently secure donated and government food that they could distribute. Food Bank of Alaska is dedicated to eliminating hunger in Alaska by obtaining and providing food to 300 partner food pantries and meal programs statewide as well as through anti-hunger leadership. We believe no one deserves to be hungry.
