The mission of the Center for Puppetry Arts is to entertain and enlighten audiences, nurture the world community of artists, expand the puppetry art form, and explore the past, present, and future of puppetry. The Center is a unique cultural treasure - a magical place where children and adults are educated, enlightened and entertained. Since 1978, the Center has introduced millions of visitors to the wonder and art of puppetry, and has touched the lives of many through enchanting performances, curriculum-based workshops and the hands-on Museum, as well as distance learning and outreach programs. Three performance series host a variety of shows geared towards educating as well as entertaining audiences; the Center's Museum houses a collection of puppets, books, posters and videos from around the world.
