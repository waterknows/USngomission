The National Sleep Foundation (NSF) works to improve sleep health and safety through education, public awareness, and advocacy. Awareness programs include the National Sleep Awareness Council to foster sleep health safety coordination among health care organizations, as well as education brochures that are distributed to the public through participating sleep centers. The NSF also engages in ongoing advocacy efforts to educate policy makers about drowsy driving, sleep for kids, and the need for funding to advance research that expands our understanding of sleep disorders.
