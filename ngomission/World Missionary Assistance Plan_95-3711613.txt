World MAP (Missionary Assistance Plan) is a trans-denominational ministry dedicated to fulfilling the Great Commission - making disciples of all nations. World MAP exists to provide church leaders in the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America training that will make them effective messengers of the gospel; and share with believers in the western nations their triumphs and tragedies so that the church will pray more fervently and give more sacrificially to aid and abet the work of these who are on the front lines of evangelism. Our mission is to disseminate scripturally sound, Spirit-filled, and practically-oriented teaching through ACTS Magazine, a 40-page equipping resource; The Shepherd's Staff, a 1,000-page Bible training manual, and; Spiritual Renewal Seminars that teach Third-World church leaders in person in their own nations.
