The mission of DISCOVERY Children's Museum is to provide a vibrant and engaging experience, through exhibits and programs, where children from economically and culturally diverse backgrounds actively participate in playful learning experiences that ignite a love of lifelong learning. Over the years, the museum developed into a critical community asset that complemented and enhanced the educational experience of the children living in Southern Nevada and was regularly recognized for award-winning exhibits and programs. The museum helps redefine Las Vegas as a city that values culture and the arts, an urban lifestyle and, most importantly, its children.
