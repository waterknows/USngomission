MANNA Worldwide is a Christian organization that focuses on caring for impoverished children around the world. We are strategically fighting the global giants of disease, poverty, illiteracy, and spiritual emptiness. As a Christian organization, we feel compelled to care for the less fortunate because of our faith in Jesus Christ. We do not feed people and break the cycle of poverty to convince them of our way of thinking, rather, we have been blessed and thus feel compelled to care for others!
