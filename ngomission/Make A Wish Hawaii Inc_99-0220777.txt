Incorporated late in 1982, Make-A-Wish Foundation of Hawaii, is the thirteenth of 66 chapters in 50 states, Puerto Rico and the Territory of Guam, that comprise the Make-A-Wish Foundation of America. We grant the wishes of children in Hawaii with life-threatening medical conditions to enrich the human experience with hope, strength and joy. Our purpose is to grant the wish of each child between the ages of 2 Â½ and 18 who has a life-threatening medical condition (i.e., a progressive, degenerative or malignant medical condition that has placed the child's life in jeopardy). The first Hawaii wish was granted in 1984. Now, 25 years later, more than 700 wishes have been completed.
