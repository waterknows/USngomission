Incorporated in 1978, the Woodlawn Foundation receives contributions and provides grants to nonprofit organizations that receive pastoral care from the Catholic Prelature of Opus Dei. Woodlawn Foundation supports projects across the United States and internationally. These programs operate in local communities and benefit people from all walks of life. At the present time, Woodlawn provides grants to approximately 40 to 50 nonprofit corporations each year. Over the years, the Woodlawn has handled virtually every type of charitable gift, and helped many people make their gifts in ways that help to minimize taxes. The directors and officers of the Foundation have been chosen because of their professional legal and financial experience.
