Established in 1963, Boys & Girls Club of the East Valley is a community-based, character building youth development organization. We deliver the highest quality programs and provide opportunities to assist youth and teens in developing their self esteem, values and skills in a fun and safe environment. Our professionals guide members through personal, educational and social development to realize their full potential and become positive, value-oriented and productive citizens. Today, we serve more than 30,000 children in the East Valley at 11 branches. For over 45 years, we have made it our number one priority to fill the opportunity gap and provide kids who come to us with a chance to build their talents, learn the value of contributing to others, and realize their dreams.
