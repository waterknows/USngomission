Special Olympics Northern California (SONC) is proud to serve over 13,000 individuals with developmental disabilities. From the Oregon border to Monterey and Tulare counties, our athletes have the opportunity to participate in a wide variety of sports trainings and competitions that take place throughout the year. In order to prepare athletes for competition, they must attend a minimum of eight practices to insure they are prepared to compete. Our programs give our athletes continuing opportunities to develop physical fitness, demonstrate courage, experience joy and participate in the sharing of gifts, skill, and friendship with their families, other athletes and the community.
