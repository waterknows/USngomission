The National Multiple Sclerosis Society, Lone Star Chapter was founded in 1955 with a mission to provide direct services to people affected by multiple sclerosis (MS) and to fund research in an effort to find a cure for the devastating effects of MS. As of October 1, 2007, the North Central Texas and Lone Star Chapters joined forces as one unified voice and chapter. As we continue to search for the right balance between care and cure, we will continue to offer information, education and services through a variety of channels to address the wide range of challenges facing those living with MS. At the same time, we will continue to provide the necessary funds for research.
