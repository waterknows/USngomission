Founded in 1991, IberoAmerican Ministries works to plant churches and provide humanitarian services resulting in people movements that reveal God's glory among the nations. We accomplish these goals by mobilizing, equipping, and deploying servant leaders to fulfill the Great Commission in partnership with others who share the same passion. IberoAmerican Institute is the place were we equip current and future church leaders and missionaries.
