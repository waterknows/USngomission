The Museum of the Shenandoah Valley (MSV) interprets the art, history, and culture of the great valley for which it is named. This regional museum complex in Winchester, Virginia, includes a historic house dating to the eighteenth century, six acres of spectacular gardens, and a museum designed by internationally recognized architect Michael Graves. In addition, MSV maintains the landscape and farmland of all these properties, each of which offers educational programming and exhibitions to its members and visitors.
