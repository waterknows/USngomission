Wounded Warriors Family Support provides support to the families of those who have been wounded, injured or killed during combat operations. The families of our casualties suffer in many ways: some financially, some psychologically. Wounded Warriors Family Support mitigates their trauma by allowing them to find peace and solace as a family once more in family-friendly retreats that we provide free of charge. Providing a low stress environment where they can be free from the cares and worries that often tear a family apart. Many of our young military families are not financially secure and would not be able to afford what we offer to them: a chance to bond with their children, especially after their children were traumatized and adversely affected by a parent's wounds and injuries.
