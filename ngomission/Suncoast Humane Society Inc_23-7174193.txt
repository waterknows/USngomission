Suncoast Humane Society (SHS) exists to reduce the numbers of homeless animals and improve the quality of human life through animal companionship. Founded in 1971 as the Animal Aid Society of Englewood, SHS operates one of the few open admissions shelters in Florida. We accept all animals brought to us by the public, regardless of health or temperament. Medical and behavioral staff evaluates each animal for adoptability. Healthy animals with stable temperaments and good behavior patterns are recommended for adoption. There is no time limit set on their stay, barring serious illness or aggressive behavior. Our wonderful group of Foster Home volunteers, along with our Pet Placement Partners (Breed Rescues), help to make these policies possible.
