â€‹To promote the dignity and independence of seniors who are in need of nutritious meals, companionship, and Alzheimer's care.

Christian Senior Services is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization serving senior residents of Bexar County for over 30 years. Founded in 1977 as a joint venture between St. Johns and Grace Lutheran Church, the agency began delivering a total of eight meals daily to homebound seniors and established an adult day care center for five of their senior clients. Today, our agency is one of the largest non-profit organizations in Bexar County providing services to adults over the age of 55. Christian Senior Services proudly operates Meals of Wheels of San Antonia, Grace Place Alzheimer's Activity Center, and Senior Companion Program.
