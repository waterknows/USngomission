Promise Keepers (PK) is a Christ-centered organization dedicated to introducing men to Jesus Christ as their Savior and Lord; and then helping them to grow as Christians. This is mainly accomplished through our seven promises and our men's conference ministry. Millions of men have participated since 1990 when PK first began. Promise Keepers is dedicated to igniting and uniting men to be passionate followers of Jesus Christ through the effective communication of the seven promises: honoring Jesus Christ; pursuing vital relationships with a few other men; practicing spiritual, moral, ethical, and sexual purity; building strong marriages and families; supporting the mission of his church; reaching beyond any racial and denominational barriers; and influencing his world.
