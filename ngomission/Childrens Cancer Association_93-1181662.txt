Children's Cancer Association (CCA) is a national leader prescribing free, innovative programs of JoyRx and has connected hundreds of thousands of children, teens, and their family members to the power of hope, comfort, and happiness in the last two decades.CCA didn't start with a foundation, it started with a family. One who faced its own battle with serious pediatric illness in Portland, Oregon. From that experience came a passionate focus on the moment, and a commitment to deliver immediate help to kids when their need is the greatest. We prescribe joy. Because we know in the fight against devastating illness, joy is often forgotten and something every child deserves. When seriously ill children, teens and their families need more than medicine, CCA's innovative programs create joy one moment at a time.
