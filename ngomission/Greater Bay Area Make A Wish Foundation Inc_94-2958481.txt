Founded in 1984, Make-A-Wish Greater Bay Area grants the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions to enrich the human experience with hope, strength, and joy. We serve children between the ages of 2 1/2 - 18 who meet our guidelines without regard to race, gender, creed, socio-economic, or cultural background. Make-A-Wish is committed to ensuring that it never has to decline a qualified wish referral nor limit the scope of a child's imagination for his/her wish due to the lack of funds. Now one of the largest chapters nationwide, the Greater Bay Area chapter has granted nearly 7,00 wishes and grants over 300 wishes per year.
