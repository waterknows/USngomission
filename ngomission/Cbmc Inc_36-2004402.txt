CBMC (Christian Businessmen's Connection) is a men's ministry with the mission to present Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord to business and professional men, and to develop Christian business and professional men to carry out the Great Commission. Our vision is for all men in our movement to experience the power of one God; the value of one man; and the leverage of one team, resulting in spiritual reproduction among businessmen throughout the world. CBMC began in the United States in 1930, when a group of Christian businessmen coordinated a series of pre-Easter rallies. Today, CBMC has grown from a small group of men in Chicago to over 18,000 members in 700 teams across the United States. Worldwide, CBMC is active in over 70 countries with over 50,000 members total.
