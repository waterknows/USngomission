Since 1973, Meals On Wheels, Inc. of Tarrant County (MOWI) has provided hot, nourishing meals to elderly and disabled persons who are unable to prepare meals for themselves. The meals, daily contact by caring volunteers and professional case management allow frail, homebound persons to remain in their own homes, where they want to be. Today, a volunteer force of 4,700 delivers to 4,900 people who truly need our help in neighborhoods throughout Tarrant County. Volunteers also deliver blankets, fans, supplemental groceries, medical equipment, microwave ovens, and other items essential to help a client maintain their independence. In addition, MOWI provides professional case management to thousands of frail and isolated persons each year.In addition to meals, the agency has 3 outcome based health programs to assist clients with chronic disease management, medication management, and goal setting to improve overall health.
