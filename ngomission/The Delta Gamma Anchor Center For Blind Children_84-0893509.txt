Through early intervention, Anchor Center for Blind Children works with children to maximize the use of any vision they may have as well as optimizing their use of all senses. Additionally, early intervention enhances the families' ability to support their children's well being, capacity for learning and full participation in their communities. Anchor Center's specialized staff assists children with visual impairments in developing the emotional security, social competence and intellectual skills needed to build on their natural talents and ability to succeed in school.
