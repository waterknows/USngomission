Habitat for Humanity of Northern Virginia is the local affiliate that coordinates all the work that goes into building homes in our service area, which includes Arlington and Fairfax counties, Falls Church, Alexandria, and Fairfax. All the fundraising, build site selection, home construction, mortgage servicing, and partner family selection and support in Northern Virginia is done locally by Habitat Northern Virginia. Since our founding in 1990, we have built homes for more than 300 people, including 180 children! Our unique approach to home building in the Washington, DC metro region includes participating in the Neighborhood Stabilization Program, a project funded by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, and building multi-family housing. Through all of our programs, we have helped over 400 people find, or remain in their homes.
