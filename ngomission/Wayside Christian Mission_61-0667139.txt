The purpose of the Wayside Christian Mission is to respond to human need of the poor and homeless by providing temporary housing, shelter, food, clothing, nurturing, spiritual and social enrichment. We also provide support services and skills that would permit and encourage a return to a state of self sufficiency so that human dignity can be restored and the love of God can be shared.
