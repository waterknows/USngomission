ICA works to offer hope as we provide assistance to our neighbors in need. Our clients are neighbors who find themselves struggling to make ends meet. Most of our clients work, but do not make enough money to cover the basic needs of their families. Some are able to achieve financial stability rather quickly, while others require ongoing assistance and support.
