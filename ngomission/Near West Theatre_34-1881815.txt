Founded in 1978, Near West Theatre builds loving relationships and engages diverse people in strengthening their sense of identity, passion, and purpose, individually and in community, through transformational theatre arts experiences. Based in the Ohio City neighborhood, it has a unique identity as a grassroots, intergenerational theatre with an emphasis on serving youth. Through an intense creative process, participants learn methods of improving socialization skills and self expression in a safe, nurturing environment, as well as interdependence, team building, and problem solving skills.
