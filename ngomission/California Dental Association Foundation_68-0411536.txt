Founded in 1998, California Dental Association Foundation's mission is to improve the oral health of all Californians by supporting the dental profession in its efforts to meet community needs. Oral health is critical to the total health and well-being of an individual. For young children, it means they won't live in pain or miss school. For adults, it can enhance employment outcomes, improve quality of life and, for many, restore dignity. That's why we're tireless in our efforts to provide grant and scholarship opportunities to community-based organizations and individuals to reduce barriers to care in underserved populations. We represent the philanthropic values of the dental profession as it generously gives back to help meet the needs of Californians.
