Founded in 1939, Cal Farley's is one of America's largest privately-funded child welfare providers specializing in both residential and community-based services at no cost to the families of children in our care. Cal Farley's offers three types of services to children and families: residential, educational and community-based. The residential, or campus-based, programs offer children a campus environment where children live in homes or cottages at Cal Farley's Boys Ranch or Cal Farley's Girlstown, U.S.A.. Our basic-care services offer 24-hour supervision in a small community setting. The educational programs provide the children on our campuses academic, athletic and extracurricular opportunities. Our community-based services currently offer a variety of resources to children and families.
