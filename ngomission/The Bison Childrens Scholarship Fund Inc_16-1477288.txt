The BISON Children's Scholarship Fund is a privately funded tuition assistance program for low-income children living in Western New York. Families awarded a BISON scholarship are able to send their child to a private elementary school of their choice. BISON's goal is to equalize educational opportunities for elementary students by offering low-income families educational options normally denied them because of cost. Founded in 1995, the BISON Children's Scholarship Fund has grown from helping 200 children to more than 1,800 children today. BISON believes that every child should have the chance to succeed.
