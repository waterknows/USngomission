Created in 1991, Mountains to Sound Greenway Trust protects and enhances a 100-mile corridor of permanent open space lands along Interstate 90 from Seattle to Central Washington. The Greenway embraces city parks and trails, wildlife habitat, working and protected forests, recreational opportunities in nature, local history, scenic beauty, tourism and educational activities that promote a balance between population growth, and a healthy environment. The Greenway Trust does not own land - instead, we work with public agencies and land conservation organizations to find funding and willing sellers to create this connected green landscape.
