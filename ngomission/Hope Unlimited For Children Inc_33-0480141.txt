Founded in 1991, Hope Unlimited for Children transforms the lives of children at mortal risk, providing them and their future generations a productive future and eternal hope. We minister to the physical, educational, and spiritual needs of Brazil's street children. Hope Unlimited helps these children to experience personal transformation while being equipped to live successful, productive lives as adult members of society. Hope's comprehensive Christ-centered model is long-term, residential, educational and community-based. In order to impact the lives of tens of thousands of street children, we are developing the Hope Institute to train local organizations to serve more effectively and expand their reach.
