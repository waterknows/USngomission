The mission of Fort Ticonderoga is to ensure that present and future generations learn from the struggles, sacrifices, and victories that shaped the nations of North America and changed world history. We serve this mission by preserving and enhancing our historic structures, collections, gardens, and landscapes, and by educating and inspiring the public as it learns about the history of Fort Ticonderoga and the diverse peoples who met here in war and in peace.
