Mission to Haiti provides Christian mission aid to Haiti, primarily though the work of mission teams and sponsorship of school children. The purpose of the mission teams is to bring volunteers to the field to serve the Haitian people through building projects, medical clinics and Bible schools for children. Through these projects, we are able to share the Gospel and to better the daily lives of the Haitian people. Through the child sponsorship program, children are provided with life-changing opportunities such as going to a Christian school, getting nutritious food and health care, and hearing about Jesus and his redemptive love.
