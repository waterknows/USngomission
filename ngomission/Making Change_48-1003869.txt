making change promotes human dignity, wellness and self-sufficient communities. We do this by enabling retailers to provide support to non-profit agencies whose missions are to promote health, education and community spirit. We accomplish this through cause marketing promotions, special events, in-store point-of-purchase campaigns, and fundraising support.
