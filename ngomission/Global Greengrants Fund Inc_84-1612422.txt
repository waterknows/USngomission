Founded in 1993 to support grassroots projects and policy for social environmental justice around the world, Global Greengrants Fund works through networks of over 120 on-the-ground volunteer advisors to locate dynamic, effective projects in environmental justice, preservation, and policy; by year-end 2010 Greengrants will have donated $24 million to 129 developing countries. The fund aims to serve the poorest countries of the world. Poor, rural and indigenous communities not only suffer most the consequences of shifts in rainfall, rising seas, and increased climate variability, they are also the most vulnerable due to economic and environmental policies of the countries in which they live.
