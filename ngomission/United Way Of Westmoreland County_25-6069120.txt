United Way of Westmoreland County works to improve lives by mobilizing the caring power of communities. To accomplish our mission, we focus on improving three areas of community: Education (Success in Learning & Life); Income (Basic Needs & Financial Stability); and Health (Health Access & Independence). We serve all of Westmoreland County except the Mon Valley, Fayette County and southern Armstrong County.
