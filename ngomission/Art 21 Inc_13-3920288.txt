Over the past decade, ART21 has established itself as the preeminent chronicler of contemporary art and artists through its Peabody Award-winning, PBS-broadcast television series, ART21 Art in the Twenty-First Century. The nonprofit organization has used the power of digital media to introduce millions of people of all ages to contemporary art and artists and has created a new paradigm for teaching and learning about the creative process. ART21 is a nonprofit contemporary art organization dedicated to introducing broad public audiences to today's visual artists - stimulating critical reflection as well as conversation through the production of films, publications, digital resources, and educational programs. ART21 programs inspire creative thinking and educate: a new generation about contemporary art and art making; teachers about how to engage students with the art of their time; the public at large about the life of the creative mind.
