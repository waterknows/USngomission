Founded in 1986, Habitat for Humanity of Greater New Haven is dedicated to the elimination of poverty housing through the creation of homeownership opportunities for low-income, working families. Habitat builds and rehabilitates homes in the New Haven area with the goal of creating safe, affordable houses that add to the revitalization of New Haven's neighborhoods. Habitat accomplishes its mission by partnering with individuals, religious and civic organizations, local business and corporations. Habitat of Humanity offers a hand up rather than a handout to families who qualify for the homebuyers program. Approved Habitat families work side-by-side with volunteers from the community to build their house.
