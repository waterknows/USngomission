Vermont Academy was established in 1876. The Academy is a small, independent secondary school, primarily boarding in nature, whose purpose is to prepare young men and women for entrance into and success at a college or university. The Academy helps students discover their individual talents, and develops the character, strength, and skills necessary for coping effectively with the challenge of success and failure in their lives. At Vermont Academy, we devote ourselves to creating confident and independent learners through close personal attention in a unique Vermont environment. Our diverse student body, numbering 228, are from 30 states and 12 countries.
