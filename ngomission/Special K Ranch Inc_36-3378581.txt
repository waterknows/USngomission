Special K Ranch provides family oriented Christian homes, on a working ranch for adults who have developmental disabilities. Although unaffiliated, the program has a strong Christian emphasis in philosophy and practice. Special K Ranch is a place where people who have developmental disabilities live, learn, and work with loving and caring advisers who are committed to sharing their lives in this very special way. These people are learning independent living and vocational skills through participation in daily personal, household, and ranch responsibilities.
