The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, founded in 1996, seeks to improve the lives and future prospects of children and families and, in particular, to help ensure that children are born into stable, two-parent families who are committed to and ready for the demanding task of raising the next generation. Our specific strategy is to prevent teen pregnancy and unplanned pregnancy among single, young adults. We support a combination of responsible values and behavior by both men and women and responsible policies in both the public and private sectors. The National Campaign is now expanding its focus to reduce unplanned pregnancy among young adults.
