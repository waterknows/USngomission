Warren Village exists so that low-income, single parent families achieve sustainable personal and economic self-sufficiency. People who are homeless have not only lost their home, they have also lost their connection to the community. Safe and secure housing, combined with self-help services gives stranded families the opportunity to regroup and become valuable members of society. Warren Village has provided shelter to over 3,500 families since it was established in 1974 and has been cited as a national model for its combination of housing with on-site family services, Early Childhood Education and school-age programs.
