The mission of the Tulsa Day Center for the Homeless is to provide a safe, healthy environment for people who are homeless and to provide opportunities and to encourage participation for homeless people to achieve self-sufficiency. The Tulsa Day Center for the Homeless is Tulsa County's only daytime shelter for people who are experiencing homelessness. The Day Center offers a safe daytime refuge to people living on the streets of Tulsa County. Our basic human services provide immediate assistance to women, men and families in distress. While the Day Center is the only organization in Tulsa providing shelter during the day, we also provide night shelter for approximately 116 of the most vulnerable and at-risk segments of the homeless population.
