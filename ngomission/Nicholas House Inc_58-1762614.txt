Nicholas House operates a transitional housing shelter as well as scattered apartment sites for homeless families. We assist homeless families in making the transition from homelessness to self-sufficiency in a structured but home-like environment. Nicholas House is committed to assisting its families attain three goals that form the basis of self-sufficiency: earning a living wage; maintaining the physical, mental and social health of parents and children; and maintaining safe and stable housing. Nicholas House understands that providing basic subsistence - food and shelter - is necessary but not sufficient to prevent most homeless families from becoming homeless again.
