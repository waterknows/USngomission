AIDS Project Los Angeles (APLA), one of the largest non-profit AIDS service organizations in the United States, provides bilingual direct services, prevention education and leadership on HIV/AIDS-related policy and legislation. Marking 25 years of service in 2008, APLA is a community-based, volunteer-supported organization with local, national and global reach. In 2007, more than 9,600 people accessed APLA's direct services and education programs. APLA reaches close to 600,000 people through our publications and Web sites, while countless others benefit from our education programs, social marketing campaigns and community forums. Through our policy work, we help shape legislation to provide access to life-saving HIV/AIDS drugs and care for people who rely on government programs for support.
