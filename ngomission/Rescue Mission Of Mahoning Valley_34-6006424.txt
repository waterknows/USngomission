Founded in 1893, the purpose of the Rescue Mission of Mahoning Valley is to serve and glorify God through Christ-centered outreach of love and compassion that responds to the physical, emotional, and spiritual needs of disadvantaged men, women, and children without regard to race, color or creed. In the last ten years, we've served over 1,300,000 meals to those in need. But just as importantly, we house, feed, counsel and educate hundreds each year through our residential program, helping them to get back on their feet and become productive again. They commit to turning their lives around, and we help them fulfill that commitment. We enable, encourage and equip people to improve their lives and ultimately, our community.
