Founded in 1994, the RAFT (Resource Area for Teaching) mission is to help educators transform a child's learning experience through hands-on education to inspire the joy and discovery of learning. We provide educators and community groups with creative ideas, materials, and training to promote hands-on learning in science, math, technology, and art. To learn 21st century skills - critical thinking, creative problem solving, and collaboration - students need to be actively engaged in solving meaningful problems. RAFT connects thousands of educators with the inspiration and affordable resources students need to work, think, innovate and learn creatively.
