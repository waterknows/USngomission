Founded in 2001, the Accelerated Cure Project for Multiple Sclerosis is a national organization dedicated to curing multiple sclerosis (MS) by determining the cause of MS. We believe the route to finding the cure will most quickly come from determining the cause or causes of MS. The causes will be found by developing a logical, organized, straight-forward process based on what is known about the causes of disease in general. This process must be clearly spelled out and presented in a manner that is accessible to those involved: researchers, clinicians, and individuals with MS.
