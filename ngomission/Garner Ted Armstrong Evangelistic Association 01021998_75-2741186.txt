Garner Ted Armstrong Evangelistic Association teaches and propagates the gospel according to Jesus Christ, worldwide. We provide church services sending the message of the gospel through personal appearance campaigns and via electronic media such as radio and television. We establish other organizations, such as the Intercontinental Church of God, which enhance the purpose of this evangelistic association. We also provide free information via books, pamphlets, audio and video tapes and internet connection about the gospel and Jesus Christ, and world happenings related to the Bible.
