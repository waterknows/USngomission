Family Life Ministries provides programs, services and facilities that minister to the physical, mental, social and spiritual needs of the family via radio, video, public events and the printed page. Like any Bible-based ministry, our purpose is to spread the Gospel of Christ. As Family Life, we make this our mission by strengthening families and individuals with the Christian faith. Our main purpose is supporting the family as a whole, but also caring for and paying special attention to the individual, since healthy people make up healthy families. We use Christian radio, youth programming, adult services, personal counseling, and the performing arts as ways of talking to people about Christ.
