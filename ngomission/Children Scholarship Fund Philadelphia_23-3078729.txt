The Children's Scholarship Fund Philadelphia (CSFP) is a privately-funded program, established in 1998, whose mission is to broaden educational opportunities for K-8th grade students from low-income families in Philadelphia by providing them with tuition assistance. These four-year scholarships are need-based and awarded by random lottery. Currently, approximately 3,500 children have a CSFP scholarship to attend a private, parochial or other tuition-based community school. CSFP has awarded over 10,500 scholarships chosen from 115,000 applications in the last thirteen years.
