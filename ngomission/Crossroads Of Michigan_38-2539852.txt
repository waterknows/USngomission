Crossroads of Michigan is a social service outreach agency with two locations in Detroit. Founded in 1971, Crossroads exists to support the community at large by providing emergency assistance, advocacy, and counseling to anyone in need. Acting in partnership with many other agencies, parishes, hospitals, companies and organizations in the metro area, Crossroads offers assistance in the form of a hand-up. We work with our clients to meet their immediate needs and help them assess their situations to lessen the likelihood of future problems. Our efforts are funded by foundations, individuals, and friends who are committed to bringing hope to those living on the edge of despair.
