YWCA Greater Cleveland, established in 1868, is a unique and vital community resource in Northeast Ohio committed to eliminating racism and empowering women. Although the YWCA is committed to the empowerment of women, our organization is not comprised of only women -- or serving only women. The YWCA has women and men as members, volunteers, supporters and leaders of the organization. Our programs serve women and men, young adults, adolescents and children. We also provide services to other nonprofit organizations and the business community.
