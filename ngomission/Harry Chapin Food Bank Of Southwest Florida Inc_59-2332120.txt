The mission of our organization is to overcome hunger in Charlotte, Collier, Glades, Hendry, and Lee counties through education and by working in a cooperative effort with affiliated agencies in the procurement and distribution of food, equitably and without discrimination. Southwest Florida's fragile economy has left many more families and communities unserved and underserved. In response, our operational expansion and success depend on our ability to increase the amount of food we can provide to our 150-plus partner agencies. The partner agencies we serve include church food pantries, neighborhood centers, low-income housing sites, senior nutrition centers, family crisis centers, soup kitchens, emergency shelters, after-school programs, day care centers, rehabilitation facilities, and disaster relief agencies. Collectively, these agencies provide nutritious food to more than 30,000 people each month.
