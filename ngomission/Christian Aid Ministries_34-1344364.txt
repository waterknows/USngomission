Christian Aid Ministries (CAM) was founded in 1981. Our primary purpose is to provide a trustworthy, efficient channel for Amish, Mennonite, and other conservative Anabaptist groups and individuals to minister to physical and spiritual needs around the world. Annually, CAM distributes approximately 15-20 million pounds of food, clothing, medicines, seeds, Bibles and other Christian literature. The main purpose of giving material aid is to encourage God's people and to help bring the Gospel to a lost and dying world. CAM has staff, bases and distribution networks in Romania, Moldova, Ukraine, Haiti, Nicaragua, Liberia and Israel. Through our International-Crisis program, we also help victims of war, famine, and natural disasters throughout the world.
