Vision House was incorporated in 1990 to provide safe and confidential transitional housing and services for homeless single mothers and their children, and separately for homeless men recovering from drug and alcohol addiction. Over 950 men, women and children have benefited from Vision House services. Our mission is to assist the poor and homeless and help them transform their lives, maintaining quality housing and programs for our residents while providing healing, hope and the opportunity to rebuild their lives.
