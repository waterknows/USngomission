Founded in 1958, United Way of Union County works to bring neighbors together to improve lives. Together with our Member Agencies and other community partners, we're working to meet the basic needs of our neighbors and to enhance the quality of life for all in Union County. More than just a fundraiser, United Way collaborates with local businesses, government, non-profits, and individuals to solve pressing social service issues - large and small. From working to establish a safety net for those in danger of losing their housing to ensuring that children have the opportunity to participate in recreational activities, United Way is at the forefront of making an impact in areas that need it the most.
