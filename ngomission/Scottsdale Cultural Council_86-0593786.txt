Incorporated in 1987, The Scottsdale Cultural Council presents art. We do this by making the arts an integral part of the Scottsdale experience, by offering opportunities for residents and visitors to experience the highest quality the world has to offer in performing and visual arts, and by identifying emerging artistic talent and providing a place for its expression. While it may be convenient to think of us as just a theater or a museum, our mission extends far beyond the walls of any single building or specific event. We present opportunities to both renew our understandings of traditional arts and to invent fresh meanings of unconventional arts.
