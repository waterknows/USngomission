Friends of the High Line works to build and maintain an extraordinary public park on the High Line. We seek to preserve the entire historic structure, transforming an essential piece of New York's industrial past. We provide over 70 percent of the High Line's annual operating budget and are responsible for maintenance of the park, pursuant to a license agreement with the New York City Department of Parks & Recreation. Through stewardship, innovative design and programming, and excellence in operations, we cultivate a vibrant community around the High Line.
