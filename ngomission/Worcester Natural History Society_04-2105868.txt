Founded in 1825 as the Worcester Lyceum of Natural History, EcoTarium works to contribute to a better world by inspiring a passion for science and nature through discovery. Our transition from the New England Science Center to the EcoTarium in 1998 refocused the museum on its roots in the natural sciences with a focus on hands-on exploration and discovery. EcoTarium is on the forefront of bringing science and nature education to schoolchildren in grades K-12. Each year, the museum serves thousands of schoolchildren from across the region and strives to provide unique and exciting avenues to explore science and nature inside the classroom and out.
