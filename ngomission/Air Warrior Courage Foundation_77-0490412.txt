The Air Warrior Courage Foundation (AWCF) was formed by military aviators to "care for our own." We work closely with the Red River Valley Fighter Pilots Association to do that. We focus on active duty, guard, reserve and retired military personnel and their families needing financial assistance for medical, educational, and other extraordinary expenses not covered by other military, veterans', or charitable institutions.
