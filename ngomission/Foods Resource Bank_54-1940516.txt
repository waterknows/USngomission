As a Christian response to world hunger, Foods Resource Bank (FRB) links the grassroots energy and commitment of the U.S. agricultural community with the capability and desire of small farmers in developing countries to grow lasting solutions to hunger. RB engages volunteers to raise money for between 50-60 overseas programs a year. All of the programs focus on developing small-holder agriculture, often in the most remote and poorest regions of the world. We see agriculture as the solution to hunger experienced in much of the world.
