Rebecca Farm's mission is to promote amateur equestrian competition in the western United States. The Event at Rebecca Farm has become one of the largest competitions of its kind in the United States and was an important step to competing in the 2012 London Olympics. The nation's best horses and riders compete alongside horses and riders of all ages and levels from across the continent, with free admission for spectators. The sport of Eventing is best described as an equestrian triathlon with historic military ties meant to replicate what a horse and rider would go through in the cavalry. The horse and rider compete as a partnership in all aspects of horsemanship to complete the three tests as a team, with their cumulative performance determining their final standing.
