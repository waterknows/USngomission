Make-A-Wish Foundation of the Mid-Atlantic fulfills the wishes of children facing life-threatening medical conditions to enrich the human experience with hope, strength and joy. The Foundation serves children who reside in Delaware, the District of Columbia, Maryland and Northern Virginia. Founded in 1983, the Make-A-Wish Foundation of the Mid-Atlantic, has fulfilled the wishes of more than 6,000 children fighting illnesses such as cancer, pediatric AIDS, cystic fibrosis, Duchene's muscular dystrophy and heart disease. A wish fulfilled creates a memorable experience for a child fighting a life-threatening medical condition and gives him or her something positive to think about instead of medical treatments and hospital visits.
