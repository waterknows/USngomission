For 60 years, Open Doors has worked in the world's most oppressive countries, empowering Christians who are persecuted for their beliefs. Open Doors equips persecuted Christians in more than 60 countries through programs like Bible & Gospel Development, Women & Children Advancement and Christian Community Restoration. As a result, Open Doors has specialized in helping Christians who are persecuted for their faith. However, we work with persecuted Christians to reach out to non-Christians, even their persecutors, so that they can reach them with the message of Christ.
