The Crisis Pregnancy Centers of Tucson Inc., operating as Hands of Hope Tucson, provides emotional, physical and spiritual support for pregnant women in crisis. The Hands of Hope Tucson is a Christ-Centered Ministry dedicated to protecting the unborn; providing for those facing crisis pregnancies and post abortion trauma; and promoting sexual abstinence until marriage. We provide pregnancy testing and counseling on abortion alternatives, maternal support (including clothes, furniture, and layette items), and child care. Our foundational values are a belief in the sanctity of human life; the dignity of women and motherhood; the irreplaceable value of fatherhood, the gospel of Jesus Christ and the soundness of sexual purity, marriage and family.
