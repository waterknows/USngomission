Established in 1976, James River Association works to be a guardian of the James River. We provide a voice for the river and take action to promote conservation and responsible stewardship of its natural resources. We achieve these goals through our core programs: Watershed Restoration; Education, Outreach; River Advocacy; and our Riverkeeper program.
