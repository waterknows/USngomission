Founded in 1972 in Bayside, New York, the Tourette Syndrome Association (TSA) is the only national, voluntary non-profit membership organization in this field. TSA works to identify the cause of, find the cure for and control the effects of Tourette Syndrome (TS). We offer resources and referrals to help people and their families cope with the problems that occur with TS. We raise public awareness and counter media stereotypes about TS. Today, TSA has grown into a major national health-related organization with 31 U.S. Chapters and 125 support groups. TSA funds research that will ultimately find the cause of and cure for TS and, at the same time, lead to improved medications and treatments.
