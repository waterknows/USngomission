Save-A-Pet Adoption Center, founded in 1972 by Gertrude Maxwell, is a no-kill shelter dedicated to finding loving, quality homes for each cat and dog in its care. Pets are sheltered indefinitely. Our shelter strives to create an environment which enhances both awareness of and support for the humane treatment of animals. We provide comprehensive services including: a caring and safe haven for cats and dogs, medical and behavioral assistance to mend broken spirits and bodies, adoption services, long term care for residents who are not adopted, community education, community leadership through alliances with other humane organizations, and community referral to low cost spay/neuter services.
