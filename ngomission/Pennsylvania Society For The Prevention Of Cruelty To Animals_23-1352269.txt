The Pennsylvania SPCA was the second humane organization to be founded in the United States. What makes the Pennsylvania SPCA so special? We are so much more than a shelter. Throughout the years we have been dedicated to improving the lives of Pennsylvania's animals through our core programs including:-A humane law enforcement department that enforces state laws, responding to situations of animal cruelty and neglect;-Animal shelters to house the animals we have rescued and;-A low-cost veterinary clinic providing medical and low-cost spay & neuter services to clients in the Philadelphia region.Our humane law enforcement department is one of the most active in the country rescuing thousands of animals from difficult and dangerous conditions. Our donor-funded shelter hospital provides care and treatment while our animal shelters house rescued animals while they recover from neglect and abuse and wait for a new home.
