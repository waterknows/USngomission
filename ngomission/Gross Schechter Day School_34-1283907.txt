Founded in 1980, Gross Schechter Day School works to provide children an education equally outstanding in general and Judaic studies, in an engaging, empowering environment based on Conservative Judaism, so they become committed to Jewish life and emerge as leaders in the Jewish and general communities. We enroll over 333 students in grades Pre-K through 8. Our students are repeated award-winners in regional and statewide math, science, engineering, English and geography competitions. Many of our graduates enter advanced programs in private and public high schools, become effective student leaders, and attend some of America's best colleges and universities. The school is a member of the Solomon Schechter Day School Association that began about 80 years ago.
