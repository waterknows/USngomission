The Greater St. Louis Area Council, Boy Scouts of America, is the foremost youth-serving organization in our community that develops character, citizenship, and fitness. The Council's four camps offer Scouts more than 8,000 acres of wilderness for a wide variety of outdoor programs including camping, hiking, swimming, boating, rappelling, rock climbing, ropes courses, and horseback riding. The Councils' geographic area includes 27 counties in Eastern Missouri and 10 in Southern Illinois. Approximately 56,000 young people participate in the Council's Scouting programs on an annual basis.
