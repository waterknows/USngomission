Hubbard House provides shelter and outreach services for domestic violence victims and their families. Since our beginning in 1976, we have expanded to provide free services not only for the immediate safety needs of abuse victims and their children, but also to educate, support, and promote community awareness about domestic violence and its far reaching effects in Duval and Baker counties. Hubbard House's history is rich with stories of amazing volunteer and community support, all in an effort to promote safety for victims of domestic violence and their families.
