The New York Landmarks Conservancy is dedicated to preserving, enhancing, revitalizing, and reusing architecturally significant buildings in New York City and State. Since 1973, the Conservancy has advocated for preservation in Washington, Albany, and at City Hall. Since its founding, the Conservancy has provided more than $30 million in grants and low-interest loans, accompanied by countless hours of hands-on technical consulting, to owners of historic homes, businesses, schools, houses of worship, theaters, cultural institutions, affordable housing units, and community centers. This work revitalizes neighborhoods and preserves the character of our City for future generations.
