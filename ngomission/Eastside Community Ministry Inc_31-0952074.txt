Eastside Community Ministry began in 1958 as an outreach program of Central Presbyterian Church to the youth on the east side of the city of Zanesville, Ohio. What began as a place for youth to hang out and be provided with constructive activities has, over the years, become much more. We currently offer an after school program for youth K-12 grades, an emergency food pantry, clothing bank, and emergency relief program. Eastside Community Ministry strives to meet the basic needs of those who come to us for assistance. But we are also aware that there is often a greater need than the one that is the initial reason for coming to us. Our goal is to be able to provide individual care and to listen and try to understand the underlying issues that trap people in need and poverty.
