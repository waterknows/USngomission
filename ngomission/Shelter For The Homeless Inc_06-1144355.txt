The mission of Shelter for the Homeless is to serve homeless adults in the greater Stamford, Connecticut area, including Greenwich, Darien, and New Canaan. The Shelter has three main areas of operation, emergency overnight shelter and meals for homeless men 18 years of age and older; support services for both men and women who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless, and a transitional housing facility (Berkeley House) for those ready to take the next step to longer-term, affordable housing. Our goal is to help clients to become self-sufficient and to find appropriate, longer-term housing. We offer a point of re-entry into the community for individuals who might otherwise remain homeless or displaced. The Shelter is an advocate for housing for the homeless and for the eventual elimination of homelessness.
