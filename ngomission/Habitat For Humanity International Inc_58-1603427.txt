Habitat for Humanity of Orange County, North Carolina changes lives by bringing together God's people and resources to help families in need build and own quality affordable homes. Since our start in 1984, Habitat, Orange County, has built 200 homes. Habitat for Humanity offers homeownership to Orange County families who otherwise may not have the opportunity to own a home of their own. Families pay $1,000 in closing costs and invest 325 hours of labor into building their own homes and the homes of others. With the security of a decent, safe home, Habitat families are able to turn their attention to improving other areas of their lives such as seeking more education, job training, and better employment.
