Since 1967, the Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater St. Louis, formerly the Herbert Hoover Boys & Girls Club, has been providing a safe place for children to learn and grow. Our mission is to inspire and enable youth ages 6-18 to realize their full potential as productive, responsible and caring citizens. A source of hope and opportunity for more than 3,500 youth, the Club operates at full capacity, 48 weeks a year, six days a week during the school year and five days a week during the summer. The average daily attendance is 500 youth. Football, basketball, baseball, swimming, golf, tennis, track and field, drill team and cheerleading teach youth a variety of skills, teamwork and good sportsmanship. Over the years, we have expanded beyond simply gym and swim activities.
