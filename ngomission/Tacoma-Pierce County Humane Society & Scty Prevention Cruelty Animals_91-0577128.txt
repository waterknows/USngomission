The Humane Society for Tacoma and Pierce County's mission is to protect and promote the well-being of animals and to foster positive relationships between animals and people. The Humane Society envisions a community where every pet has a permanent and loving home, every companion animal is spayed or neutered and all pets are treated with respect and compassion. We open our doors to tens of thousands of homeless pets every year and find homes for more animals than any other shelter in the state of Washington.
