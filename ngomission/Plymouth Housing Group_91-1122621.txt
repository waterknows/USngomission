Plymouth Housing Group (PHG) works to eliminate homelessness and stabilize homeless and very low-income

people in housing by preserving, developing and operating safe, decent, affordable housing, and by providing

opportunities for homeless and very low-income people to improve their lives. Founded in 1980, PHG has grown to be one of the largest providers of very low-income housing in downtown Seattle. With nearly 1,000 apartment units and 17 retail tenants in 11 buildings, PHG's comprehensive approach to providing affordable housing and supportive services has been overwhelmingly successful, earning our organization local and national recognition as a leader in the effort to end homelessness.
