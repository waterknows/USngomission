Louise Marshall founded The Cabbage Patch Settlement House in 1910, with the help from her community, church and family. The Cabbage Patch Settlement House is a Christian organization that exists to empower families and children to be self-sufficient by helping them maximize their spiritual, social, emotional, physical, moral, economic and educational potential. We foster self-esteem and responsibility through purpose-driven programs. Relationships are built, and the lives of over 1,100 at-risk children and their families are profoundly changed each year.
