Founded in 1993, EarthShare Georgia is working for the day when our air, land and water are clean, abundant and healthy. Our mission is to raise funds through employee giving for more than 60 environmental member organizations dedicated to conserving and protecting our air, land and water. Our goal is to provide critical funds to help support our non-profit environmental member organizations in a timely and efficient manner that honors the giving choices our donors make throughout the year. EarthShare Georgia also organizes three annual Earth Day events that help connect our business and environmental partners, while raising funds to help support our mission.
