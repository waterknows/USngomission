The American Spectator Foundation, founded in 1999, educates the public on new ideas, concepts and policies that favor the principles of economic freedom, individual liberty, limited government, and traditional American values. To this end, the Foundation also trains and cultivates young writers for careers in journalism and serves as a resource and an outlet for a host of both young and established conservative writers and thinkers. The Foundation is responsible for publishing "The American Spectator" which provides Americans with news and commentary on politics, economics, and culture.
