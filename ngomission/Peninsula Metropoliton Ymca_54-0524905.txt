The Peninsula Metropolitan YMCA strives to be a leading family advocate in the community, inclusive and open to all people, responsive to community needs, committed to building character, wellness and fellowship through programs which promote moral and ethical values, and bring all members of our community together for the common good. The mission of the YMCA is to put Christian principles into practice through programs that build healthy spirit, mind, and body for all. We work together with communities to provide programs like Before and After School Child Care, Preschool, Day Camps, Swimming and Swim Lessons, Family Activities, Sports for adults and children, Art programs, Health and Exercise, specialty programs for teens and older adults, and many more.
