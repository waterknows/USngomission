Established in 1972, the Group for the East End protects and restores the environment of eastern Long Island through education, citizen action and professional advocacy. We inspire people to embrace a conservation ethic. The Group was originally established as Group for America's South Fork. The Group's full-time staff of professional planners, ecologists and environmental educators bring more than 100 years of collective land use, education and public advocacy experience to the local community. The Group has an impressive record of convincing local governments to rethink major development proposals; overhaul local zoning codes; adopt new wetlands, open space and farmland preservation laws; and to invest their resources in projects that clean up local waters, conserve our beaches and protect wildlife habitats.
