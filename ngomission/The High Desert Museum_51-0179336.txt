The High Desert Museum's history began when founder Donald M. Kerr raised a wolf cub for his high school biology class. Originally founded in 1974 as the Western Natural History Institute, today the Museum remains true to Kerr's guiding principle that education and experience are the basis for thoughtful decisions. Opened in 1982, the Museum is dedicated to broadening the understanding of the High Desert's wildlife, culture, art and natural resources. In doing so, it strives to promote thoughtful decision making to sustain the region's natural and cultural heritage. Through exhibits, wildlife, and living history, the Museum creates learning experiences to help audiences discover their connection to the past, their role in the present, and their responsibility to the future.
