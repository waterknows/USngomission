Founded in 1913 by Miss Ela Hockaday, the Hockaday School is an independent college preparatory day and boarding school for girls. The School prepares girls of strong potential, pre-kindergarten through 12th grade to assume positions of responsibility and leadership in a rapidly changing world by giving them a foundation for living grounded on the traditional four cornerstones: character, courtesy, scholarship, and athletics. Hockaday offers a challenging college preparatory curriculum with Advanced Placement courses, honors courses, interdisciplinary program, and co-curricular classes with St. Mark's School of Texas, a boys' school in Dallas. The faculty consists of 118 full-time teachers and 13 part-time teachers, of whom 68 have a Master's degree, and nine hold Doctoral degrees.
