Junior Achievement is the only organization focused on economic, education and workforce development. We believe that inspiring and preparing Georgia's young people to succeed in a global economy will result in a skilled workforce that will allow Georgia's business community to flourish and grow. We strive to impact tomorrow's business and community leaders by bridging the gap between the business and education communities, encouraging Georgia's youth to set long term career goals and showing them the value of education. Our turn-key curriculum aligns to the Georgia Performance Standards, enhancing what students are learning in the classroom with real world examples and hands-on application of knowledge.
