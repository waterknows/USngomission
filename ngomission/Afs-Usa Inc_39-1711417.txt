AFS-USA works toward a more just and peaceful world by providing international and intercultural learning experiences to individuals, families, schools, and communities through a global volunteer partnership. AFS (formerly American Field Service) is a leader in intercultural learning and offers international exchange programs in more than 40 countries around the world through independent AFS Organizations, each with a network of volunteers, a professionally staffed office, and headed up by a volunteer board. Every year, close to 13,000 students, young adults and teachers choose to study abroad with AFS.
