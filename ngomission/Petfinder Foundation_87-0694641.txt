The Petfinder Foundation, a nonprofit 501(c)3 public charity, helps shelters and rescue groups save homeless pets through adoptions, disaster response and recovery and becoming more sustainable. Its mission is to ensure that no adoptable pet is euthanized for lack of a home. The Foundation provides cash, training and equipment and supplies so that hundreds of thousands of homeless pets can have happier lives and the people who work with them can do their jobs better.
