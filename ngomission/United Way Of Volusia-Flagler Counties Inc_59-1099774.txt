Founded in 1977, United Way of Volusia-Flagler Counties works to increase the organized capacity of our community to care for its people. We raise funds for our partner agencies, combining over 50 fund-raisers into one, saving the community-and our agencies-time and money that is better spent helping people. We constantly bring local volunteers and community leaders together to identify and solve local problems.
