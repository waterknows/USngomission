Fidelco Guide Dog Foundation works to breed and train high quality German shepherds for use in guiding the blind, for police work, and placement of these dogs with their blind partners. Since its beginning in 1960, this organization has reached out and touched thousands of clients' and family members' lives. Today, Fidelco is an internationally-recognized leader in the guide dog industry. The Fidelco German shepherd was created from Bavarian stock. It is an outstanding and exclusive product of selective breeding from strong working lines and has evolved to be truly a breed within a breed. Our dogs possess the characteristics of the ideal working guide: intelligence, temperament, stamina and stability.
