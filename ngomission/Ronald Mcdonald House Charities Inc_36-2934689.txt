Established in 1984, the mission of Ronald McDonald House Charities (RMHC) is to create, find and support programs that directly improve the health and well being of children. RMHC makes an immediate, positive impact on children's lives through our global network of Chapters in 52 countries and regions and through our three core programs: Ronald McDonald House, Ronald McDonald Family Room and Ronald McDonald Care Mobile. We award grants to other nonprofit organizations that align with our mission to positively impact the health and well being of children. We are also committed to education. Local Chapters award thousands of scholarships each year through RMHC U.S. Scholarships to students entering college across the United States.
