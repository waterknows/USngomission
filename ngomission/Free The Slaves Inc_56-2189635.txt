Free the Slaves liberates slaves, helps them rebuild their lives, and changes the economic, legal and social systems that allow modern slavery to exist. Free the Slaves was formed in 2000 to sound the alarm that slavery still exists, why it does, and where it is worst. We have crafted a global blueprint for change to inform governments, international institutions, faith communities, business and the public what they can do to help end slavery. We're now pilot testing community-based strategies that liberate slaves and help communities resist enslavement. We are demonstrating that our models work and will show others how to use them. Through innovative grassroots community organizing projects, rigorous evaluation and groundbreaking research, targeted advocacy, compelling communications and public engagement, Free the Slaves is showing the world that ending slavery is possible.
