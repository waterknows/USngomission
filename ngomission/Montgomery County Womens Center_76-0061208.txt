The Montgomery County Women's Center was founded in 1982. The Center has been serving the needs of victims of domestic violence, sexual assault or abuse and stalking from all areas of Montgomery County and surrounding counties for over 30 years. There are four primary program areas in which MCWC provides services at no cost: residential programs including emergency shelter and transitional housing, community educational outreach, legal services, sexual assault and counseling program. Our emergency shelter provides a safe refuge for abused women and children. The shelter can house up to 75 women and children each night. We shelter more than 800 women and children every year.
