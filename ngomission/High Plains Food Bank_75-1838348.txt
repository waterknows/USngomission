The High Plains Food Bank collects and distributes donated surplus food to agencies in the Texas Panhandle. We serve as a central clearinghouse for efficient handling of available surplus food. We collect, sort and distribute available food to non-profit agencies that then provide food to individuals, children, elderly, and handicapped in need. In 2008 we distributed 4.5 million pounds of food. The High Plains Food Bank is a part of Feeding American (formerly America's Second Harvest) a national network comprised of 205 food banks across the nation.
