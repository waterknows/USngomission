Opened in 1967, The Boys & Girls Clubs of Wake County offers young people a range of fun and educational activities. Our seven Clubs are open each day after school from 2:30 to 8:00 p.m. The Boys & Girls Clubs provides a positive and safe environment where young people can connect with trained and caring staff and reach their goals. The Boys & Girls Clubs mission is to enable all young people, especially those who need us most, to reach their full potential as productive, caring, responsible citizens. The Boys & Girls Clubs provides: a safe place to learn and grow; ongoing relationships with caring, adult professionals; life-enhancing programs and character development experiences; and hope and opportunity.
