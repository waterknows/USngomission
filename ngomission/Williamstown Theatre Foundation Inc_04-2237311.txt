The mission of the Williamstown Theatre Festival (WTF) is to produce classic and new plays with distinction and verve, provide a training program in which emerging theater talents collaborate with accomplished mentors in a vital, professional and educational atmosphere; and create and present programs that have the potential to serve and engage a diverse community. Nestled in the Berkshire Hills of western Massachusetts, WTF is a celebration of theater that brings together a vast and impressive array of artists and offers audiences varied cultural experiences. Every summer, WTF presents classic and new plays on its Main, Nikos and Center Stages, Free Theatre, Late-Night Cabaret, and readings, workshops, and other special events including a program for youngsters in North Adams called the Greylock Theatre Project.
