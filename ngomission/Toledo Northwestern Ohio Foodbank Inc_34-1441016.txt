Established in 1984, the Toledo Northwestern Ohio Food Bank, Inc. works to enable other community organizations to end hunger. We strive to maximize community resources by effectively obtaining and distributing food through a food collection and distribution system. The Food Bank currently serves more than 250 non-profit member agencies in eight counties in Northwest Ohio including Defiance, Fulton, Henry, Lucas, Ottawa, Sandusky, Wood and Williams. In effect, the Food Bank is a cooperative effort to solicit, transport, sort, repack and distribute large amounts of food and grocery products.
