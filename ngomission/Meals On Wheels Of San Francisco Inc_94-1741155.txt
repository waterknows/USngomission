Meals On Wheels San Francisco (MOWSF) exists to alleviate the food insecurity and loneliness experienced by seniors who want to stay in their own home but cannot shop or prepare meals for themselves. Our services are geared towards serving those with the greatest physical, social and economic need. The seniors we serve are frail, have limited ability to purchase or prepare meals, and have little or no support from family or caregivers. All of our clients are physically challenged due to a variety of conditions such as heart disease, cancer, vision loss, arthritis and diabetes. They are also confronted with the anxiety that the cost of living in San Francisco could outweigh their limited income. We serve more than one million meals per year.
