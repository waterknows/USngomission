Founded in 1994 by the community, KIDS Center works together with law enforcement, medical providers and social service agencies to create a supportive response to child abuse through a multi-disciplinary team approach. We serve Deschutes, Crook and Jefferson county along with the Warm Springs Reservation at our Bend center. We are a medical model child advocacy center providing evaluation and treatment services to children of abuse. We also provide prevention programs and support for families who are coming to terms with what has happened.
