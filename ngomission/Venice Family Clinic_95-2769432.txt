The mission of Venice Family Clinic (VFC) is to provide free, quality health care to people in need. Launched in 1970 by volunteer physicians Philip Rossman, MD, founder, and Mayer B. Davidson, MD, co-founder, the Clinic first operated in space borrowed from a small, store-front dental office after normal business hours. Today, VFC provides comprehensive primary health care and a range of specialty care and supportive services at eight service sites. These include medical, mental health, chronic disease management, prenatal care, early childhood development, health education and wellness, case management, dental and vision care and lab and pharmacy operations. Each year the Clinic serves about 25,000 low-income, uninsured and homeless men, women and children in nearly 89,000 medical visits in addition to 3,200 dental, 7,500 mental health and 7,800 health education visits.
