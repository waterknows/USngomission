The Humane Society of North Texas (HSNT) has been serving Tarrant and surrounding counties since 1905. HSNT's mission is to act as an advocate on behalf of all animals and to ensure their legal, moral and ethical consideration and protection; to provide for the well-being of animals who are abandoned, injured, neglected, mistreated or otherwise in need; to promote an appreciation of animals; and to instill respect for all living things. In accordance to our mission, we promote kindness, justice and mercy to every living creature entering our door. To accomplish our mission, we provide adoptions, humane investigations, animal surrender and admission, emergency rescue, a spay and neuter program, lost and found, and animal education.
