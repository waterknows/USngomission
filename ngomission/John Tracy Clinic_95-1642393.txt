John Tracy Clinic was founded in 1943 by Louise and Spencer Tracy, whose son, John, was born deaf. Our mission is to provide parent-centered services to young children with hearing loss locally and globally. JTC is the world's largest private provider of services to newborns and young children with-or at risk for-hearing loss. JTC is the only institution in Southern California to provide audiological, developmental and educational services for children with hearing loss from birth through age 5 and their parents. JTC also offers services to parents in all 50 states and more than 60 countries through distance education. JTC provides exclusively spoken-language programs so that hearing-impaired children become prepared for mainstream classrooms. JTC offers an accredited master's and credential program to help meet the national demand for auditory/oral teachers of the deaf. JTC serves 25,000 families per year.
