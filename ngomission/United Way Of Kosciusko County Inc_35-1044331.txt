The United Way of Kosciusko County is working to advance the common good by focusing on education, income and health. These are the building blocks for a good life - a quality education that leads to a stable job, enough income to support a family through retirement, and good health. Our goal is to create long-lasting changes that prevent problems from happening in the first place. We invite you to be a part of the change. Together, united, we can inspire hope and create opportunities for a better tomorrow. That's what it means to "Live United".
