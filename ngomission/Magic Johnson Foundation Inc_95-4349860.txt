The Magic Johnson Foundation, founded by Earvin “Magic” Johnson in 1991, works to develop programs and support community-based organizations that address the educational, health and social needs of ethnically diverse, urban communities. The Magic Johnson Foundation (MJF) is one of the most recognizable philanthropic organizations in the world. By providing resources, building participation, and inspiring self-sufficiency, MJF is dedicated to its vision of empowering underserved communities. The overwhelming community response to Earvin “Magic” Johnson's HIV announcement – in the form of donations and letters of support – was the force that created the organization. MJF was created to fight HIV/AIDS through grantmaking. Twenty-two years after its formation, the organization has evolved to address other powerful epidemics in urban communities, which include the lack of educational opportunity and the absence of empowerment.
