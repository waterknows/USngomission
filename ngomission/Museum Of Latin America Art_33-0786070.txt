The Museum of Latin American Art's mission is to educate the public about contemporary Latin American fine art created by artists who have lived and worked in Latin America since World War II, through the presentation of a significant permanent collection, dynamic exhibitions and related cultural and educational programs. Founded by Dr. Robert Gumbiner in November 1996, it is the only museum in the western United States that exclusively features contemporary Latin American art. Through the utilization of its permanent collection, traveling exhibitions, and programs, the Museum educates a diverse Southern California audience about contemporary Latin American art.
