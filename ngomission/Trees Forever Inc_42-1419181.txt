Founded in 1989, Trees Forever connects people to the environment through the planting and care of trees, prairie, and other natural areas. Our mission is to plant and care for trees and the environment by empowering people, building community, and promoting stewardship. To fulfill this mission, Trees Forever has developed cutting-edge programs and innovative processes, assisting community leaders with over 4,000 planting projects, involving more than 160,000 volunteers who have contributed over one million hours of their time, and helping to plant over 2.8 million trees and shrubs throughout Iowa and Illinois.
