The Walter Hoving Home is a residential spiritually-based home. We are a non-profit organization serving women ages 18 and over who have been involved in drug addiction, alcoholism, prostitution and other life-controlling problems. The 6 or 12 month program is geared to rebuilding broken lives in an atmosphere of warmth, trust, support and love. During the Home's 45-year history, a program has been developed which completely transforms the lives of the women who come directly from prison or the street. The primary vehicle for rehabilitation is the Learning Center curriculum. After completing the one-year curriculum, the student spends four months working at an outside job while still living at the Home.
