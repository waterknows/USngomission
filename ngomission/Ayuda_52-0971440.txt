Ayuda envisions a community where all immigrants overcome obstacles in order to succeed and thrive in the US. We pursue this vision by advocating for low-income immigrants through direct legal, social and language services, education and outreach in the Washington DC metropolitan area.Our current work areas include immigration, domestic violence/family law, human trafficking, abused and abandoned children, and assisting victims of notario fraud. This past year alone, Ayuda served individuals hailing from over 105 countries.
