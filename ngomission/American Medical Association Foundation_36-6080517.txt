The AMA Foundation is the philanthropic voice of the American Medical Association. Founded in 1950, the AMA Foundation advances public health and medical scholarship through philanthropic support of physician-directed initiatives. Our vision is to be the center of philanthropic activity that enables the medical community to help people lead healthier lives. We are committed to improving the health of Americans by increasing support for public health programs, including grants for free clinics, health education projects and health literacy tools.
