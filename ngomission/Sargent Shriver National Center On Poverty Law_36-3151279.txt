The Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law provides national leadership in advancing laws and policies that secure justice to improve the lives and opportunities of people living in poverty. We ensure that laws and policies provide people with low-income access to adequate health care, decent housing, a safety net, and opportunities to achieve their full potential. The Shriver Center achieves its mission through three interconnected programs: advocacy, communication, and training. We advocate for and serve clients directly, while also building the capacity of the nation's equal justice providers to advance justice and opportunity for their clients.
