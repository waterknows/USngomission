About Ron Hutchcraft MinistriesEstablished in 1991, Ron Hutchcraft Ministries is committed to communicating the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the lost in their language and to motivating and equipping believers to communicate Christ to the lost in their world. Through creative and innovative approaches to "spiritual rescue," the RHM team seeks to impact "hard-to-reach hearts" through media, the internet, radio broadcasts, and face to face events. Through the "A Word with You" radio broadcast, ANewStory.com web outreach, or the "On Eagles' Wings" outreach to Native American youth, the Ron Hutchcraft Ministries team is all about bringing the hope of Jesus to the lost.
