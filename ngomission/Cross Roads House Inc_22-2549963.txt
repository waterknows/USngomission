Cross Roads House opened its doors in 1982 to assist homeless individuals and families. We have since become the largest emergency and transitional shelter in New Hampshire, serving eastern New Hampshire and southern Maine. We currently house up to 96 people on any given night, and our emergency shelter is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Cross Roads House provides secure, transitional shelter and a proven program that helps our residents move with dignity and purpose to stable and decent housing.
