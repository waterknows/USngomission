The Independent Catholic Foundation for the Diocese of Altoona-Johnstown, incorporated in 1990, is an independent entity - legally separate from the Diocese of Altoona-Johnstown - committed to the long-term strength and viability of Catholic institutions within the eight-county diocese. Among its overall goals and objectives, the Independent Catholic Foundation is to: provide a source through which donors can make living and testamentary gifts to benefit their charitable objectives and sustain the works of parishes, schools, agencies, ministries and outreach programs of the diocese and other Catholic entities supported by its donors; serve as a depository for charitable funds; invest according to a prudent policy that closely balances risk versus reward with safety and provides an adequate mix of investments.
