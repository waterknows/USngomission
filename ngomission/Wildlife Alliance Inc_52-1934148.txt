Since its inception in 1994 as the Global Survival Network, the organization now known as Wildlife Alliance has worked with local governments, communities, and like-minded non-governmental organizations to implement cutting-edge programs in Southeast Asia and the Russian Far East. These programs aim to conserve the environment and stop illegal logging, poaching, and the illegal wildlife trade by directly protecting wildlife and habitats, reducing consumer demand for wildlife, and providing environmental education and legal and ecologically sustainable alternative livelihoods for local communities.
