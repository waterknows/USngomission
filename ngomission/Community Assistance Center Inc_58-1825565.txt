Community Assistance Center (CAC) works to meet basic human needs such as food, shelter, and clothing with the goals of helping individuals and families stay in their home, helping to reduce poverty and building stronger independent families and thus a more stable community. The Center does this by providing short term assistance to families or individuals facing an unexpected financial crisis, Assistance includes financial assistance (i.e. rent, utilities) and/or in-kind assistance (i.e. food, clothing, school and household supplies). We work with clients to address their immediate crisis, identify other available services or providers and guide them to CAC educational programs which offer additional skills that may help them sustain career and personal success for greater economic security.
