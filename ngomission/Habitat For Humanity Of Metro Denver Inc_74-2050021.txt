Habitat for Humanity of Metro Denver builds and sells homes to hard-working people in need of decent and affordable housing. We are an independent affiliate of Habitat for Humanity International, a non-denominational Christian housing ministry and global home-building movement. Habitat for Humanity of Metro Denver works in partnership with God and people from all walks of life to build decent, affordable homes in which people can live and grow into all that God intends. Since our founding in 1979 we have built more than 400 homes.
