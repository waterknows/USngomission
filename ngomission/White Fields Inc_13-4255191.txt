Founded in 2000, White Fields is a non-profit organization that cares for abused and neglected boys, ages 8 to 18 in custody of the Oklahoma Department of Human Services Child Welfare Division. Each resident is provided quality mental health treatment focusing on trauma recovery. The staff helps the residents in building communication, crisis management, and behavior management skills, which will lead to positive experiences in community involvement. White Fields also uses mentoring and relationship building to assist each boy in moving toward independence.
