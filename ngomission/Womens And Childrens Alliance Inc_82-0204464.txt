The Women's and Children's Alliance offers safety, healing and freedom from domestic abuse and sexual assault. For more than 20 years, the Women's and Children's Alliance (WCA) has been in the forefront of providing services to women, men and their children healing from domestic abuse and sexual assault. Since that time, the WCA's crisis program has evolved into one of the most vital, unduplicated, comprehensive programs in our community and region. The WCA is proud to be a community leader in providing these critically needed services. We've been an important community partner for more than 100 years and providing safe places for women to live has always been at the core of our mission.
