Physicians for Reproductive Health (formerly Physicians for Reproductive Choice and Health) was founded in 1992 by a small committee of concerned physicians in New York City, where we opened our first national office in 1995. Physicians for Reproductive Health unites the medical community and concerned supporters. Together, we work to improve access to comprehensive reproductive health care, including contraception and abortion, especially to meet the health care needs of economically disadvantaged patients.
