Chicago Foundation for Women raises money to fund and support organizations that help women and girls--it's all about making smarter connections between need, money and solutions. We believe that when women and girls are secure, whole communities are made better.



We are a community of people who share the excitement of giving to help women and girls thrive. We improve the lives of women and girls through grants, advocacy, leadership development, and public and grantee education. Since 1985, we have given more than 2,800 grants totaling over $18 million and helped thousands of women and girls become philanthropists.



Our grantmaking focuses on three strategies to improve women's and girls' lives: expanding economic security, ensuring freedom from violence, and enhancing access to health services and information.



We envision a world in which all women and girls have the opportunity to achieve their potential and live in safe, just and healthy communities.
