Family Foundations, originally Family Counseling Services, was founded in 1955. We strive to make sure every family in Northeast Florida has the solutions to become strong and financially stable and every child is raised in a money-wise family. We offer information, education and tools so that families can make good financial decisions. We assist families with reliable transportation so that they can get to work, school and quality child care. We teach families stronger communication and interpersonal skills.
