The Parkinson's Disease Foundation (PDF) is a leading national presence in Parkinson's disease research, education and public advocacy. We are working for the nearly one million people in the US who live with Parkinson's by funding promising scientific research to find the causes of and a cure for Parkinson's while supporting people with Parkinson's, their families and caregivers through educational programs and support services. Since its founding in 1957, PDF has funded over $80 million worth of scientific research in Parkinson's disease, supporting the work of leading scientists throughout the world.
