Friendship Bridge's mission is to provide microcredit and education to Guatemalan women so that they can create their own solutions to poverty for themselves, their families and their communities.Our vision is of a world in which empowered women eliminate poverty. Friendship Bridge (FB) has designed our Microcredit Plus program to ensure that it is accessible, relevant, and resonant to our target population -- women. We offer a dual program, microcredit and education, only to women, and we work in the rural areas using the local indigenous languages (of which there are over 20) spoken by the women in these communities.
