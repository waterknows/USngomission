Girl Scouts of West Central Florida serves more than 19,000 girls in grades K-12 and 8,000 adults annually in Citrus, Hernando, Hillsborough, Marion, Pasco, Pinellas, Polk and Sumter counties. In partnership with committed adults, girls develop qualities that will serve them all their lives - like strong values, social conscience, and conviction about their own potential and self-worth. Girl Scouting helps girls develop their full individual potential; relate to others with increasing understanding, skill and respect; develop values to guide their actions and provide the foundation for sound decision-making; and contribute to the improvement of society through their abilities, leadership skills and cooperation with others.
