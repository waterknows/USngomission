The McGaw YMCA is an open, charitable membership association that promotes growth in spirit, mind and body through programs and services for all. Founded in 1885 to "promote mental, moral, physical and social welfare," the Evanston YMCA remains true to the spirit of that mission today, although we have expanded to serve everyone in our diverse community. The Evanston YMCA was renamed the McGaw YMCA in 1984 in appreciation of a major gift from the Foster McGaw family. With more than 10,000 members, we serve an estimated 20,000 people in our community each year.
