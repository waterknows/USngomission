Common Cents, an educational organization, specializes in creating and managing service-learning programs for young people. Our signature program, is the largest school based child philanthropy program in the United States. Since 1991, children between the ages of four and 14 have been converting their natural compassion for others into action by collecting pennies and turning those pennies into grants for community organizations. The Penny Harvest shows young people they have the ability to change the world by introducing them to the power of philanthropy and service during their formative years.
