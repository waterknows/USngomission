Flying Horse Farms provides magical, transforming experiences for children with serious illnesses. Located on 200 acres in Mt. Gilead, Ohio, we serve hundreds of children and families each year - free of charge. For a week at a time, being sick takes a backseat to simply being a kid. And fun is priority number one. Flying Horse Farms is part of the SeriousFun Children's Network. Founded by Paul Newman, SeriousFun Children's Network is a growing global community of independently managed and financed camps and programs creating opportunities for children with serious illnesses and their families to reach beyond illness and discover joy, confidence and a new world of possibilities, always free of charge.
