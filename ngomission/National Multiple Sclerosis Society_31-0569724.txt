Founded in 1946, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society is a voluntary health organization guided by a single mission: to end the devastating effects of multiple sclerosis. The Ohio Valley Chapter, established in 1955, contributes to funding for the Society's research program and provides services to nearly 6,000 people living with MS and their families in a 27 county service area. The Chapter is committed to the philosophy of wellness, offering those living with MS the encouragement, materials and skills necessary to achieve and maintain meaningful, productive lifestyles. The Chapter's service programs include: self-help groups; a Helpline for referral services; counseling; therapeutic recreation; financial assistance for medical equipment; transportation and physical therapy assessments; educational programming and more.
