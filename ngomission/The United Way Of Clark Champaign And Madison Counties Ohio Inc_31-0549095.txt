The United Way of Clark, Champaign and Madison Counties is a non-profit volunteer led organization which seeks to improve the health and human service conditions in a three county region. United Way focuses on improving people's lives in four primary focus areas: health services, self-sufficiency, basic emergency services and healthy neighborhoods. Linkage to local support services is provided by 2-1-1, a program of United Way's community services division and child care connections. Founded in 1953, the organization's mission is to increase the organized capacity for people to care for one another.
