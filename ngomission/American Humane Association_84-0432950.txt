Founded in 1877, the American Humane Association is the only national organization dedicated to protecting both children and animals. Our mission is to ensure the welfare, wellness and well-being of children and animals, and to unleash the full potential of the bond between humans and animals to the mutual benefit of both. Our goal is to measurably, demonstrably and significantly increase the number of children and animals who are protected from harm - and the number of humans and animals whose lives are enriched through direct action, thought leadership, policy innovation, and expansion of proven, effective programs.
