Rappahannock United Way was formed as a voluntary organization to raise and distribute charitable contributions. An estimated 1,000 people from many segments of the Rappahannock area volunteered through the United Way to improve the social and economic well-being of residents in Caroline, King George, Spotsylvania, Stafford counties and the city of Fredericksburg. Our mission is to improve lives by mobilizing the caring power of communities. Partnering with 34 community agencies, Rappahannock United Way ensures that residents in need have access to sufficient food, housing, health care, and emergency services. United Way also invests in programs that help children and youth succeed, promote financial stability and independence, and strengthen and support families.
