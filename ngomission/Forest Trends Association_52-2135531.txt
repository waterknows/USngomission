Forest Trends seeks to shift the economic paradigm towards recognizing the value in all natural ecosystems, connecting policy-makers, businesses, communities, and investors to develop new financial tools to help carbon, biodiversity, and water markets work for conservation and sustainability. Our mission is four-fold: to expand the value of forests to society; to promote sustainable forest management and conservation by creating and capturing market values for ecosystem services; to support innovative projects and companies that are developing these markets; and to enhance the livelihoods of local communities living in and around those forests. Our goal is to have an impact on a scale that is meaningful globally and for a diverse set of stakeholders.
