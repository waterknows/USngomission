Lutheran Indian Ministries shares the Gospel of Jesus Christ with Native American Nations. God's grace compels us to help build the capacity of Native Americans to impact their communities for the sake of Christ's Kingdom. We seek to identify, recruit, equip and empower Native people to become spiritual leaders among their own people.
