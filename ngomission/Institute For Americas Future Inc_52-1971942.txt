The Institute for America's Future (IAF) is the strategy center for the progressive movement. Our goal is to forge the enduring progressive majority needed to realize the America of shared prosperity and equal opportunity that our country was meant to be. IAF is a center of research and education. IAF develops policy ideas, educational materials and outreach programs to help shape a progressive agenda primarily addressing the kitchen-table concerns faced by working families. As a key strategy center for the progressive movement, the Campaign for America's Future takes the information and analysis done by IAF and spearheads a compelling progressive agenda, coordinates progressive voices throughout the country, and incubates national campaigns to bring about lasting change.
