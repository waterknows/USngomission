The Minnesota State Fair Foundation preserves and improves the historic Minnesota State Fairgrounds, and supports State Fair agricultural, scientific and educational programs. Our priorities are to raise funds in the following areas: agriculture, arts and culture, education, environment, and history and heritage. Based on the historic 1911 Agricultural Society creed, the Foundation believes that

the Minnesota State Fair is: "a mirror of Minnesota greatness, a school for her citizens, and a place where all are welcome, entertained and experience the results of the best thought and effort in all lines of endeavor."
