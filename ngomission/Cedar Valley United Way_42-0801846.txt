Cedar Valley United Way's mission is to be a responsive leader in building caring and vital relationships throughout the Cedar Valley. Through being accountable and focused on our relationships, we will produce positive impact and yield measurable results. Our active role will add value to communities throughout the greater Cedar Valley. Cedar Valley United Way has a unique fund distribution and community planning process that calls on volunteers and staff to determine the extent of need in our community and assess each agency and program to verify its ability to provide an effective safety net for individuals and families. With careful planning, they make sure the resources at their disposal, including dollars, volunteers and in-kind services, go where they will do the most good and help make the Cedar Valley a better place to live.
