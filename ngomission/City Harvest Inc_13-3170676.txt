Now serving New York City for more than 30 years, City Harvest is the world's first food rescue organization, dedicated to feeding the city's hungry men, women, and children.This year, City Harvest will collect 46 million pounds of excess food from all segments of the food industry, including restaurants, grocers, corporate cafeterias, manufacturers, and farms. This food is then delivered free of charge to some 400 community food programs throughout New York City using a fleet of trucks and bikes. City Harvest helps feed the more than one million New Yorkers that face hunger each year.
