Founded in 1993, the Asian Pacific Environmental Network (APEN) seeks to empower low-income Asian Pacific Islander (API) communities to achieve environmental and social justice. APEN believes that the environment includes everything around us: where we live, work and play. We strive to build grassroots organizations that will improve the health, well-being and political strength of our communities. APEN currently works on three levels: direct organizing in local communities; building a network of API organizations; and working in multiracial alliances to affect regional and national social change.
