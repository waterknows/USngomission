Founded in 1922, the United Board is an historic Christian organization with a contemporary mission: we work with higher education institutions in Asia to develop leadership, collaboration and values such as justice, care for the environment, reconciliation and harmony among ethnic and religious communities, and civil society. The United Board operates as both a programmatic and grant-making organization and works in partnership with institutions of higher education in thirteen countries of Asia. The United Board is not an evangelical organization but, rather, one that works ecumenically to achieve excellence in education through projects and programs that reflect its commitment to service.
