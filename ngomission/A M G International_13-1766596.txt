Founded in 1942, AMG (Advancing the Ministries of the Gospel) International is an evangelical mission and relief agency, working in approximately 50 countries of the world. Our mission is clear: to give each person at least one opportunity to hear and respond to the gospel. At AMG, we endeavor to meet people at the point of their need whether it be hunger, sickness, or hopelessness, and show them Jesus as the only answer to the problems of this life and the only hope for eternal life. Our Christian missionary activities include children's work and relief, newspaper and magazine evangelism, radio and television evangelism, and missionary projects and support.
