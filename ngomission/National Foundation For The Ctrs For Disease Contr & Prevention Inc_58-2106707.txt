Since 1995, the CDC Foundation has made a direct and dramatic impact on public health by helping the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) do more, faster, to make the world healthier and safer. As an independent, nonprofit organization established by Congress, we offer individuals and organizations a powerful way to participate in CDC's mission. We unite a wide range of private sector partners with CDC scientists to achieve common goals. The CDC Foundation currently manages more than 200 programs in the United States and in 40 countries around the world.
