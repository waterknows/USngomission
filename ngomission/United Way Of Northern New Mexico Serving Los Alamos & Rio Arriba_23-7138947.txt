United Way of Northern New Mexico's mission is to engage human and financial resources to improve the quality of life of the people in the communities we serve in Northern New Mexico. Founded in 1954, United Way of Northern New Mexico currently provides funding to eighteen health and human service organizations. We focus our efforts in these critical areas: nurturing children and youth; strengthening families; improving health and healing; and enhancing the lives of our elders.
