Founded in 1985, Challenged Child and Friends offers a tailored and integrated experience where children with a variety of developmental delays and disabilities learn and grow in a full inclusion program with children who have typical development. Our "whole person" program utilizes the coordinated efforts of a professional team with diverse qualifications and experience. In our classroom program, children receive early education intervention with differentiated teaching. Additionally, speech, occupational and physical therapy services are offered in a variety of models that include direct treatment and collaboration with teaching staff. Students benefit from skilled nursing staff as well as family support services from a licensed social worker.
