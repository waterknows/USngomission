The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) is America's national institution for the documentation, study, and interpretation of Holocaust history, and serves as a memorial to the millions of people murdered during the Holocaust. Chartered by a unanimous Act of Congress in 1980 and located adjacent to the National Mall in Washington, DC, the USHMM strives to broaden public understanding of the history of the Holocaust through multifaceted programs: exhibitions; research and publication; collecting and preserving material evidence, art and artifacts related to the Holocaust; annual Holocaust commemorations known as Days of Remembrance; distribution of education materials and teacher resources; and a variety of public programming designed to enhance understanding of the Holocaust and related issues, including those of contemporary significance.
