In 1992, Writers Theatre was founded in order to create an environment where the written word and the nurturing of artists were the foundation of all productions. Central to this mission are three important core values, valuing text, both classic and contemporary, as the fundamental source of inspiration; creating deliberately intimate performances where audiences are face-to-face with powerful stories; and honoring the time and commitment of our artists by remaining at the forefront of industry compensation. Writers Theatre has built an award-winning repertoire and today serves as a vital and highly-regarded company in the Chicago theatre community.
