The mission of LUNGevity Foundation is to have a meaningful and immediate impact on improving lung cancer survival rates, ensure a higher quality of life for lung cancer patients, and provide a community for those impacted by lung cancer. 



In order to accomplish our mission, LUNGevity funds the most promising research into the early detection and successful treatment of lung cancer as identified by our board of leading scientists. LUNGevity also supports the largest national grassroots lung cancer network.



We hope to inspire the nation to commit to ending lung cancer.



Our vision is a world where no one dies from lung cancer. A world that LUNGevity helped to create by bringing together world-class scientific minds, passionate advocates, and an efficient and effective organization. Our vision is to unite the country in one movement to end lung cancer now.
