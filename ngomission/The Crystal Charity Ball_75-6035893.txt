Since 1952, the sole purpose of The Crystal Charity Ball has been to aid, support and make contributions to children's charities in Dallas County. As an organization independent of any national affiliation, members of The Crystal Charity Ball Committee have raised more than $82 million for more than 94 worthy beneficiaries over the past 56 years. In 2008, the 100 active members of The Crystal Charity Ball Committee committed to raise $5,159,593. These funds will support seven commendable Dallas organizations and give children hope for a healthier more productive future. In addition to the seven agencies selected as beneficiaries of the 2008 Crystal Charity Ball, The Pediatric Emergency Services Network will continue as our special multi-year signature project.
