For 90 years, United Way of York County has worked in our community to improve people lives. We started out as The York Welfare Federation, an organization that raised funds on behalf of 17 member agencies. As the United Way of York County; the mission of raising community funds remains the same, but our strategies have broadened in order to meet the growing and changing needs of people living in York County. United Way has adapted over the years and now collaborates with other public and private organizations to engage the community in addressing the complex issues facing York County. By developing initiatives that get at the root causes of these issues, United Way and its partners find solutions and fund programs that improve the lives of people in York County.
