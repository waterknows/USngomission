The Ronald McDonald House Charities (RMHC) of Pittsburgh provides temporary housing to families who must travel to the Pittsburgh area to get life-saving medical care for their children. Our goal is to provide a “home away from home” during one of the most difficult times in their lives. By providing the necessities of home, families can focus solely on the well-being of their sick child. RMHC of Pittsburgh has also partnered with Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh to provide the Care Mobile, a 40-foot vehicle designed and built specifically for the delivery of pediatric health care. The state of the art vehicle brings vital medical services to underserved communities in Western Pennsylvania.
