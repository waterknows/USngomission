Men of Valor is committed to winning men in prison to Jesus Christ and discipling them. Our purpose is to equip them to re-enter society as men of integrity becoming givers to the community rather than takers. By working with prisoners in the CCA Prison and the Charles Bass Correctional Complex, the MOV ministry teaches men how to make real changes so they can begin new lives once they are released.
