Springfield Victory Mission began in 1976 when Reverend and Mrs. Everett Cook started serving sandwiches and coffee from the back of their station wagon, as they reached out with the Gospel to homeless men and women on the town Square. Today the Mission serves the greater Springfield area as an evangelical Christian organization. Our job is to share the Gospel of Jesus Christ, as we provide families, men, women and youth with emergency, with transitional and educational services that lead to long-term rehabilitation, restoration and re-entry into society as functional, productive individuals.
