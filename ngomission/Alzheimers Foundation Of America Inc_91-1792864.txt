The Alzheimer's Foundation of America (AFA) was founded by a consortium of organizations to fill the gap that existed on a national level to assure quality of care and excellence in service to individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related illnesses, and to their caregivers and families. AFA's mission is to provide optimal care and services to individuals confronting dementia, and to their caregivers and families - through member organizations dedicated to improving quality of life. AFA believes that by raising awareness of the disease and educating healthcare professionals and the public at large, we will: help remove the stigma of the disease; lead to early detection and proper treatment; prompt greater utilization of community resources; and ultimately improve quality of life.
