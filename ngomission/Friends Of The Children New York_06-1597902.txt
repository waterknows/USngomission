Friends of the Children NY is an early intervention program that screens and selects children in kindergarten who are the most at-risk of school failure, juvenile delinquency, and early parenting.  We pair each child with a full-time youth advocate, called the "Friend," who exposes the Achievers to activities that foster positive social and emotional development. Friends of the Children NY breaks the cycle of poverty through an intensive and research based approach that empowers the Achievers with the character strength rise above their circumstances. The goal of our early and long term intervention is to get 100% of our Achievers to graduate from high school with a plan for their future, having avoided the juvenile justice system and having put off parenting until adulthood.
