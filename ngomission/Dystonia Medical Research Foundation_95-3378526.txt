The Dystonia Medical Research Foundation (DMRF) was founded in 1976. Dystonia is a movement disorder that causes the muscles to contract and spasm involuntarily. The mission of the DMRF is to advance research for more treatments and ultimately a cure; to promote awareness and education; and to support the needs and well being of affected individuals and families. Dedicated to serving the needs of all persons affected with dystonia and their families, the DMRF has grown from a small family-based foundation to a membership-driven organization of approximately 38,000 persons.
