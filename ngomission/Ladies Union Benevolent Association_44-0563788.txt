Since 1894, the Noyes Home has been a place where a child who is facing a family crisis feels safe, and can just be a child, until his or her family is able to get back on its feet. The Noyes Home is a place where a family facing eviction or the loss of employment can talk about their next steps with professionals while their children are cared for with kindness and compassion - for a few days, or a couple of weeks, while they find a solution. It's where a teen finds friendship, security and a positive environment to continue attending high school if a parent has become incarcerated or is unable to care for him.
