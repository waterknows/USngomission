reStart Inc. is an interfaith ministry with homeless persons committed to providing shelter and supportive services to homeless men, women, youth and families with the goal of helping them move toward independence and self-sufficiency and ending homelessness in our community. reStart Inc. is the outgrowth of an overnight emergency shelter established by an inter-faith group in 1981 at Grand Avenue Temple United Methodist Church in downtown Kansas City. A non-profit corporation for the purpose of serving homeless persons was created in 1984. reStart provides more than 110,000 bed nights of emergency, transitional and permanent shelter to approximately 11,000 homeless men, women, families with children and unaccompanied youth.
