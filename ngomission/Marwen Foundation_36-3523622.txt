Established in 1987, Marwen educates and inspires under-served young people through the visual arts. Marwen offers four program arms: Studio, College & Career, Alumni, and the Marwen Institute. The studio program is at the core of Marwen's mission. Each year, we offer more than 85 courses in six state-of-the-art studios. We challenge students to excel through comprehensive, in-depth instruction in a wide range of media including painting and drawing, ceramics and sculpture, printmaking, technology, and more. The Marwen Institute advances Marwen's existing work with Chicago's teachers and schools; pursues new initiatives in training Marwen staff and faculty; and directs the investigation, articulation, and dissemination of Marwen's practices.
