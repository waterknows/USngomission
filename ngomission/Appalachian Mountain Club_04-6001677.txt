Founded in 1876, the Appalachian Mountain Club promotes the protection, enjoyment, and understanding of the mountains, forests, waters, and trails of the Appalachian region. We believe these resources have intrinsic worth and also provide recreational opportunities, spiritual renewal, and ecological and economic health for the region. Because successful conservation depends on active engagement with the outdoors, we encourage people to experience, learn about, and appreciate the natural world. Our 16,000 volunteers, 450 full time and seasonal staff, and 100,000 members, supporters, and advocates are central to our mission. Our staff offers outdoor experiences and programs focused on our Maine and New Hampshire huts and lodges; our 12 chapters from Maine to Washington, D.C. offer local outdoor activities and skills workshops. Staff and volunteers maintain over 1,500 miles of trails, support our conservation policy and research efforts, and get urban and at-risk youth outdoors.
