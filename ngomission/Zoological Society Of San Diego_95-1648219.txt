Founded in 1916, the Zoological Society of San Diego (ZSSD) operates the San Diego Zoo, the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, and San Diego Zoo's Institute for Conservation Research. ZSSD is a conservation, education, and recreation organization dedicated to the reproduction, protection, and exhibition of animals, plants, and their habitats. 



The 100-acre Zoo is home to over 4,000 rare and endangered animals representing more than 800 species and subspecies. 



The Safari Park is an expansive wildlife sanctuary that is home to more than 3,500 animals representing more than 400 species. 



The Institute, the world's largest zoo-based conservation research division, is dedicated to preserving and protecting rare and endangered wildlife and habitats. Through our science and curatorial efforts, we have reintroduced many species back to their native rangelands. 



The education programs at the Zoo and Park reach more than 425,000 school children every year.
