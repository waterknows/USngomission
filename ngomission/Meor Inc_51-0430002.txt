The primary mission of MEOR Heritage Foundation is Jewish education on university campuses. MEOR has developed campus programming that is sophisticated, relevant and personal. It has created a staff of dynamic and personal scholars to be available on over 20 campuses to talk, teach and discuss with individual students. Its exciting and creative Maimonides Leadership Fellowship program creates Jewish literacy, communal bonding and develops student leaders through a ten week classroom and experiential learning curriculum. MEOR has expanded the classroom with its exciting international trips that enable students to broaden their Jewish horizons and Jewish knowledge around the globe. MEOR's programming seeks to create Jewish lives of meaning and merit and develop a new generation of leaders.
