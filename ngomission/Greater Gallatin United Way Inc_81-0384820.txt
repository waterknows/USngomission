Great Gallatin United Way's mission is to improve lives by mobilizing the caring power of our communities. We facilitate giving, advocating and volunteering to meet local human service needs and lead and convene community members to find long-term solutions. The Organization supports work, activities, and programs that are essential to building a healthy community based on Education, Income, and Health goals established by the community.
