The Kentucky Bar Foundation (KBF) serves as the charitable arm of Kentucky's legal community. KBF is committed to promoting justice and legal education for all Kentuckians. This mission is achieved through grants to programs and projects which advance the administration of justice by addressing law-related needs. KBF supports projects that: help those in need through law-related programs; provide information to the public so they can better understand the law and avail themselves of their rights under our judicial system; work to enhance and build trust in the Kentucky Bar and the legal system; and publish important works concerning the law, the legal profession and the judicial system.
