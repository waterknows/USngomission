Founded in 1922, PEN American Center (PEN) is an association of writers working to advance literature, defend free expression, and foster international literary fellowship. PEN is comprised of 4,000 professional members who represent the most distinguished writers, translators, and editors in the United States. PEN also welcomes Advocate Members who come from all parts of the literary community - booksellers, librarians, students, passionate readers - and who share PEN's ideals. PEN American Center is the U.S. branch of the world's oldest international literary and human rights organization, International PEN. Our programs promote writing and literature at every level and are founded on the belief that free expression is an essential component of every healthy society.
