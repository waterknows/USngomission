The Bicycle Transportation Alliance (BTA) creates healthy, sustainable communities by making bicycling safe, convenient and accessible. Since 1990, the BTA has worked in partnership with citizens, businesses, community groups, government agencies, and elected officials to create communities where people can meet their daily transportation needs on a bike.
