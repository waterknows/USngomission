Haverford College is committed to providing a liberal arts education in the broadest sense. This education, based on a rich academic curriculum at its core, is distinguished by a commitment to excellence and a concern for individual growth. Haverford has chosen to remain small and to foster close student/faculty relationships to achieve these objectives.Founded in 1833, one of America's leading liberal arts colleges, Haverford College is a close-knit intellectual community located on a serene campus just outside Philadelphia. Founded on the Quaker values of individual dignity, academic strength, and tolerance, we combine a rigorous academic program with an informal atmosphere of mutual respect and collaboration among students, faculty and staff. With over 100 faculty members and a coeducational student body, Haverford enrolls nearly 1,200 students each year representing a wide variety of ethnic and religious backgrounds and a wide geographic area.
