At the Children's Museum of Tacoma, our mission is to celebrate the power of play in the lifelong journey of learning. Our vision is to be a leader in our community in using play to learn, to grow, and to thrive. The Children's Museum of Tacoma was established in 1985 by parents, teachers, and community leaders dedicated to creating unique resources for families in Tacoma and the South Puget Sound Region. The Museum opened in 1986 as a non-profit organization and remained in its original downtown Tacoma location for 10 years, rotating single theme exhibits every 18-months.
