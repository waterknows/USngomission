Breakthrough Collaborative launches motivated middle-school students on the path to college and prepares older students for careers in education. A national nonprofit, Breakthrough Collaborative is devoted to preparing high-achieving middle-school students, most of whom are of color and from low-income families, to enter and succeed in college-preparatory high school programs. Breakthrough also recruits and trains outstanding high school and college students to become Breakthrough teachers and build an interest in careers as educators. Breakthrough students develop as highly motivated academic achievers who believe passionately in their ability to go to college. Breakthrough affiliates are in 24 cities across the U.S. and in Hong Kong.
