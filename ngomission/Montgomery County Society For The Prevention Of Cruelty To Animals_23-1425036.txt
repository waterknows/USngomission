The Montgomery County SPCA is dedicated to caring for unwanted, lost and abused domestic animals. Established in 1909 and chartered in 1916, the Montgomery County SPCA (in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania), has three locations. The Conshohocken facility houses the administrative offices as well as small domestic animals. The Perkiomenville facility includes a pet cemetery and horse farm along with facilities for small animals. Our newest facility for small domestic animals is in Abington. In an effort to combat the serious problem of pet overpopulation, it is our policy to spay or neuter all animals that are adopted.
