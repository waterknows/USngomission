At the Boys & Girls Club of Dane County, we inspire and enable all young people, especially those who need us the most, to realize their full potential to become productive, responsible and caring adults. We help inspire kids to dream and build the skills to achieve their dreams through quality programs in five core areas: character & leadership development, education and career development, health & life skills, the arts, and sports, fitness & recreation. The Club is open Monday through Saturday to ensure that young people have a safe and positive place to go. Each day, the lives of our members are influenced through working with trustworthy adults, certified teachers and dedicated mentors.
