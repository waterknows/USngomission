The Group of Thirty, established in 1978, is a private, international body composed of senior representatives of the private and public sectors and academia. The Group aims to deepen understanding of international economic and financial issues, to explore the international repercussions of decisions taken in the public and private sectors, and to examine the choices available to market practitioners and policymakers. The Group's members meet with select guests to discuss important economic, financial, and policy development. They reach out to a wider audience in seminars and symposia, and also enter the policy debate on important issues by publishing papers.
