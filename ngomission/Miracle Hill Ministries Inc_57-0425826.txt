Miracle Hill Ministries exists to ensure that persons most in need receive food, shelter, and compassion while hearing the gospel of Jesus Christ and becoming productive members of society. In 1937, a group of Greenville businessmen established a small rescue mission in response to the devastation caused by the Great Depression. That small mission eventually became Miracle Hill Greenville Rescue Mission. Today, the mission provides shelter for hundreds of people each year - including homeless men and their families. It is also home to a highly successful, Christ-centered, drug and alcohol treatment program, Overcomers.
