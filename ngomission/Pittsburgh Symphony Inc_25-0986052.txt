For more than 100 years, the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO) has been an essential part of Pittsburgh's cultural landscape. The PSO prides itself in artistic excellence, a rich history of the world's finest conductors and musicians, a strong commitment to the Pittsburgh region, and the cultivation of its family of constituents and households. At home in historic Heinz Hall, the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra offers sought-after subscription concerts including 22 weeks of classical concerts annually, a Pops series of seven weekends, and the Fiddlesticks Family Concert series. The PSO also performs free, educational concerts in Heinz Hall for students, and summer concerts in Allegheny County parks.
