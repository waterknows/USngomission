The National Cat Protection Society (NatCat) is a non-profit, no-kill 501(c)(3) cat shelter. We welcome owner-relinquished cats and kittens to stay in our clean and comfortable living quarters until they find a proper home. Our state-of-the-art facilities with protected access to the "outdoors" in large enclosed patio areas let them enjoy themselves without compromising their safety. NatCat has two cat shelters in Southern California: Newport Beach and Spring Valley. The trained staff and dedicated volunteers all share a tremendous love for cats and are selflessly dedicated to their well-being.
