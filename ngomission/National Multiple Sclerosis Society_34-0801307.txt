Established in 1953, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, Ohio Buckeye Chapter is an important part of a nationwide network that advances the Society's mission to achieve a world free of multiple sclerosis. We provide quality programs and services to over 10,000 Ohioans living with MS and their families in a 38-county area. Areas served include the Akron, Cleveland, Columbus and Youngstown metropolitan areas as well as all Central and Eastern Ohio counties. In addition, we contribute to funding cutting edge research into the cause and cure for MS. Nearly $10.2 million is being invested in the Ohio Buckeye Chapter area supporting 24 researchers and 27 research projects.
