The Boys & Girls Club of Burlington has been serving the children and youth of Chittenden County since 1942. The Club was started as a place for boys who needed constructive alternatives to hanging out on Burlington street corners. As the years progressed, the Club evolved its membership to include girls as well as boys from very diverse racial, economic, ethnic and religious backgrounds. Today, the Club reaches children and youth through its many programs and constant outreach activities from two locations in the Old North End of Burlington. 

The mission of the Boys and Girls Club of Burlington is to inspire and enable community youth, especially those who need us most, to realize their full potential as productive, healthy, responsible and caring citizens.
