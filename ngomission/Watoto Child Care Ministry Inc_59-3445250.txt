Watoto is a response to the cry of the orphaned and vulnerable children of Africa, whose lives have been ravaged by war and disease. Founded by Senior Pastors Gary and Marilyn Skinner, Watoto is birthed through Watoto Church, a thriving local church in Kampala, Uganda. We exist to raise the next generation of Ugandan leaders, by pursuing excellence in academic and practical skills, integrity in conduct and moral values, so each child becomes a responsible Christian and a productive citizen of Uganda. The goal is to rescue 10,000 children in Uganda by 2023 and the vision is to replicate the Watoto model all across Africa through fostering alliances and partnerships between Christian leaders in Africa and the developed world.
