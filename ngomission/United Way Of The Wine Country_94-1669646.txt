The mission of United Way of the Wine Country is to improve lives by mobilizing the caring power of our community through leadership, community engagement and effective investment. For over 40 years, we have been working with active community members, business leaders, nonprofit organizations and government agencies to address the most critical issues affecting our community. We are deeply committed to achieving lasting solutions - not just quick fixes - for people in our own backyard by supporting programs and services that directly help local people; advocating for public policy changes such as healthcare for all California children; and by helping people contribute their time and talent through volunteer opportunities.
