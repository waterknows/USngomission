The National Humane Education Society (NHES) is an animal welfare organization that has been in existence since 1948. Our mission is to foster a sentiment of kindness to animals in children and adults. We provide humane education, rescue and relief assistance for animals, as well as screened adoption services. Through the Humane Education Department, we provide educational presentations to all ages and information services to members as well as to the general public. Having passed the 50-year mark, The National Humane Education Society continues to grow and meet the ever-increasing demand to shelter, feed, provide medical attention, and find adoptive homes for abandoned and abused animals.
