The Amarillo Symphony will infuse the Amarillo Community with an unbridled enthusiasm for the performance and discovery of great orchestral music. In addition to its seven concert series, the Amarillo Symphony performs educational concerts, sponsors the Amarillo Youth Orchestra and partners with the Lone Star Ballet to present The Nutcracker. An Amarillo Symphony string quintet visits more than 40 elementary schools annually to give second and third grade students an introduction to the different string instruments. The Amarillo Youth Orchestra is a performance-based program for young instrumentalists from around the Texas Panhandle. The four orchestras offer a unique musical experience to young musicians ages 10 to 18 of different skill levels.
