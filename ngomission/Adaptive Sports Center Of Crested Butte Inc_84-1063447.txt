The Adaptive Sports Center (ASC) was founded in 1987 when President and Mrs. Carter joined a group of local residents to form the Physically Challenged Ski Program of Crested Butte. Since then, the program has evolved into the year-round, nationally recognized Adaptive Sports Center. Thanks to the support of volunteers, dedicated instructors and staff, as well as the local community, the ASC has thrived and grown from providing 33 alpine ski lessons during its first winter to becoming one of the premiere outdoor adaptive recreation programs in the world, offering more than 5,000 activities annually.
