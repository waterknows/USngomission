Founded in 1946, the National MS Society is the only volunteer-led health organization dedicated to the prevention, treatment, alleviation and cure of multiple sclerosis and the only volunteer-led MS organization that meets the standards of all major agencies that rate nonprofit groups. The Greater Delaware Valley Chapter was established in 1954 by noted Philadelphian Thacher Longstreth and is one of the largest of the Society's chapters.
