PLF envisions leaders working together to transform our communities into places of truth, beauty, goodness, justice, and human flourishing. To that end we equip, connect, and mobilize leaders to serve from every sphere of influence for the cultivation and restoration of the city.Our values are:- Community: A place of intimacy, trust, accountability and love for leaders to learn and grow.- Righteousness: A willingness to disadvantage ourselves for the advantage of others.- Integrity: The webbing together, the integration, of all things according to God's purposes for the common good.
