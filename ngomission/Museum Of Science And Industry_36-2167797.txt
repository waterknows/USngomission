The Museum of Science and Industry, Chicago (MSI), the largest science museum in the Western Hemisphere, is home to more than 35,000 artifacts and more than 400,000 square feet of hands-on experiences designed to spark scientific inquiry and creativity. Since opening our doors in 1933, we've welcomed more than 180 million guests from around the world. Our mission, to inspire the inventive genius in everyone, is realized through our world-class interactive science exhibitions. Even bigger than our mission is our vision: to inspire and motivate our children to achieve their full potential in the fields of science, technology, medicine and engineering. The Museum's Center for the Advancement of Science Education (CASE) is continually developing and facilitating science teacher education courses, youth development programs, student Learning Labs, after-school science clubs and engaging guest experiences - all ways in which MSI makes science come alive for guests of all ages.
