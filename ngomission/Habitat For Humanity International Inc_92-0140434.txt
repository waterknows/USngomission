At Habitat for Humanity Anchorage, our mission is to work in partnership with people throughout the community to build homes, build hope and change lives. We do this by building and renovating simple, decent, affordable homes and by making adequate housing a matter of conscience and action. Habitat sells its houses at cost to low-income Anchorage families and individuals with interest-free financing. We partner with families of any race, sex, age, disability, faith, familial status or national origin. HFHA Partners are mentored for success in the areas of basic home ownership skills and financial management. HFHA Partners also contribute "sweat equity" by volunteering between 250 and 500 hours of their time throughout the build year.
