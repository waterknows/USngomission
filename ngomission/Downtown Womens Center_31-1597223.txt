Founded in 1978, the Downtown Women's Center (DWC) is a nationally recognized organization that provides more than 100,000 meals, on-site and community-based housing to over 200 women, and a wide array of health, education, job readiness and other supportive services to more than 3000 homeless and very low-income women each year. The Center's mission is to provide permanent supportive housing and a safe and healthy community fostering dignity, respect, and personal stability, and to advocate ending homelessness for women. In the local Skid Row community, the Downtown Women's Center is the only resource that is singularly dedicated to serving the unique needs of women.
