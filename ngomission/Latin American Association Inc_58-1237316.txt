Established in 1972, Latin American Association (LAA) serves more than 50,000 individuals annually. Our goal is to help Latinos achieve self-sufficiency, put down roots, build a better life for themselves and their families, and contribute to strong, thriving communities. LAA's mission is to help Latino individuals and families achieve their aspirations for academic, social and economic advancement. Today, as the leading service provider for Latin Americans in metro Atlanta, the LAA offers a range of programs that guide Latinos with solutions to address their basic needs and provide them with the information and skills necessary to achieve their fullest potential. We aim to increase family stability, build skills, promote the development of Latino individuals, families and youth, and promote community involvement.
