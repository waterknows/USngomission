Founded in 1978, the Humane Society of Charlotte is working with you to create a world where there are no more homeless and unwanted animals. As a space available shelter, our policy is that all animals at the Humane Society are offered the opportunity of a safe and loving home. The Humane Society of Charlotte's mission is to bring love and hope to all animals by insuring the humane treatment of companion animals through adoption, spay/neuter and education. Our vision, all animals in safe and loving homes, will be accomplished by providing care and compassion for all animals, physically and emotionally; education and information on the humane and responsible treatment of all animals; respect for animals and people; integrity in word and deed; collaboration with the community; and being fiscally responsible and accountable to the community.
