Founded in 1987, Greater Albuquerque Habitat for Humanity (GAHH) builds community one home, one family, at a time by making it possible for low-income families to own simple, decent, affordable homes. GAHH's program not only allows low-income families to own homes, but improves the quality of participants living environment, empowers them to build financial equity, and increases their ability to focus on long-term goals not short-term crises. By investing themselves in the building process, Partner Families gain self-reliance, self-esteem and new skills. GAHH's projects also bring together and unify the community's businesses, organizations, and individuals to inspire work teams, while improving our neighborhoods and spreading understanding of problems faced by fellow community members.
