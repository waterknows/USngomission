Texas Public Radio (TPR) operates three non-commercial radio stations. KPAC 88.3 FM and KSTX 89.1 FM broadcast to San Antonio and South Central Texas and KTXI 90.1 FM broadcasts to the West Central Hill Country. Before TPR's founding in 1988 San Antonio was the last large community in the country where listeners could not find the full range of public radio programming on their radios. Now San Antonio and the nearby Hill Country are among the best places in the world to listen to the best that public radio has to offer in presentation of great musical art, in-depth news, civil discourse about issues and educational entertainment. Our pride is heightened every day when listeners and supporters tell us our programs make a major difference in their lives.
