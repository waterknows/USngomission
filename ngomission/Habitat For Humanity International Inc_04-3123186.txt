Founded in 1991, Habitat for Humanity of Greater Lowell (HFHGL) is an organization that works to strengthen families and communities through affordable homeownership opportunities. HFHGL works in partnership with corporations, like-minded community groups, faith-based organizations, and individual volunteers to develop communities with people in need by building and renovating simple, decent, energy efficient, affordable homes. Not only do Habitat families pay for their homes through a monthly mortgage, they also put in between 225 and 400 hours of sweat equity prior to becoming homeowners.
