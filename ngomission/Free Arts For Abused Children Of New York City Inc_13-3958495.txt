Founded in 1998, Free Arts NYC provides under-served children and families with a unique combination of educational arts and mentoring programs that help them to foster the self-confidence and resiliency needed to realize their fullest potential. Free Arts NYC programs inspire children to re-imagine their worlds and transform their lives through the creative arts. With the help of dedicated and caring volunteer mentors, Free Arts NYC delivers creative arts programs directly to low income, homeless, abused and neglected children. Our programs and the relationships they foster help children and families experience new levels of hope and creativity. Free Arts NYC volunteers have now served over 24,000 children and families.
