Young Women's Leadership Network helps low-income minority youth break the cycle of poverty through education. Our two critical programs provide college readiness and access to at-risk students from the 6th - 12th grades: CollegeBound Initiative, a school-based college guidance program for coed and single-sex public schools, and The Young Women's Leadership Schools, a high-performing network of all-girls public schools.

We are in the business of raising expectations, improving student performance, and inspiring leadership. Our first school, which made history and headlines, is the highly renowned and successful Young Women's Leadership School of East Harlem in New York City.
