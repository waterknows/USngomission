Founded in 1988, the International Campaign for Tibet (ICT) works to promote human rights and democratic freedoms for the people of Tibet. With offices in Washington, Amsterdam, Berlin and Brussels, ICT monitors and reports on human rights, environmental and socio economic conditions in Tibet; advocates for Tibetans imprisoned for their political or religious beliefs; works with governments to develop policies and programs to help Tibetans; secures humanitarian and development assistance for Tibetans; mobilizes individuals and the international community to take action on behalf of Tibetans; and promotes self-determination for the Tibetan people through negotiations between the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama.
