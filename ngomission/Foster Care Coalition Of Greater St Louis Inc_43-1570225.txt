Founded in 1989, the Foster & Adoptive Care Coalition strives to create permanency in foster children's lives by recruiting and retaining foster/adoptive families. The Coalition is one of the area's largest recruiters of foster/adoptive homes because of our partnerships with the local media, including KSDK and 13 local newspapers. The Coalition also offers support to parents, including support groups, training, 24-hour crisis intervention, advocacy, newsletters, two resale shops, and the Little Wishes program. The Coalition consists of 38 member agencies, including the area's most-respected public and private agencies. The Coalition's staff is made up of foster/adoptive parents and child welfare professionals with a broad range of expertise.
