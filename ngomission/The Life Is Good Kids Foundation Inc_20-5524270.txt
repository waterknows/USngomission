The Life is Good Kids Foundation helps kids overcome poverty, violence, and illness by using the power of joyful play to heal and strengthen children. We support the men and women who dedicate their careers to helping children heal from the devastating impact of early childhood trauma. We provide a continuum of personal and professional development resources that help childcare professionals tap into the power of optimism and build healing, life-changing relationships with children in their care. Our initiative is based on the belief that in order to better care for the most vulnerable children, we must better support those who care for them.
