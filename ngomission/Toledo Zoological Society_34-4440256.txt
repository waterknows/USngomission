In 1900, a single woodchuck was donated to the City of Toledo's Parks Board. From that small act of generosity, The Toledo Zoo emerged. The Toledo Zoo is now widely regarded as one the finest zoological institutions in the nation. Our mission is to inspire others to join us in caring for animals and conserving the natural world. The Zoo's animal collection consists of more than 6,000 animals representing over 760 species. The popularity of the Zoo has increased dramatically over the last twenty years. Restored facilities, new exhibits and a concerted effort to address the needs of the visitor have resulted in an average attendance of 875,000 people each year.
