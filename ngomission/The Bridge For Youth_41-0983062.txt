Founded in 1972, The Bridge for Youth is dedicated to providing the connection between the current realities of homelessness and a brighter, safer, more stable future. The Bridge is a safe and welcoming place for youth ages 10-17 in the Twin Cities who have no one to turn to, nowhere to go. The Bridge develops approaches that help youth and their families resolve their conflicts and move toward healthier relationships. Each year we serve more than a thousand young people and families with a continuum of services, including a 24-hour hotline; crisis shelter and counseling; youth, parent, and family counseling; transitional programs; and ongoing support services.
