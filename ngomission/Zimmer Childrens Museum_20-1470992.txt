The Zimmer Children's Museum's mission is to make a better society through interactive learning, creative self-expression and art experiences for children and families. We are dedicated to teaching people about the BIG IDEAS of global citizenship, community responsibility, and cultural sensitivity. The Zimmer Children's Museum is a non-profit cultural institution located on Museum Row in Los Angeles, and features hands-on exhibits for children 0-8 to explore BIG IDEAS in creative and inspiring settings. The Zimmer is also the only museum dedicated specifically to kids and families in Los Angeles. Through the power of play, children will learn about human values such as respect for others, helping those in need, generosity, and creativity.
