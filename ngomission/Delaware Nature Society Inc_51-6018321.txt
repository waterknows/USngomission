Founded in 1964, the Delaware Nature Society (DNS) is the pre-eminent non-profit environmental organization in the state. DNS is unique in the way it integrates education as a vital element in its role in preservation, conservation and advocacy. Currently, thousands of members support this important work and/or participate in programs while over 1,000 volunteers assist the 33 member core staff and interns so that annual programs continue to improve and increase. DNS works to foster understanding, appreciation, and enjoyment of the natural world through education; to preserve ecologically significant areas; and to advocate stewardship and conservation of natural resources.
