The FoodBank of Monmouth and Ocean Counties, provides access to food for as many people in need as possible in our neighborhoods. The FoodBank began in 1984 when three people saw hunger at the Jersey shore and decided to make a difference. They purchased a small, dilapidated warehouse in Spring Lake. After one year, the FoodBank was serving 25 charities with 100,000 pounds of food. Today, the FoodBank serves over 270 pantries, soup kitchens and other feeding programs with over four million pounds of food annually. The FoodBank also operates a Culinary Training Program for people in need of better-paid jobs, a Kids Caf√© and Backpack program for children, a Mobile Pantry, and Food Stamp Outreach Program.
