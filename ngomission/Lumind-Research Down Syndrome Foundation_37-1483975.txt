The mission of theLuMind Research Down Syndrome Foundation is to stimulate biomedical research that will accelerate the development of treatments to significantly improve cognition, including memory, learning and speech, for individuals with Down syndrome. This will allow individuals with Down syndrome to participate more successfully in school, lead to more active and independent lives, as well as avoid the early onset Alzheimer's Disease. LuMind only supports research that focuses on understanding and improving cognition. Moreover, LuMind only supports researchers and institutions that are committed to seeing their basic research translated into effective treatments. In order to increase the likelihood of a breakthrough in the treatment of Down syndrome, LuMind supports multi-disciplinary research, and encourages frequent collaboration among scientists in different fields and at different research institutions.
