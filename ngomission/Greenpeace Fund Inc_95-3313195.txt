Greenpeace Fund promotes Greenpeace's mission: to halt environmental destruction and to promote solutions for future generations. Greenpeace Fund promotes Greenpeace's mission through public education, grassroots lobbying and grants to other environmental organizations. One of Greenpeace's unique strengths is our capacity to conduct international campaigns in countries around the world, giving us the ability to challenge environmental threats and promote change on issues that transcend national borders and require international cooperation.
