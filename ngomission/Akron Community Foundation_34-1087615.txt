Akron Community Foundation was established in 1955 to improve the quality of life in the Greater Akron area by building permanent endowments and providing philanthropic leadership that enables donors to make lasting investments in the community. The vision and dedication of the greater Akron community's leaders have helped Akron Community Foundation plan for tomorrow by building a permanent, growing charitable endowment that will provide income in perpetuity. To date, assets from which income is used to support projects of many local non-profit organizations total about $138 million.
