The Myelodysplastic Syndromes Foundation (MDS Foundation) was established by an international group of physicians and researchers to provide an ongoing exchange of information relating to MDS. A major MDS Foundation effort is our international information network. This network provides patients with referrals to Centers of Excellence, contact names for available clinical trials, sharing of new research and treatment options between physicians, and extension of educational support to physicians, nurses, pharmacists and patients. In response to the needs expressed by patients, families, and healthcare professionals, we have established patient advocacy groups, research funding, and professional educational initiatives.
