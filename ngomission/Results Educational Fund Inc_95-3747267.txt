The RESULTS Educational Fund (REF) was formed to educate and engage the public about issues related to hunger, poverty and powerful citizenship. The REF also supports important research and oversight focusing on U.S. spending related to hunger and poverty domestically and internationally as well as cutting-edge research on the most effective solutions to some of the world's most urgent problems. Staff and volunteers of REF work together to educate and engage the public in issues that bear on the end of hunger and abject poverty. REF also trains people to become active citizens in a participatory democracy. We also run the Microcredit Summit Campaign.
