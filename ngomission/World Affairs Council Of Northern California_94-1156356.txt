The World Affairs Council was founded in 1947 out of the interest generated by the founding of the United Nations in San Francisco in 1945. With over 11,000 members, we are the largest international affairs organization on the West Coast. In addition to our headquarters in San Francisco's Union Square, we serve members through chapters in East Bay, Marin, Sacramento and on the Peninsula. World Affairs Council of Northern California is the largest affiliate of the World Affairs Councils of America. Our mission is to engage the public in the exploration of issues and opportunities that transcend borders. We do this by hosting events and conferences with the leaders who impact global affairs, and reaching out to students, teachers, and young professionals.
