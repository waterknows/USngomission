Little Red Door Cancer Agency strives to make the most of life and the least of cancer, by reducing the physical, emotional, and financial burdens of cancer for the medically underserved residents of central Indiana. Fighting cancer is tough enough, but it's even harder when you don't have medical insurance or the resources to afford proper care. Little Red Door provides patient services to those individuals already living with cancer, along with educational services and screenings to financially challenged individuals who benefit from early detection and risk assessment.
