"To conserve birds of prey worldwide by providing leadership in raptor conservation science and education, and by maintaining Hawk Mountain Sanctuary as a model observation, research, and education facility." Hawk Mountain is a leading voice for raptor conservation globally and operates a 2,500-acre Appalachian wildlife Sanctuary, open to the public, year round. The Sanctuary connects people to nature and the annual autumn raptor migration, and by association, raptors globally. Endowment, grants, bequests, admission fees, and membership dues support local-to-international scientific research, training, and education programs. Hawk Mountain Sanctuary is best known for its annual autumn hawkwatch, the longest-running raptor migration count in the world and, more recently, its international Conservation Science Training Program. The current strategic plan calls for a new focus on growing the conservation education program to a similar leadership level.
