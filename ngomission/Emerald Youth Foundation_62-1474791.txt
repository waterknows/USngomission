Incorporated in 1991, Emerald Youth Foundation (EYF) is a non-denominational, urban children and youth ministry located in the heart of Knoxville, Tennessee. Our ministry grew out of a vision of Emerald Avenue United Methodist Church in 1988 to serve young people in the low to moderate income community of Oakwood-Lincoln Park in North Knoxville. In 1999, EYF started a youth leadership development ministry that is now called JustLead. Our mission is to raise up a large number of just leaders who love Jesus Christ and others, maintain good health, and use their knowledge, skills, and gifts to renew their neighborhoods. Through JustLead and our other ministry opportunities, we serve young people via a growing network of urban churches.
