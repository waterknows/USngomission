The Los Angeles LGBT Center is building a world where LGBT people thrive as healthy, equal and complete members of society.Since 1969 we have cared for, championed and celebrated LGBT individuals and families in Los Angeles and beyond. Today the Center's more than 550 employees provide services for more LGBT people than any other organization in the world, offering programs, services and global advocacy that span four broad categories: Health, Social Services and Housing, Culture and Education, Leadership and Advocacy.
