Ronald McDonald House Charities of the Intermountain Area provides a temporary home-away-from-home that serves and sustains families of seriously ill children receiving treatment at area hospitals, as well as providing support to other programs that assist children in our community. Children heal faster and cope better when surrounded by their loved ones. We have been helping families for over 20 years since a group of community leaders came together to open the Ronald McDonald House in Salt Lake City in 1988.
