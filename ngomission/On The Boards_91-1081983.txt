Founded by artists in 1978, On the Boards introduces audiences to international innovators in contemporary dance, theater and music while developing and presenting new works by Northwest performing artists. Our primary activities are: the Inter/National Series, presenting artists from around the world; the Northwest Series, commissioning, producing and presenting works by artists and companies from our region; OntheBoards.tv, a video-on-demand platform presenting filmic versions of contemporary performances; the NW New Works Festival, an annual 2-week festival; and 12 Minutes Max, a monthly showcase of local artists.
