Since 1974 poor and homeless women have found an oasis of hope and nourishment at Rosie's Place. The mission of Rosie's Place is to help women maintain their dignity, seek opportunity and find security in their lives. With the help of people who believe change is possible and share our vision of justice, Rosie's Place has accomplished amazing things, both big and small. Each year: 74,000 nutritionally balanced meals are served in our warm and cheery dining room; 800 women choose free non-perishable food items and fresh produce from our groceries program each month; more than 500 women find safety and nurturing in our emergency and short-term housing; and advocates help more than 100 women find a home of their own and avoid eviction.
