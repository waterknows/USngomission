Founded in 1975, The St. Louis Park Emergency Program (STEP) strengthens the community by responding to the basic emergency needs of individuals and families in St. Louis Park. STEP is a community-wide resource which serves the basic needs of more than 1,600 people each month. STEP is more than just a food shelf; it provides a full-service resource for people in need and helps people by providing advocacy, referrals, and going the extra mile to serve those who are most vulnerable in our community.
