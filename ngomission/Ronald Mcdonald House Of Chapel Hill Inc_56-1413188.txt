The Ronald McDonald House of Chapel Hill provides a home-away-from-home for families of children who are receiving health services at area hospitals. The House offers physical comfort and emotional support through programs dedicated to the well-being of the whole family. Since opening its doors in 1988, the House has served more than 36,000 families. In mid-2015, the House will add 24,000 square feet to bring the total number of rooms to 53, including 8 two-bedroom apartments, two spacious kitchens and dining areas, two children's playroom, a game room, chapel and comfortable family rooms. A beautiful one-acre courtyard with peaceful outdoor gardens and kid-friendly play areas is at the center of the campus. The House is located just over a mile south of UNC Hospitals.
