Public Citizens for Children and Youth (PCCY) was founded over 30 years ago to help improve the lives of children by advocating on their behalf and being a catalyst for positive change. We help to identify and educate the public about children's needs and insist that our children become a priority if we as a society, and they as our future, are to survive. Our goals have always been to increase the awareness of children's needs;  increase the resources for children and families; strengthen families and communities in helping children learn and grow and assure implementation of funding of public policies which promote stable children and families.
