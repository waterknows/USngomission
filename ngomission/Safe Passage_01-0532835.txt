Founded in 1999, Safe Passage works with the poorest at-risk children of families working in the Guatemala City garbage dump. Within a safe and caring environment, we provide a comprehensive and integrated program that fosters hope, good health, educational achievement, self-sufficiency, self esteem and confidence. Our primary focus is on creating opportunities and dignity through the power of education. Since its founding, Safe Passage has grown from educating 40 children to over 500. It represents a community comprised of children and their families living at the Guatemala City dump, a dedicated local Guatemalan staff, and caring sponsors and volunteers from Guatemala and around the world.
