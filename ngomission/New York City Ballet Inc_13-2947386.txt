The New York City Ballet (NYCB), one of the foremost dance companies in the world, is unique in U.S. artistic history. Solely responsible for training its own artists and creating its own works, the New York City Ballet was the first ballet institution in the world with two permanent homes, the New York State Theater at Lincoln Center and the Saratoga Performing Arts Center in Saratoga Springs, New York. The NYCB remains dedicated to the vision of its founders as it pursues two primary objectives: to preserve the ballets, dance aesthetic, and standards of excellence created and established by its founders; and to develop new work that draws on the creative talents of contemporary choreographers and composers, and speaks to the time in which it is made.
