Ligonier Ministries is an international Christian education organization founded by theologian Dr. R.C. Sproul in 1971 to equip Christians to articulate what they believe and why they believe it. Proclaiming God's holiness is central to our purpose.To this end, we produce the Renewing Your Mind broadcasts, The Reformation Study Bible (ESV), Tabletalk devotional magazine, new books by Dr. Sproul and other contemporary authors and theologians through Reformation Trust Publishing, and produce numerous audio and video teaching series. We also offer undergraduate degrees, a Doctor of Ministry, and distance learning programs through Ligonier Academy of Biblical and Theological Studies. Ligonier hosts national, regional, and pastors conferences, and offers an online learning community in a modified virtual classroom setting with Ligonier Connect, freely broadcast 24-hour Christian internet radio (RefNet), and make available more than 3,000 unique resources through our online resource center.
