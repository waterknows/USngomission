Founded in 1970, Clean Wisconsin protects, improves, and sustains Wisconsin's clean water and air. We accomplish this through: advocating for Wisconsin's clean water and air; holding Wisconsin politicians, polluters, and regulatory agencies accountable; educating Wisconsin residents, media, and government policy makers; and forging stronger alignment across environmental advocacy groups and environmental philanthropists with interest in Wisconsin. Clean Wisconsin, an environmental advocacy organization, is the oldest and largest state group dedicated to the defense of Wisconsin's natural heritage. It is an aggressive and effective advocate working on three main fronts: lobbying, litigation, and citizen action and education.
