Founded in 1880, the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra (SLSO) is recognized internationally as an ensemble of the highest caliber, performing a broad musical repertoire with skill and spirit. The SLSO was founded on the belief that great music should be available to everyone. Through a series of innovative and nationally recognized community-oriented activities, including many education and outreach programs, the musicians of the Symphony have shared their love for music with millions and introduced classical music to those who otherwise might not have been exposed to it. Each year, Symphony musicians participate in more than 250 free performances and events throughout the greater St. Louis area.
