Founded in 1956 by John D. Rockefeller 3rd, the Asia Society is the leading global and pan-Asian organization working to strengthen relationships and promote understanding among the people, leaders, and institutions of the United States and Asia. We seek to increase knowledge and enhance dialogue, encourage creative expression, and generate new ideas across the fields of policy, business, education, arts, and culture. The Society today is a global institution - with offices throughout the US and Asia - that fulfills its educational mandate through a wide range of cross-disciplinary programming. The Society's programs address Asian American issues, the effects of globalization, and pressing concerns in Asia including human rights, the status of women, and environmental and global health issues such as HIV/AIDS.
