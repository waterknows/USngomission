The Lincoln Children's Museum invites children to create, discover, and learn through the power of play. We offers three floors and 23,300 square feet of hands-on exhibits and imaginative programs that allow children and adults to discover the adventure of learning through play together. Build, dance, play, climb, create, sing, and laugh at the Lincoln Children's Museum in Lincoln, Nebraska.
