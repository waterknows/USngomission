The Park People, created in 1969, works to preserve, enhance, and advocate for Denver's parks, recreation resources, open space, and urban forest. These efforts are accomplished primarily through two on-going programs and by raising private funds to support capital projects in Denver's parks. The Park People is home to both the Denver Digs Trees and Community Forester programs - both of which support Denver's ongoing commitment to improving the tree canopy and providing trees along public streets and parkways.
