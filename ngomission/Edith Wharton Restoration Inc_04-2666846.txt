The Mount is both an historic site and a center for culture inspired by the passions and achievements of Edith Wharton. Designed and built by Wharton in 1902, the property includes Wharton's gracious main house and expansive terrace; the historic stable, greenhouse, and gatehouse; and three acres of formal gardens surrounded by extensive woodlands. The Mount is the only monument to Edith Wharton in the United States, and one of just five percent of National Historic Landmarks dedicated to women.
