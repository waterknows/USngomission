Mercy Multiplied is a nonprofit Christian organization dedicated to helping young women break free from life-controlling behaviors and situations, including eating disorders, self-harm, drug and alcohol addictions, unplanned pregnancy, depression, sexual abuse, and sex trafficking. We hope to help every woman we serve experience God's unconditional love, forgiveness, and life-transforming power.Mercy's residential program is voluntary, biblically based, and completely free of charge to young women ages 13-28. Our goal is to help residents permanently stop destructive cycles, discover purpose for their lives, and become productive and thriving individuals. Our outreach programs and resources are based on the same biblically based, life-transforming principles used by Mercy homes.Mercy Multiplied operated under the name Mercy Ministries until October 2015, when we changed our name to reflect our outreach initiatives and commitment to "multiplying" Mercy outside our residential homes.
