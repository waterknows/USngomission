Boy Scouts of America, Trapper Trails Council prepares young people to make ethical and moral choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the scout oath and law. We provide a variety of activities to support and strengthen boy scout units and individual youth ages 8-18. Activities provided include: camping, leadership and development of skills.
