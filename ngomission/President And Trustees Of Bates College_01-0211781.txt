Bates College, widely regarded as one of the finest liberal arts colleges in the nation, is dedicated to the principle of active engagement. A 10-1 student-faculty ratio makes possible close collaborations in classroom and laboratory, and the Bates learning experience is honed through seminars, research, service-learning, and the capstone of senior thesis. Typically, two-thirds of Bates' 1,700 students study abroad. Co-curricular life is rich: most students participate in club and varsity sports; many participate in performing arts; and almost all students participate in one of more than 90 student-run clubs or organizations. Bates was founded in 1855 by Maine abolitionists, and Bates graduates have always included men and women from diverse racial, ethnic and religious backgrounds.
