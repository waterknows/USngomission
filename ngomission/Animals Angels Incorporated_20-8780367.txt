Animals' Angels Inc. focuses on improving conditions for farm animals. We work primarily in the field, trailing livestock trucks on highways, visiting markets, collecting stations and slaughterhouses. We closely cooperate with auction managers, transport companies and numerous authorities (police, veterinarians, the United States Department of Agriculture). Throughout the United States, Animals' Angels teams are there with the animals every week, conducting hands-on research and investigations.
