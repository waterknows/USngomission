At Earth Force, we have 20 years of experience working with young people, particularly those in underserved communities, to help them find their voice and assume leadership roles in building sustainable communities. Headquartered in Denver and active in over 50 communities throughout the United States and Canada, Earth Force reaches over 15,000 youth per year. Through high quality professional development and inquiry-based, hands-on learning, Earth Force's approach to youth engagement, community engagement in sustainability, and environmental stewardship helps young people build the knowledge, skills, and competencies they need for careers in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM). Students also gain stewardship behaviors that help them to be lifelong, scientifically-literate citizens.
