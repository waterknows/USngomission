Loaves & Fishes is a nondenominational organization, founded and operated by local religious congregations and community organizations. It grew out of an effort in 1975 at Holy Comforter Episcopal Church to respond to the growing hunger problem in Mecklenburg County North Carolina and continues to expand to meet that need. Loaves & Fishes provides a week's worth of nutritious groceries to individuals and families in a short-term crisis. In 2013, Loaves & Fishes provided groceries to 105,015 people.
