Founded in 1925, The Jewish Federation of Greater Washington transforms shared resources into richer lives and a stronger community. We bring people and financial resources together to advance our three-part mission: to care for those in need; to deepen engagement in Jewish life and strengthen Jewish identity; and to create connections among Jews locally, in Israel and around the world. In the Greater Washington area, Federation provides funds to partner agencies. These programs serve 110,000 Jewish households and 270,000 people throughout Northern Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia. Federation's work is imbued with the Jewish values of: arevut - mutual responsibility; tikkun olam - repairing the world; gemilut hasadim - acts of loving kindness; and tzedakah - righteousness.
