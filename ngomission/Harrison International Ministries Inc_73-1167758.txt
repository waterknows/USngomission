Harrison International is made up of three separate organizations with one common purpose and message underlying all we do - Increase! Through the teaching of Bible-based success strategies, presented in a practical and easy to understand manner, we are changing and positively impacting homes, businesses and churches around the world. Harrison International Seminars conducts marriage and financial seminars and produces and distributes tapes and books; Harrison International Ministries coordinates all activities related to church based meetings and conferences; and Christian Business Leaders International members periodically come together for times of leadership training and economic empowerment.
