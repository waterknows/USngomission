The Kentucky Museum of Art and Craft (KMAC) was founded in 1981 to promote and support art and craft excellence in Kentucky. Each year, programs benefit over 90,000 children and adults from Louisville and beyond. We have had visitors from every state and six continents. The Education Center also provides special needs workshops, summer art camps, community center programs, school partnership workshops, Girl Scout workshops, child, teen and adult workshops, and craft artist demonstrations. Kentucky, regional and national artists are featured in over 12 exhibitions per year and a Permanent Collection Gallery. Hundreds of Kentucky artists are represented in the Gallery Shop.
