At the American Psychiatric Association (APA) Foundation, we work to advance understanding of mental illnesses. We promote awareness of mental illnesses and the effectiveness of treatment, the importance of early intervention, access to care and the need for high quality services and treatment through a combination of public and professional education, research, research training, grants, and awards. Our work reaches, among others, businesses, schools and community organizations that are committed to educating the public about mental illnesses.
