UNICEF works for children in more than 190 countries and territories. Every child, no matter where they live, deserves a safe and healthy childhood. The U.S. Fund for UNICEF raises funds for UNICEF's work on child survival, child development, child protection and emergencies. We believe ZERO children should be abused, exploited or denied the right to health care, education and protection. It's an ambitious goal, but we believe that unwavering commitment is the only way to guarantee a better world for children. Your support will help us build that world.
