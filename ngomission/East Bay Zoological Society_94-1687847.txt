The Oakland Zoo, founded in 1922 by Henry Snow, has been located in its current Knowland Park location since 1936. Nestled in the rolling hills of 525-acre Knowland Park, the Zoo is home to more than 440 native and exotic animals. The mission of the zoo is to inspire respect for and stewardship of the natural world, while providing a quality visitor experience.
