Shalom Austin (formerly the Jewish Community Association of Austin) knows the Jewish people of Austin will live their best lives when they can access a vibrant, thriving community of people who share a culture of common life experiences. Shalom Austin empowers the people and organizations that make a difference in our Jewish community. We provide leadership, financial support, services, facilities and connections with people and Jewish organizations throughout Austin, Israel and the world. Shalom Austin supports four main branches, including the Jewish Community Center, Jewish Federation of Greater Austin, Jewish Family Service and the Jewish Foundation of Austin & Central Texas, who are all tasked with delivering on aspects of our promise to the Austin community.
