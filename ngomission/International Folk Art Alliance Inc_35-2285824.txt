Over the past 10 years, the International Folk Art Alliance (previously known as the Sante Fe International Folk Art Market) has expanded programs to meet the specific challenges that folk artists are facing in the global marketplace. Allied with the world's master folk artists, IFAA supports communities around the world to have clean drinking water, girls in school, improved health care and thriving folk art communities. Together, we will continue to create a world that values the humanity of the hand-made, honors timeless cultural traditions, and embraces the vision of dignified livelihoods for folk artists across the globe.
