The Grand Rapids Symphony was officially organized in 1930 and is recognized as one of America's leading regional orchestras. Our vision is for the Grand Rapids Symphony to be a more integral and indispensable part of the West Michigan community. The institution has long been an important part of the community, with musical excellence, diverse programming, collaborative spirit, and a commitment to learning all adding to the quality of life we enjoy in West Michigan. The Grand Rapids Symphony presents more than 400 performances each year, touching the lives of some 170,000. Nearly half of those who benefit are students, senior citizens and people with disabilities reached through extensive education and community service programs.
