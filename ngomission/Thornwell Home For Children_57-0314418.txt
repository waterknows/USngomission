Thornwell Home for Children is all about helping children and youth - caring for them, nurturing them, helping prepare them to become the faithful individuals God created them to be. Founded in 1875, today Thornwell is a vital ministry of the Presbyterian Church, serving children and families throughout the three-state region of the Synod of the South Atlantic - South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. Each year, Thornwell's referral network receives more than 300 calls from families in crisis; and, each year, more than 120 children find their way to our home. Most come to us battered and broken, frightened, full of sadness and despair. We offer them a safe haven; a warm, loving, family-style community in which to grow and thrive.
