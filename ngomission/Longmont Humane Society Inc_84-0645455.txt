In 1972, the Longmont Branch of the Boulder County Humane Society officially became the Longmont Humane Society. The Longmont Humane Society is an open admission facility with a mission of: Caring, serving and educating to improve the lives of companion animals. LHS provides temporary shelter to thousands of animals every year: dogs, cats, small mammals, and birds who are lost, abandoned, or surrendered. Loving attention, nutritious food, meticulous health care and daily exercise are standard parts of the high-quality care provided to each animal.
