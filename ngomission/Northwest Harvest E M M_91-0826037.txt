Northwest Harvest, founded in 1967, is Washington's only statewide non-profit food bank distributor. Our mission is to provide nutritious food to hungry people statewide in a manner that respects their dignity, while working to eliminate hunger. Our vision is that ample nutritious food is available to everyone in Washington State. Currently, 1 of every 6 people in Washington (1 of every 4 children) lives with the risk of hunger. We believe that good food bank nutrition creates a bridge from temporary crisis to stability, allowing people in need to use cash for housing, fuel, utilities, health care or child care. Last year Northwest Harvest distributed more than 26 million pounds of food - over 1.7 million meals every month - to a network of 360 food banks, meal programs and high-need schools throughout Washington.
