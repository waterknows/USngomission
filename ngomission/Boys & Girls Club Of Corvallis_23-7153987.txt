They Boys & Girls Club of Corvallis has been offering quality programs to youth grades K-12 in Corvallis and the surrounding area since 1971. We serve over 1,800 members ages 5-18, and provide outreach services to 10,000 youth across Benton County. We provide 600 free meals daily and, at our Johnson Dental Clinic, we offer oral health care to uninsured children in our community. The vision of the Boys & Girls Club of Corvallis is to be the youth organization families and youth choose for its friendly, inclusive, and fun environment, that helps school-age youth reach their full potential as productive, responsible, caring citizens.
