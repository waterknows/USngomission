ABOUT: Founded in 1983, In Defense of Animals is an international animal rights and rescue organization dedicated to protecting the rights, welfare and habitats of animals. We are supported by a network of tens of thousands of determined activists, dedicated volunteers, interns and donors. We work to expose and end animal experimentation; protect wildlife and restore balance in their natural habitats; end the exploitation and abuse of wild species living in captivity; protect domestic and wild species worldwide from abuse and slaughter for food; conduct cruelty investigations and rescue operations and provide veterinary care for sick, abused and orphaned animals in our natural habitat sanctuaries.FIGHTING APATHY, BUILDING EMPATHYIn Defense of Animals works to educate the public to fight apathy, build empathy and take concrete action to end all forms of animal exploitation worldwide. We work to ensure that decisions made involving animals, from the legislative level to the dinner table, are made with consideration of their needs and interests. We seek to redefine the role of animals in society on local, national and international levels by elevating human perception of animals from that of mere property, objects and things, to that where animals are recognized to be individuals, with feelings, needs and interests of their own. Through our work to inspire and shift the way people think about non-human beings, we believe a positive change will result in the way people treat them today and in the future.
