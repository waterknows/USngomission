The National Museum of Wildlife Art opened to the public in 1987 and moved to its current facility in 1994. Our mission is to collect, display, interpret, and preserve the highest quality North American wildlife art, supplemented by wildlife art found throughout the world. The 51,000-square-foot state-of-the-art building allows for expanded exhibition space, museum programs and educational programming, and is comprised of 14 exhibition galleries, an interactive gallery for children, a conference room, two full-size classrooms, and a 200-seat auditorium. The Museum's permanent and temporary exhibitions are augmented with innovative educational and scholarly programs emphasizing art appreciation, art history, natural science, creative writing, and American history. The Museum is an important educational center and meeting place for the Jackson Hole region.
