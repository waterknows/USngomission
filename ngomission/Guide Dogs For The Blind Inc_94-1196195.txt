Guide Dogs for the Blind provides enhanced mobility to qualified individuals through partnership with dogs whose unique skills are developed and nurtured by dedicated volunteers and a professional staff. Established in 1942, Guide Dogs for the Blind continues its dedication to quality student training services and extensive follow-up support for graduates. As the largest school serving the United States and Canada, we are able to provide highly personalized training, free of charge. The team spends up to 28 days learning to work together in a variety of real-life situations. The students learn to work their dogs in stores, restaurants and malls, and on all forms of public transportation. The class training is conducted by our licensed Guide Dog mobility instructors.
