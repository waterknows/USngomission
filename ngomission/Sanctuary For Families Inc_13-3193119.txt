Sanctuary for Families is dedicated exclusively to serving domestic violence victims and their children. Each year, Sanctuary helps thousands of victims and their children build safe lives by offering a range of high quality services to meet their complex needs. These services include clinical, legal, shelter, children's and economic stability services. Sanctuary also works to end domestic violence and its far-reaching impact through outreach, education, and advocacy. In the past year we have provided direct services to over 8,000 women and children.
