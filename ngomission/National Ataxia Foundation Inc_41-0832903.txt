The National Ataxia Foundation (NAF) was established in 1957 to help persons with ataxia and their families. The Foundation's primary purpose is to support promising ataxia research and to provide vital programs and services for ataxia families. An estimated 150,000 Americans are affected by heredity or sporadic ataxia. Ataxia can strike anyone at any time regardless of age, gender, or race. Ataxia is a group of progressive neurological diseases which affects coordination and speech. The Foundation has developed an extensive library of NAF brochures, fact sheets, books, and videos on ataxia. Also available to its members is the Foundation's quarterly news publication, Generations.
