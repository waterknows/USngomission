American Friends of Ateret Cohanim provides funding for Yeshiva Ateret Cohanim, a school of higher education in Israel. The Ateret Cohanim institutions in Israel encourage and promote study and observance of Jewish religious traditions and culture. At present, 230 students are learning in one of the Yeshiva's three institutions. The Yeshiva's 1500 graduates have established themselves in a wide variety of professions fields. Dispersed throughout the country, these men now serve as heads of educational institutions, pre-military and other yeshivot, as senior IDF officers and in key security positions. Others are active in law, media, hi-tech, management and business.
