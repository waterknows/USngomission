The Center for Health and Gender Equity (CHANGE) works to ensure that the health and population policies of international institutions promote women's reproductive and sexual health. CHANGE advocates for increased funding of voluntary family planning programs and services, exposes the detrimental effects of funding restrictions through face-to-face meetings between policy makers and women from Africa, Latin America, and Asia and trains and mobilizes U.S. grassroots leaders to be a voice for change in U.S. foreign policy debates that affect sexual and reproductive health and rights.
