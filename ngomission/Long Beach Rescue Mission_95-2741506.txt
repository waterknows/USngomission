Since 1972, the Long Beach Rescue Mission has opened its doors to thousands of men, women and children. The mission provides food, clothing, shelter and spiritual guidance to the homeless and less fortunate people of the community. The Long Beach Rescue Mission stands dedicated to helping individuals overcome the homeless cycle. We achieve long term goals and make a world of difference in today's society. The Long Beach Rescue Mission is comprised of two facilities. The Samaritan House serves as a home for men while Lydia House offers a safe haven for women and their children.
