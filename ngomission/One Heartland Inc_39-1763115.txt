Founded in 1993 and headquartered in Minneapolis, MN, and Milwaukee, WI, One Heartland runs national programs to help improve the lives of children and families facing socially isolating conditions, such as HIV/AIDS, type 2 diabetes, and youth facing homelessness and identifying as LGBTQ. At the core of One Heartland's mission are its camp programs, which include: Camp Heartland, Camp Northstar, Camp 5210, and oneFutures in Willow River, MN; Camp True Colors, New York, Texas, and Minnesota; and Camp Hollywood Heart in Malibu, CA. One Heartland also conducts the Journey of Hope national speaking program, where children affected by HIV/AIDS share their stories to educate the public and other youth about awareness and prevention. Most of One Heartland's camp experiences are offered at no cost to campers and families, as more than 75 percent of them live below the poverty line.
