In 1992, Right From The Heart Ministries began in the heart of Bryant Wright, Senior Pastor of Johnson Ferry Baptist Church in Marietta, Georgia. His vision was to share the message of Jesus Christ with people outside the traditional walls of the church and that year, with the help of people who shared his vision, the ministry broadcast its first half-hour teaching program on Christian radio in Atlanta. Later that year, the first one-minute spot aired on secular radio. In 1999, secular television spots were added to the mix, followed closely by the internet in 2000. Today, these quick hitting one-minute inspirational radio spots are played in metro Atlanta and heard throughout Georgia on the 115 stations of the Georgia News Network and the 56 stations of the Florida News Network.
