Founded in 2001, The Alliance for California Traditional Arts promotes and supports ways for cultural traditions to thrive now and into the future by providing advocacy, resources, and connections for folk and traditional artists. From Ohlone basketry and African-American quilt-making to cowboy poetry and Vietnamese opera, California is home to hundreds of diverse traditions. ACTA connects artists, communities, and funders to each other, information, and resources through grants and contracts, convenings, research, and technical assistance. ACTA also provides advocacy through local and national field-building. Recognized for its culturally competent leadership, intellectual capital, and excellence in program administration, ACTA is the California Arts Council's official partner in serving the state's folk and traditional arts field.
