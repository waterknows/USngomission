Founded in 1994, Roseland Christian Ministries (RCM) is dedicated to serving the Roseland community through our core ministries listed below. Roseland Christian Reformed Church, the worshiping body born out of RCM, partners with us to carry out the mission that God has given us to display his love to the community we are called to serve.
