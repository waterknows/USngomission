Sunny Glen Children's Home was established in 1936 with the goal of providing Christian childcare for dependent, neglected and abused children. As society changes, Sunny Glen Children's Home continuously adapts its services to meet the increasingly complex needs of future generations of children. Some of the services at Sunny Glen Children's Home includes: 24-hour supervision for children in a safe, structured group home setting, spiritual development, case management, psycho-educational group counseling, individual therapy, allied health-care services, after school tutorial programs; and a quality public school education where academic excellence is encouraged.
