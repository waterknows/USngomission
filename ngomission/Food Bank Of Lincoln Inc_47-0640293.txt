The Food Bank of Lincoln was founded in 1982 with the help of a number of concerned local citizens to help gather and distribute food to hungry people in southeast Nebraska. The Food Bank gathers, stores and redistributes surplus food, which comes from wholesalers, retailers, corporations, restaurants, civic, church and school groups, and individuals throughout our area. These donations are distributed to over 180 non-profit programs in sixteen Southeastern Nebraska counties. In 2008, the Food Bank distributed over 4.2 million pounds of food.
