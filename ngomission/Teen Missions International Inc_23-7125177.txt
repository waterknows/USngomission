Teen Missions International is a pioneer of the concept of providing short-term missions experience for teens with confidence that as young people saw the mission field first-hand they would see the pressing needs of the world. The first team went out in 1971 and since that time over 42,000 North American youth have assisted with a variety of evangelistic and building projects with over 200 established missions in over 110 countries. We exist to launch youth into lifetime missions involvement by training, discipling and mobilizing them to impact eternity around the world. A large number of our alumni are in full-time Christian ministry serving the Lord worldwide as pastors, teachers, Christian authors and missionaries.
