World Villages for Children, a project of Asian Relief, Inc., provides financial support to the charity programs of the Sisters of Mary in the Philippines, Korea, Mexico, Guatemala and Brazil. We provide food, care and education for children who, through no fault of their own, fall victim to circumstances that have far-reaching consequences for their education and living environment. We provide the children with high quality high school education along with vocational training relevant to local industries and businesses. When the children graduate from high school and leave our villages, the Sisters help them find a job as well as their own place to live. Already more than 45,000 graduates have broken free from a life of poverty and are gainfully employed. Many of our children are professionals and have continued their studies in college.
