Americans for the Arts' mission is to serve, advance, and lead the network of organizations and individuals who cultivate, promote, sustain, and support the arts in America. Americans for the Arts is the result of the merger of four (4) agencies: the National Assembly of Local Arts Agencies (NALAA); the American Council for the Arts (ACA); the Arts & Business Council (ABC); and the Business Council for the Arts (BCA). With this combined history, Americans for the Arts has served as the nation's leading nonprofit organization for advancing the arts and arts education in America for over 50 years. From offices in Washington, DC, and New York City, it now serves and leads more than 150,000 organizational and individual members and stakeholders who cultivate, promote, sustain, and support the arts in America.
