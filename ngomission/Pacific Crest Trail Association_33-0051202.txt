Founded in 1977, the mission of the Pacific Crest Trail Association is to protect, preserve and promote the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail as an internationally significant resource for the enjoyment of hikers and equestrians, and for the value that wild and scenic lands provide to all people. The Association strives to achieve this mission by: promoting the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail as a unique educational and recreation treasure and as one of the finest trails anywhere in the world; providing a broad range of services to its membership, including serving as a communications link among users and land management agencies, and publishing trail information; and assisting the U.S. Forest Service and other agencies in the maintenance and restoration of the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail.
