Clarke provides children who are deaf and hard of hearing with the listening, learning and spoken language skills they need to succeed. Annually, more than 800 children and their families benefit from programs and services at our five campus locations: Boston, Jacksonville, New York City, Northampton and Philadelphia.



Clarke impacts the lives of children and adults through educational and early childhood programs, hearing services, mainstream services, research, curriculum development and the teachers and professionals trained by Clarke who take their special skills to all parts of the world.
