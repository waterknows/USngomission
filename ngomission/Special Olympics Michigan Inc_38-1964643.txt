The mission of Special Olympics Michigan is to provide sports training and athletic competition in a variety of Olympic-type sports for the children and adults with intellectual disabilities who live in our state. Athletes are given continuing opportunities to develop physical fitness; demonstrate courage; experience joy; and participate in a sharing of gifts, skills, and friendship with their families, other Special Olympics athletes, and the community. More than 16,000 athletes participate in Special Olympics Michigan programs. Michigan has one of the largest programs in the U.S. Through Special Olympics, athletes gain self-confidence and prove their own capabilities. Special Olympics Michigan is not just training for sports--it's training for life.
