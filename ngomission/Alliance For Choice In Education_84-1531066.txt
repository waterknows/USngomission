ACE Scholarships was founded in 2000 to provide scholarships to children from low-income families in grades K-12, and to advocate for more choice for parents. With support from private individuals, corporations and foundations, ACE levels the playing field for children from low-income families by providing 50% of private school tuition, with a maximum of $2,000 per year for grades K-8 and $3,000 for high school. ACE operates in Colorado, Montana and Louisiana.
