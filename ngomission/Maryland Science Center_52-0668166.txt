The mission of the Maryland Science Center (MSC) is to create awareness of the importance of science to our lives and to stimulate people, especially children, to learn science by creating exciting educational experiences. The vision of the Maryland Science Center is to create interest in young people in science by engaging and entertaining them. As one of the most unique and important educational institutions in the region, the Science Center makes science fun; entertainment is the means and education is the end. And because of its well-earned reputation for exhibition excellence and innovative programming, the Maryland Science Center is a national model for turning on children to science. MSC traces its history back to 1797, when the Maryland Academy of Sciences, MSC's parent organization, was founded as an amateur scientific society.
