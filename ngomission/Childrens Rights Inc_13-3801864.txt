Children's Rights is a national advocacy group working to reform America's failing child welfare systems on behalf of the abused and neglected children who depend on them for protection. Since 1995, Children's Rights has been fighting to enshrine in the law of the land every child's right to be protected from abuse and neglect and to grow up in a safe, stable, permanent home. Through tough legal action complemented by substantive policy expertise, we have won landmark victories and brought about sweeping improvements in the lives of abused and neglected children in more than a dozen states across the nation.
