Grand Teton National Park Foundation provides private financial support for special projects that enhance and protect Grand Teton National Park's treasured resources. Since 1997, our organization has raised more than $20 million for education-based capital projects, work and learn programs that reconnect youth to nature, and wildlife research and protection.By funding initiatives that go beyond what the National Park Service could accomplish on its own, Foundation friends solve park challenges and create a solid future for Grand Teton.
