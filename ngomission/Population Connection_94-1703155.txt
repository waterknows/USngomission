Population Connection, formerly Zero Population Growth or ZPG, was founded in 1968 as the national grassroots population organization that educates young people and advocates progressive action to stabilize world population at a level that can be sustained by Earth's resources. Annually, our Population Education program trains 11,000 teachers and educates three million students in grades K-12 about population trends and impacts on our environment and human well-being. On Capitol Hill, we advocate for progressive policies that will help to achieve a sustainable balance between people and our planet. We influence government policies to protect and increase funding for international and domestic family planning programs; engage in teacher training and public education programs; and produce original population lesson plans and activities linked to state and national standards. We produce a quarterly magazine highlighting the links between population, health, and the environment.
