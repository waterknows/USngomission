The Diabetes Action Research and Education Foundation (Diabetes Action), founded in 1990, is committed to the prevention and treatment of diabetes and to the funding of innovative, promising research aimed at finding a cure for diabetes and diabetes related complications. Diabetes Action has provided grants to over 230 separate research studies at universities and medical institutions across the United States. Diabetes Action has also provided medical supplies to countries including Tanzania, Liberia, and Sierra Leone where the aftermath of years of civil war have left a population in continued poverty and dependent on rural clinics for medical care.
