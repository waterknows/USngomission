United Way of Mower County raises funds through an annual community drive to support programs that positively impact the county. In addition, we fund special initiatives around early childhood education, basic needs, income, health, and facilitate collaboration around important community issues. We work in close partnership with private business, government and nonprofit agencies to pinpoint and address community issues. United Way of Mower County does NOT fund agencies, but programs that directly impact individuals and families in the community.
