Incorporated in 1976, the Arkansas Sheriffs' Youth Ranches is a licensed child-care facility serving the state of Arkansas. The Ranch's program is centered on the belief that abused, neglected or abandoned children - all children for that matter - must establish a nurturing relationship with at least one caring adult to become a healthy productive adult themselves. Ranch programs include a residential child care program, an outreach program; the CASA program; the STAR program; and Speakers Bureau/Community Education/Child Abuse Awareness program. Children admitted to our residential program may remain through post-secondary education - until they are socially and financially prepared for independence and have stable employment.
