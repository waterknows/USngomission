Bridge Communities is a dynamic, grassroots organization committed to transforming the lives of homeless families through partnering with talented, resourceful individuals and groups in our community. Our program of housing, mentoring and empowering families focuses on moving them towards a goal of self sufficiency. Since its founding in 1988 Bridge Communities has become a regional and national leader in the service to homeless families, as well as the surrounding issues that lead to homelessness, such as lack of affordable housing and well-paid labor jobs. Bridge Communities has counseled and mentored many non-profits, churches and lay-person organizations on establishing a transitional housing program based on our innovative model.
