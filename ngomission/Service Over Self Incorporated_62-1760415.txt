Service Over Self exists to glorify God by proclaiming the gospel of Jesus Christ in word and deed through urban home repair camps. As a Christian camp, SOS hosts volunteers throughout the year to work with inner city homeowners to make homes warmer, safer and drier in the name of Christ. Over the years, more than 20,000 volunteers have spent time with SOS in the heart of Memphis working alongside urban homeowners. We have repaired over 700 homes. And all of this is done with the gospel at the heart of our motivation.
