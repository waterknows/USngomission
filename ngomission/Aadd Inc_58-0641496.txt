All About Developmental Disabilities (AADD), formerly Atlanta Alliance on Developmental Disabilities, was founded in 1956 and has grown from a local, grassroots organization created by a group of concerned parents, to become the State of Georgia's premiere provider of needed services, broad-based education, and effective advocacy for children, adults, and families living with developmental disabilities. The mission of AADD is to build communities of support, acceptance, and opportunity for children, adults, and families living with developmental disabilities. We work to build strong communities that encourage and support all people to: make informed choices, actively participate in activities, live in safe and positive environments, access and utilize resources, and achieve health and wellness throughout their lives.
