American Civil Liberties Union of Montana's mission is to defend, preserve, and advance civil liberties. Our vision for the future embraces the equal enjoyment of civil liberties and civil rights for all Montanans. The ACLU is our nation's guardian of liberty, working daily in courts, legislatures and communities to defend and preserve the individual rights and liberties that the Constitution and laws of the United States guarantee everyone in this country. The ACLU also works to extend rights to segments of our population that have traditionally been denied their rights, including people of color; women; lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and transgender people and prisoners.
