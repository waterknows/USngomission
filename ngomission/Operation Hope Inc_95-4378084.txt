Operation HOPE (HOPE) is the leading global provider of financial dignity education and economic empowerment programs for low- or moderate-income youth, individuals and families in underserved communities.  HOPE serves three core constituencies as articulated in our five-year Strategic Plan: Youth in underserved schools; low-income adults in underserved communities; and families who have been affected by either natural or man-made disasters. Our Mission is to expand economic opportunity in underserved communities through financial education and empowerment by offering programs that create stabilized communities and financial stakeholders. We convert check-cashing customers into banking customers, renters into homeowners, small business dreamers into small business owners, and minimum wage workers into living wage workers. Our overarching vision is financial inclusion and financial literacy leading to long-term financial dignity for all.
