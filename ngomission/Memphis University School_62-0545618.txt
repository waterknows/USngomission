Founded in 1893, Memphis University School (MUS) is a college-preparatory school dedicated to academic excellence and the development of well-rounded young men of strong moral character, consistent with the school's Christian tradition. An MUS education is characterized by a vigorous curriculum, a lively exchange of ideas, and supportive teaching. Its objective is to instruct students in the basic skills and subject matter of the humanities and sciences, to cultivate the habits and techniques of learning and athletic accomplishment, and to instill in them the highest standards of morality and conduct. Non-denominational and non-sectarian, MUS seeks to foster an appreciation of the spiritual nature of man, and honors the sincere expression of widely differing faiths.
