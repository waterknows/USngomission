Since 1962 the Union Gospel Mission has provided food, clothing, shelter and a life-changing Gospel message to the homeless and the poor of Sacramento. The Mission has grown to serve more than 9,000 meals monthly. Every night, we shelter 84 men. Our Women's Clothing Closet offers Bible study and a huge variety of essential items such as clothing, purses, shoes, and sundries to assist them with their daily needs, help them prepare for work; and for their children. We offer haircuts, mail service and showers, continuously. We provide food baskets to families and the elderly. Nightly nondenominational services and volunteer outreach programs give support for those who rarely hear an encouraging word from the Gospel. Our 9-month drug and alcohol rehabilitation program is free of charge and accommodates 24 men with a Bible structured curriculum. A vocational training and job placement program helps men find new beginnings, restoring dignity to broken lives, and providing hope.
