The Boys & Girls Clubs of South Central Kansas nurtures young people's self-esteem by instilling in them a sense of belonging, competence, power and influence, and usefulness. The clubs do this daily by providing young people with one-on-one relationships with caring adult professionals and fun, age-appropriate, well-rounded programming. Founded in 1990, the clubs provide homework assistance and tutoring, performing arts, reading, health education, computer training, character and leadership activities, entrepreneurship and sports programs for every child interested in participating. Each program area focuses on the youth development strategy of the club, and that is instilling in every child a sense of competence, belonging, power and influence and usefulness.
