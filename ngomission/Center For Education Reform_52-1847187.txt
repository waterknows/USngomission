Founded in 1993, The Center for Education Reform (CER) drives the creation of better educational opportunities for all children by leading parents, policymakers and the media in boldly advocating for school choice, advancing the charter school movement, and challenging the education establishment. Through its storehouse of data and unique insights into American communities, CER uses information to turn parents into activists, policymakers into advocates, and educators into reform leaders. The Center for Education Reform changes laws, minds and cultures to allow good schools to flourish.
