The Holy Land Christian Ecumenical Foundation (HCEF) was founded in 1999 by an ecumenical group of American Christians to preserve the Christian presence in the Holy Land. HCEF is committed to the presence and well-being of Arab Christians in the Holy land and to developing the bonds of solidarity between them and Christians elsewhere. HCEF is the primary vehicle for many churches that wish to offer spiritual and material assistance to Palestinian Christians and the Mother Church in the Holy Land. HCEF advocates for greater solidarity on the part of Western faithful with their Christian brothers and sisters in the Holy Land.
