Home For Life is an expression of a new kind of animal shelter - the long-term animal sanctuary. We provide animals with loving care, a nurturing environment that is safe and stable, a place to belong- a home for life. We provide lifetime care for cats and dogs with special needs who cannot find a home, but who can still lead a quality life. We believe that animals should live in a setting that is appropriately scaled to allow for individual attention and specialized care. This is why Home For Life is able to give its residents a quality life and not just a warehoused existence.
