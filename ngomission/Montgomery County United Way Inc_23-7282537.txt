Founded in 1955, the Montgomery County United Way (MCUW) works to improve people's lives by mobilizing the caring power of our communities. MCUW connects people who need assistance with available resources by mobilizing community time, talent, in-kind items and monetary donations. Montgomery County residents are directly impacted through the Days of Caring Projects, Hispanic Outreach Services, the Healthy Living Alliance, distribution of funds to local non-profits, and disaster response and recovery efforts.
