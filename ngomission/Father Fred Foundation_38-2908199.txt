Father Fred Foundation, began in 1989 and is a grassroots, volunteer driven, local charity that assists our neighbors in need with a wide variety of resources such as free food, clothing, furniture and financial aid. We do this without state or federal aid so our program is completely funded by community donations. Our focus is to listen, care, share and passionately support our guests with dignity and respect. Our vision is to help those who come to The Foundation seeking assistance so that no need in our community is unfulfilled. We will always honor the legacy of Father Fred by treating all people with dignity and respect, while nurturing hope and working with humility.
