Fairhaven Rescue Mission provides for the physical and spiritual needs of disadvantaged men, women, and children of Northern Kentucky. We provide housing, clothing, and food to homeless and destitute people, while teaching them how to provide for themselves. Additional services provided by Fairhaven Rescue Mission include: family emergency assistance; computer instruction; teaching living skills; reading and tutoring classes; nightly chapel services for men; weekly bible study for women; personal spiritual guidance; and home and hospital visits.
