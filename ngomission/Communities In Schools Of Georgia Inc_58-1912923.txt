Communities In Schools (CIS) is a network of nonprofit organizations focused on improving student and school success by providing needed support and services to students and schools. Our ultimate goal is to see that all students are successful in school and complete their education at least through high school. Communities In Schools of Georgia (CISGA) provides services to communities seeking to improve outcomes for students and schools in their communities. CIS provides communities with support in developing programs and services to combat the problems of school failure and dropouts in their schools. CISGA supports the work of local CIS affiliates, Performance Learning Centers and High School Graduation Coaches in Georgia.
