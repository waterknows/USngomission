The National Council for Science and the Environment (NCSE) is dedicated to improving the scientific basis for environmental decisionmaking. NCSE specializes in programs that foster collaboration between the diverse institutions and individuals creating and using environmental knowledge, including research, education, environmental, and business organizations as well as governmental bodies at all levels. We engage scientists, educators, policy-makers, environmental managers, government agencies, conservationists, and business leaders. While an advocate for science and its use, NCSE does not take positions on environmental issues. With a reputation for objectivity and non-partisanship, we are able to provide a neutral forum for all.
