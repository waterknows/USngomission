Cooperative for Education's mission is to help Guatemalan schoolchildren break the cycle of poverty through education. CoEd accomplishes this mission by implementing sustainable textbook, computer, reading, and scholarship programs in impoverished schools. Through these programs, CoEd strives to address the root causes of poverty in Guatemala, rather than merely treating its symptoms.
