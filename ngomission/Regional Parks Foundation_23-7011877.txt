The Regional Parks Foundation was established in 1969 to support the East Bay Regional Park District. The Foundation's mission is to support our Regional Parks through fundraising that provides broader public access, resource protection and preservation, education and recreational programs, and the acquisition of parklands. One of the top priorities is to ensure that underserved populations have equal access to the East Bay Regional Park District's parks, trails, programs, and services.
