Her Justice, formerly known as inMotion Inc., engages the vast talent and resources of New York City's law firms, bringing together committed lawyers and determined women to secure life-changing results.At Her Justice, we believe that all women with urgent safety and financial needs deserve legal representation. We recruit volunteer attorneys from the City's law firms to stand side-by-side with women who cannot afford to pay for a lawyer, giving them a real chance to obtain legal protections that transform their lives.
