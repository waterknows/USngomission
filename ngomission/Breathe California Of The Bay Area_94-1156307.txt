As the local lung health leader, Breathe California of the Bay Area fights lung disease in all its forms and works with its communities to protect lung health. Since 1911, organization has dedicated itself to helping all local residents breathe easier. Originally founded as the Tuberculosis Society and later working under three other names (including the American Lung Association of Santa Clara-San Benito Counties, 1970-2005), we have offered a wide array of services that address the most pressing lung health issues of our time. This includes programs to: teach kids how to manage their asthma; prevent teens from using tobacco; assist smokers who want to quit; offer support to local COPD & lung cancer patients; advocate for clean air policies; and support innovative lung disease research.
