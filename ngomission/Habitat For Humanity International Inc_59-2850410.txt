Habitat for Humanity of Hillsborough County is an official affiliate of Habitat for Humanity International. Formed in 1987, the Affiliate builds homes throughout Hillsborough County. We are a faith-based organization whose mission is to end substandard housing in Hillsborough County. Since we were founded, our affiliate has built 160 single-family homes and impacted over 200 families. With the generosity of volunteers and donors, our families earn sweat equity by working alongside them and pay an interest-free mortgage. Habitat Hillsborough's ultimate goal is to prepare our families to be successful homeowners and community contributors.
