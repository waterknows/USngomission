Maine Audubon works to conserve Maine's wildlife and wildlife habitat by engaging people of all ages in education, conservation and action. Maine Audubon's achievements include stemming the population declines of endangered least terns and piping plovers; strengthening the state endangered species act; developing Maine's first timber harvesting standards; researching ecological, recreational, timber, cultural, and economic resources in Maine's 15 million acre Northern Forest; and promoting public awareness of lake-ecology issues. Maine Audubon also provides hands-on, experiential nature programs especially designed to excite curiosity and introduce the concept of stewardship to over 8,000 students a year.
