Special Olympics Delaware (SODE) changes lives by promoting understanding, acceptance and inclusion between people with and without intellectual disabilities. We build sports skills, confidence, strength, motivation and self-esteem - not just for 3,000 athletes, but for everyone involved. The mission of Special Olympics is to provide year-round sports training and athletic competition in a variety of Olympic-type sports for children two years of age and older and adults with intellectual disability (or other significant learning or vocational problems), giving them continuing opportunities to develop physical fitness, demonstrate courage, experience joy and participate in a sharing of gifts, skills and friendship with their families, other Special Olympics athletes and the community.
