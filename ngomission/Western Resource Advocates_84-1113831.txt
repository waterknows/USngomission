Founded in 1989, Western Resource Advocates (WRA) is an environmental law and policy organization dedicated to protecting the West's land, air, and water. Our lawyers, scientists, and economists advance clean energy to reduce pollution and global climate change; promote urban water conservation and river restoration; and defend special public lands from energy development and unauthorized off-road vehicle travel. We collaborate with other conservation groups, hunters and fishermen, ranchers, American Indians, and others to ensure a sustainable future for the West.
