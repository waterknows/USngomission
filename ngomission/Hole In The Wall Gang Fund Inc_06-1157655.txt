The Hole in the Wall Gang Fund was founded by Paul Newman in 1985 to serve children and families coping with cancer and other life threatening diseases. The Fund's primary activity is the operation of The Hole in the Wall Gang Camp. The Camp, in collaboration with its associated camps in the United States and abroad, provides children with cancer and other serious illnesses and conditions a camping experience of the highest quality, while extending year-round support to their families and health care providers. In addition, the Fund provides assistance in the form of grants and financial and other support to other camps and organizations in the United States and in other countries whose mission, objectives and operations are consistent with those of the Fund.
