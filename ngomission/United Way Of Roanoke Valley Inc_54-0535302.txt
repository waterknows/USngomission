Founded in 1924, United Way of Roanoke Valley improves lives by mobilizing the caring power of people in our community. United Way serves as a catalytic force for positive community-wide change, working with our donors, volunteers, partner agencies, and other key stakeholders to build a stronger and healthier region in the 21st century. We invest in quality programs to make the following visions a reality: all of our children and youth succeed; all of our families are strong; all of our senior citizens live with respect and dignity; and all of our citizens are healthy and self-sufficient.
