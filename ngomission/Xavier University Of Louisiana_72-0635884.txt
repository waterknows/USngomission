Xavier University of Louisiana, the only historically Black, Catholic institution of higher education in the United States, was founded in 1915 in New Orleans. Today Xavier continues its traditional commitment to educate well-rounded graduates positioned to become leaders serving communities across the country and around the world. The ultimate purpose of the University is the promotion of a more just and humane society. To this end, Xavier prepares its students to assume roles of leadership and service in society. This preparation takes place in a pluralistic teaching and learning environment that incorporates all relevant educational means, including research and community service.
