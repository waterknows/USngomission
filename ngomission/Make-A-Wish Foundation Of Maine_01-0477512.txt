The Maine Chapter of Make-A-Wish opened in 1992. Founded by Wayne and Caroline Morong, in Camden, the Maine chapter has grown to serve children in each of Maine's 16 counties. As of July 2015, we have granted over 1,200 wishes. This year, the organization expects to grant the greatest wish of over 70 seriously ill Maine children, which is an average of one wish every five days.
