Founded in 2003, Operation Support Our Troops - America (formerly Operation Support Our Troops - Illinois) has been a grassroots effort that's blossomed into one of the largest volunteer based military support organizations in the country. Our mission is to support the morale and wellbeing of American forces by providing comfort, resources and education to them and their families both while they are deployed in harm's way and after their return. We accomplish this by providing a link between the citizens and military personnel so that everyone has the opportunity to express their support. This allows us to send comfort packages of items that are not readily available to our troops in their deployed locations, along with personal letters, cards and notes of support from the community at large.
