Established in 1991, The LPGA Foundation empowers and support girls and women through developmental and humanitarian golf initiatives. We aim to be a leader in improving the lives of girls and women through the game of golf. The LPGA Foundation has four main goals: to develop and maintain junior golf programs across the country; to develop and maintain scholarship programs for junior golfers; to maintain a financial assistance fund for those in the golf industry; and to conduct research and develop educational activities related to golf instruction. The LPGA-USGA Girls Golf, one of the Foundation's programs, has established The LPGA Foundation as a leader in the golf industry in youth initiatives.
