Wayside Waifs is an independent humane society and animal welfare organization established in 1944. Wayside Waifs is a charitable animal shelter whose purpose is to place adoptable companion animals in responsible homes. To accomplish this, we employ three key strategies: providing temporary shelter for homeless companion animals; educating the public; and developing partnerships, collaborations and strategic alliances.The above is our mission statement. Please note additionally: Our state-of-the-art facility is a 32,700 square foot building which can shelter up to 800 animals. In addition, Wayside offers many other services to the community including humane education for children and adults, an anti-violence humane education program for grades 3-5, a volunteer program, a seniors' program, shelter for the pets of women in domestic violence shelters, a behavior helpline for frustrated pet owners, and more.
