State Voices champions democracy because we believe America will thrive when all citizens can and do participate equally. The State Voices network supports creative ways to mobilize and empower people across the country so their voices are heard and their participation assured in the public sphere, particularly those who make up the emerging majority. Our national organization supports and convenes the 22 state tables in our network. We focus on five core areas: growing the capacity of our tables for change-making, coordinating strategies and actions between the national and state level, making data and technology accessible, mobilizing funding and resources, and movement building.
