Founded in 1990, the mission of The York Theatre Company is to be a birthplace for new literate, intimate musicals, and a place where underappreciated musical gems from the past are rediscovered; to provide support for the creators of new musical theatre and be a showcase for new musical theatre talent of all kinds; to provide students with opportunities for hands-on theatre education; and to serve the community by presenting free or low-cost musical theatre performances to under-served audiences.
