Our mission is to demonstrate the compassion of Jesus Christ toward the hungry, homeless and hurting of the greater Grand Rapids area. Since 1900, Mel Trotter Ministries has dedicated its ministry to feeding the hungry, lifting the fallen, restoring the broken and healing the hurting. Every year, thousands of women, children and men experience the love and compassion of Jesus Christ through Mel Trotter's primary services: Emergency Shelter, 4x4 Program that transitions individuals and families out of homelessness by finding them stable employment and permanent housing, Community Food Services, Public Inebriates Program and Thrift stores. At Mel Trotter, we believe God has called us to use our faith to help those in crisis. In partnership with the community, we provide hot meals, warm beds, educational opportunities, job training, dental, vision and chiropractic care, emergency food boxes, clothing, personal-care items, diapers and many other needed items.
