The Law Enforcement Education Program (LEEP) seeks to create and support educational programs for the betterment of both the general public and the law enforcement community. We do this through programs including the Project SafeKids Program, which offers free child identification CD-ROMs to concerned parents at local community events. Students on Sobriety (S.O.S) educates teens about the legal, financial and human costs of drinking and driving. Our 911 Your Friend video teaches children what to expect when they dial 911 in an emergency. We also award a scholarship for students interested in pursuing a career in Public Safety and all of its related fields.
