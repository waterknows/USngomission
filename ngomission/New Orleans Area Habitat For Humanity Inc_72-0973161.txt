New Orleans Area Habitat for Humanity (NOAHH) was founded in 1983 and is part of a growing Habitat family. NOAHH's work over the years has resulted in over one hundred homes constructed in the New Orleans Metro area. Our mission is to build houses in partnership with sponsors, volunteers, communities, and homeowner families, whereby families are empowered to transform their own lives and to eliminate poverty housing in the New Orleans area while serving as a catalyst to make decent shelter a matter of conscience and action. Through volunteer labor and tax-deductible donations of money and materials, Habitat builds simple, decent houses with the help of the homeowner Partner Families. Habitat houses are sold to Partner Families at no profit, and financed with affordable, no-interest loans.
