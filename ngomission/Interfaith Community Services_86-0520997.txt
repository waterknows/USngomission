The mission of Interfaith Community Services is to live our diverse faiths by helping seniors, disabled individuals and people in financial crisis in Pima County achieve stable and independent lives though support from volunteers, faith communities and the community-at-large. Our vision is that: seniors and disabled individuals will have transportation, meals, and caregiving services available to them so they can remain independent in their homes; people in financial crisis will have a compassionate place to turn to for vital services that help stabilize their housing, employment, and health care situations; and seniors, disabled individuals, and people in financial crisis may gain access to personal resources, social support, and information to make informed decisions.
