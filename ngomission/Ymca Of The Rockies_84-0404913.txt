YMCA of the Rockies puts Christian principles into practice through programs, staff and facilities in an environment that builds healthy spirit, mind and body for all. We will accomplish this by serving conferences of a religious, educational, or recreational nature; providing unifying experiences for families; offering traditional summer camping experiences for boys and girls; and serving our staff with leadership opportunities and productive work experiences. Our core values are: caring, honesty, respect, responsibility and faith. YMCA of the Rockies owns and operates two year-round conference and family centers: Estes Park Center, near Estes Park, Colorado, adjacent to Rocky Mountain National Park, and Snow Mountain Ranch, near Winter Park, Colorado. We also have Camp Chief Ouray, a traditional summer residential youth camp.
