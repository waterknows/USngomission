Founded in 1628 by the Reformed Protestant Dutch Church, Collegiate School is the oldest independent school in the United States. Collegiate School strives to educate each boy to reach his highest level of intellectual,

ethical, artistic, and physical development. Drawing on what is known about boys' growth and learning, the school offers a rigorous K-12 program rich in opportunities for cultivating individual talents and interests in a climate of collaboration and respect. Collegiate continues its historic tradition in New York City of educating a diverse and talented student body and of helping boys to become independent adults and responsible citizens who will lead and serve.
