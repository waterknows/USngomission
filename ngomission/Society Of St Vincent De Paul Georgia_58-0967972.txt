The Society of St. Vincent de Paul Georgia empowers people, regardless of their background, ethnicity, or faith, to achieve stability and self-sufficiency by offering financial, material, educational, and spiritual support and by collaborating with others to develop and deliver programs and services that help those in need. The work of the Society takes place through the dedicated work of Vincentians in the local Conferences. The Conference Support Center provides a variety of ongoing programs and services to the local Conferences and the local community.
