For three decades, Ronald McDonald House Charities of Central Ohio (RMHC) has been serving families with seriously ill children by providing a home-away-from-home at the Columbus Ronald McDonald House. From its beginnings as a grassroots movement established by a partnership between volunteers and local McDonald's Owner/Operators, the Charity has served thousands of families in their deepest times of need.
