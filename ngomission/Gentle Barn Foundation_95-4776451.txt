The Gentle Barn works to teach people reverence for life by rescuing, rehabilitating, and giving sanctuary to abused animals. At The Gentle Barn, we work with children from the inner-city, group homes, mental health care facilities, foster homes, and schools to teach them that even though we are all different on the outside, on the inside we are all the same and are deserving of the same rights, respects and freedom. The ultimate goal is to open Gentle Barns across the country so that every animal and child can have a place of healing and safety and where they can be seen for the perfect beings that they are. Since its inception, The Gentle Barn has been home to hundreds of animals and host to over 350,000 people.
