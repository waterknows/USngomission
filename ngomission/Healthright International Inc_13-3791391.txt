Founded in 1990 as Doctors of the World-USA, HealthRight International mobilizes the health sector to promote and protect these and other basic human rights and civil liberties for all people, in the United States and abroad. In collaboration with a network of affiliates around the world and in partnership with local communities, we work where health is diminished or endangered by violations of human rights and civil liberties. We provide essential care and services while training community residents to carry on the mission of health at the conclusion of our efforts. We combine these services with appropriate advocacy to ensure maximum impact. To achieve our goals, we mobilize health care professionals as volunteers, bringing their expertise and idealism to those who need it most.
