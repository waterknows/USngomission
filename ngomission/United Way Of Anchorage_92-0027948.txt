United Way of Anchorage (UWA) has been advancing the common good for 60 years. UWA is the leader in mobilizing the resources of individuals, companies, government and labor to achieve positive and lasting change in the lives of the people in our community. Our work is focused on the basics: education - ensuring that all children are ready for kindergarten, stay on track and graduate prepared for work, life and continued education; income - empowering families to save for the future, build assets, and increase their income levels; and health - Connecting people to affordable healthcare options and supporting healthy life choices is a community responsibility; and basic needs support - ensuring that all Anchorage families are warm, housed and fed.
