Inspired by a belief that improving our public schools was too big a task for a school district to undertake alone, the Public Education Foundation was established in 1991. The Foundation's mission is to mobilize community and global resources to support and impact public education through initiatives, programs, and promising practices designed to improve student performance and advance quality educational opportunities for all children. Our solutions to the challenges of educating a growing and diverse Southern Nevada population are impacting schools and the school district at multiple levels from grassroots classroom participation to systemic reform. Our initiatives and programs empower teachers and students, reduce bureaucracy, ensure accountability, leverage resources, and deliver results.



We are working collaboratively with educators to ensure that our students not only succeed in the classroom but succeed in life.
