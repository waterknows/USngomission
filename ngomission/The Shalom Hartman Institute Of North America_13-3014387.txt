The Shalom Hartman Institute (SHI) is a center of transformative thinking and teaching that addresses the major challenges facing the Jewish people and elevates the quality of Jewish life in Israel and around the world. A leader in sophisticated, ideas-based Jewish education for community leaders and change agents, SHI is committed to the significance of Jewish ideas, the power of applied scholarship, and the conviction that great teaching contributes to the growth and continual revitalization of the Jewish people. The Shalom Hartman Institute of North America partners with Jewish change agents-rabbis, lay leaders, scholars, educators, and professionals-to develop and implement unique models of pluralistic, in-depth, text-based teaching, scholarship, and programs that address the challenges facing contemporary North American Jewry.
