The Lubbock Area United Way is in the business of creating meaningful and tangible impact in our community. We help bring the community together to look at the most urgent needs and do whatever it takes to improve lives. We work to address the needs today and the issues of tomorrow. Research shows that quick-fix solutions addressing the symptoms of issues are not effective, we must address the root causes of problems in order to create lasting, positive change. We are about people empowering people. We care deeply about the individual lives that are changed. And, we care about improving the overall quality of life in this community. The Lubbock Area United Way stands for hope and optimism.
