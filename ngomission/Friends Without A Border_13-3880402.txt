FWAB was established in 1995 to construct and to operate Angkor Hospital for Children (AHC) in Siem Reap, Cambodia. Since it opened in 1999, AHC has provided free medical care to more than one million maimed, malnourished, and ill children. Working closely with Cambodia's Ministry of Health, AHC is recognized as an official teaching hospital and is the largest facility outside of the capital providing anti-retroviral treatment to HIV/AIDS patients. In 2011, FWAB expanded its impact by supporting The Lake Clinic, a boat-based health delivery organization serving the deprived floating villages on Cambodia's Tonle Sap, Southeast Asia's largest lake. In early 2013, Friends launched a new initiative and has furthered the reach of the mission to Laos. Expected to open in early 2015, Lao Friends Hospital for Children (LFHC) will replicate the successful model of Treatment + Education + Prevention that has been achieved at AHC.
