The Jackson Laboratory, founded in 1929, is an independent, nonprofit organization focusing on mammalian genetics research to advance human health. Our mission is to discover precise genomic solutions for disease and empower the global biomedical community in the shared quest to improve human health. We have 40 principal investigators leading research groups in six major areas: cancers, computational biology bioinformatics, developmental and reproductive biology, immunology, metabolic diseases, and neurobiology. Along with our research we provide scientific resources, techniques, software and data to scientists around the world. We breed and manage colonies of mice to supply other research institutions and laboratories.
