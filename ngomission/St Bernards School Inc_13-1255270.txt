Founded in 1904, St. Bernard's School offers able young boys of diverse backgrounds an exceptionally thorough, rigorous, and enjoyable introduction to learning and community life. We wish to inspire boys to value hard work and fair play, to develop confidence, consideration for others and a sense of citizenship, and to have fun while doing these things. The school meets the educational needs of approximately 380 students in classes from kindergarten through ninth grade. It is an accredited member of the New York State Association of Independent Schools and is a member of the National Association of Independent Schools and the New York Guild of Independent Schools.
