Established in 1915, The Minneapolis Foundation is one of the nation's oldest and largest community foundations. We manage nearly $700 million in assets, and administer more than 1,000 charitable funds created by individuals, families, businesses, and nonprofits. More than $30 million in grants are distributed from these funds each year, either personally recommended by or in accordance with the legacy wishes of our donors. Our purpose is to join with others to strengthen our community, in measurable and sustainable ways, for the benefit of all citizens, especially those who are disadvantaged.
