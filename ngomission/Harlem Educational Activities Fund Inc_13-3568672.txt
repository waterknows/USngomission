Founded in 1989, HEAF (Harlem Educational Activities Fund) is an education and youth leadership organization that helps motivated public school students in New York City who are educationally and economically disadvantaged develop the intellectual curiosity, academic ability, social values, and personal resiliency they need to ensure success in school, career, and life. HEAF identifies students in middle school and supports them until they are successfully graduated from four-year colleges through a variety of after-school, Saturday and summer educational and youth leadership programs. Since its inception, HEAF has served over 1,000 students through its remarkable school partnerships and community based programs.
