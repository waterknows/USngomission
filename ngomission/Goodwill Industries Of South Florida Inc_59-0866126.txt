Goodwill Industries of South Florida is dedicated to providing rehabilitation, on-the-job training, work experience, and placement services to help people with disabilities and special needs overcome barriers to employment and become employed in the community. Our vision is to be the leader in providing services to those with disabilities who want to work, but face barriers to employment, and to train and place them in jobs they can perform successfully and retain. Goodwill Industries of South Florida is a lot more than just a place to donate used household goods and clothing. It is a place where people with disabilities are rehabilitated and trained to be productive members of society.
