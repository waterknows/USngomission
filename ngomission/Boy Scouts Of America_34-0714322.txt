The Boy Scouts of America Greater Cleveland Council is devoted to preparing young people to make ethical and moral choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them values of the Scout oath and law. Nearly 22,000 young people in Cuyahoga and North Summit Counties are benefiting from the Boy Scout program. The Scouts help to mold future leaders of this country by combining educational activities and lifelong values with fun. The organization offers programs which help meet six essential needs of young people: mentoring, lifelong learning, faith traditions, serving others, healthy living and building character.
