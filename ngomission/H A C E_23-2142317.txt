Hispanic Association of Contractors & Enterprises (HACE) was founded in 1982 to save a crucial neighborhood mall in the heart of Philadelphia's Latino community. HACE's mission is to combat community deterioration through economic development initiatives that address commercial revitalization, employment opportunities, the creation of safe affordable housing, and the provision of support services to meet the needs of the community residents toward re-building the neighborhood's economic base. We focus on the possible and work to restore our primary neighborhood so that residents will benefit from sound investments while improving their quality of life. Since 1990, HACE has developed over 300 units of housing.
