Founded in 1920, Cleveland Museum of Natural History works to inspire, through science and education, a passion for nature, the protection of natural diversity, the fostering of health, and leadership to a sustainable future. The Museum's permanent exhibits include a three million-year-old human ancestor, known as Lucy, and one of the most complete mounted sauropods on display anywhere in the world. The Museum also features a planetarium; observatory; discovery center; live animal shows; and a wildlife center and woods garden highlighting native Ohio flora and fauna, including bobcats, river otters and birds of prey. Outside Museum walls, the Natural Areas Program protects more than 4,000 acres of rare habitat in Northern Ohio. The Museum announced two mergers in 2007: HealthSpace Cleveland in January 2007, and EcoCity Cleveland in June 2007.
