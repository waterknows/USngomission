The Works Museum seeks to inspire the next generation of innovators, engineers, and creative problem solvers. Our exhibits, programs, and design challenges engage kids in science, technology, and engineering and make learning memorable and fun. Dreams need doing, and exploring engineering gives a child the power to make stuff, break stuff, and make it better! We need the imagination and skill of engineers to solve the problems and address the challenges of our modern world. Engineering fuels collaboration, persistence, and problem solving; critical skills for every child from every walk of life. The Works Museum welcomes you to explore engineering and stretch your imagination.
