The Jacksonville Humane Society (JHS), established in 1885 as the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, serves as a resource to the community for all companion-related animal issues. JHS is dedicated to providing the community with valuable programs, services and resources that relate to animal care. Whether it's providing education about animal welfare issues, offering pet behavior training, running elementary school outreach programs, or even just passing on helpful pet-related information, our goal is to be a valuable resource for everyone with people-pet relationships.
