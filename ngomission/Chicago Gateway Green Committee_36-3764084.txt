Founded in 1986, Chicago Gateway Green continues to lead the charge in greening and beautifying our great city. The Tree Partnership, a large-scale tree planting initiative, will transform unused lands across Chicago into tree-filled green spaces. Working towards the goals of the Chicago Climate Action Plan, the Tree Partnership's plantings are planned to maximize environmental impact. The Expressway Partnership program stands out from typical â€˜adopt-a-highway' programs in other states. We work with landscape architects to create multi-year plans for each site so landscaping will fit in with the existing environment and eventually become sustainable. Chicago Gateway Green is celebrating twenty years of dedication to a beautiful Chicago.
