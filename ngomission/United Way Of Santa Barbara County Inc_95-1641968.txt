United Way of Santa Barbara County (UWSBC) has the unique and positive vision that in our community, everyone has a hopeful future. UWSBC has served the local community since its local founding in 1923 and, through our Power of Partnership, we improve the lives of children, families and seniors by connecting and empowering resources. UWSBC is not merely a fundraising agent, but rather acts as a unifying and multiplying force. UWSBC is focused on developing four key areas: successful children and teens, strong families, vital and independent seniors, and a better community.
