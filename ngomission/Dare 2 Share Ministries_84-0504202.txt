Founded in 1991, Dare 2 Share Ministries exists to mobilize teenagers to relationally and relentlessly reach their generation for Christ. Dare 2 Share is committed to affecting positive change in the increasingly troubled generation of teens. Dare 2 Share offers intense weekend training conferences nationally for Christian high school students. The conferences are held each school year in key metropolitan cities across the United States that motivate and train students to reach out to those around them by living and giving the life-changing message of the gospel in a contagious epidemic of love and truth. Dare 2 Share is convinced that the answer to this crisis in Christianity lies in an aggressive initiative to transform youth ministry from reactive and entertainment-based to Great Commission-driven and Scripture-based.
