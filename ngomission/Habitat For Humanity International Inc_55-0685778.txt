Almost Heaven Habitat for Humanity was organized in 1988 and incorporated on August 1, 1989 to eliminate substandard and poverty housing in Pendleton County, WV and to make safe, decent, affordable housing a matter of conscience and action. By having partner families and volunteers work together in equal partnership, Habitat builds new relationships and a sense of community as well as many new houses. Additionally, we operate a year-round housing repair program that strives to preserve the existing housing stock in the communities we serve through owner-occupied repairs. We have performed over 350 repairs of this nature. Almost Heaven Habitat for Humanity is the most productive Habitat affiliate in West Virginia.
