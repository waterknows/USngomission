Founded by Norman Scribner in 1965, the mission of Choral Arts is the pursuit of excellence in choral repertoire and performance, and the commitment to promote and share the art of choral music through education and public outreach. Committed to reach new and diverse audiences, especially the young, Choral Arts is dedicated to the live presentation of both new and classical choral masterworks in the Washington metro area while approaching new audiences nationally and internationally through tours, recordings, and electronic media. Education is a central component of Choral Arts contribution to the local and national community. The Education Programs at Choral Arts seek to nurture critical and creative thinking through music for learners at various stages of development.
