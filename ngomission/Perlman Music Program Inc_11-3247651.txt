Founded in 1993, the Perlman Music Program (PMP) welcomes young musicians of rare and special talent into a richly supportive musical community. Through intensive summer programs, year-round mentoring, and on occasion, an international study or performance tour, the program offers unparalleled musical training for students, ages 12 to 30, who play the violin, viola, cello, bass and piano. With a faculty led by Itzhak Perlman and comprising some of the most gifted musical talents of our time, the Program offers an artistic and personal experience that changes students' lives forever. PMP seeks to ensure that the very best musicians can take advantage of this opportunity, regardless of their economic background or financial means.
