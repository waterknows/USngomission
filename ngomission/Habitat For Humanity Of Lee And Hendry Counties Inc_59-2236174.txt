Seeking to put God's love into action, Habitat for Humanity brings people together to build homes, communities and hope. Habitat for Humanity of Lee and Hendry Counties is one of the largest Habitat affiliates in the country, and has helped more than 1,280 families in Lee and Hendry counties become homeowners. Habitat homes are built through the use of volunteer labor and donations of money and materials. The homes are then sold to the homeowners with an interest-free mortgage and monthly payments set at less than 30% of the homeowner's income, making homeownership an affordable reality. Habitat homeowners must qualify financially for the program; save $1,200 toward their closing costs; attend classes focusing on homeownership, budgeting and home maintenance; and complete 250 hours of "sweat equity" by volunteering at Habitat.
