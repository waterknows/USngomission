God's Pit Crew is ready, trained and prepared to respond to the seemingly increased threats of natural disasters and major crises. God's Pit Crew has delivered and helped distribute tens of millions of pounds of relief supplies (water, hygiene items, cleaning supplies, food, diapers, etc) into disaster areas. Our volunteers have cut thousands of trees off of people's homes, gutted houses, patched roofs, totally rebuilt homes and churches and they have prayed with people and given them hope in their time of need.
