The Hands On Children's Museum stimulates curiosity, creativity and learning through fun, interactive exhibits and programs for children, families and school groups. At Hands On, we believe that all children deserve respect and the opportunity to learn. Our extensive Free & Reduced Admissions Programs serve about 25,000 visitors a year with free or reduced programs, and serve another 50,000 visitors through free community outreach.
