Child Foundation helps children in need, who have been identified as high achievers, to remain in school. Since 1994, Child Foundation has provided basic necessities to children living in poverty or hardship. By providing access to education, Child Foundation hopes to eliminate children prematurely leaving school, and, in certain countries, early matrimony. We believe that education can move a child beyond the stigma of poverty, and give that child the tools to reach his or her true potential.
