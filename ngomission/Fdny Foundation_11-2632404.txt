The FDNY Foundation supports the critical life saving work of the Fire Department of New York (FDNY). As the official fundraising vehicle for the FDNY for more than two decades, the Foundation works collaboratively with the Fire Department to support its most crucial priorities; to reduce firefighter and civilian deaths and injury. The Foundation continues to support FDNY initiatives for education, fire prevention, training and equipment needs that are not funded through city, state or federal budgets. Each year the FDNY Foundation, in conjunction with the FDNY, supports various projects and programs including: FDNY Fire Zone, a state of the art fire safety learning center; Fire Zone on the Road, a fire safety outreach campaign; fire safety public awareness campaigns; and The Family Assistance Program, which provides assistance to the families of fallen firefighters.
