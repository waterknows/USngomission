IDRF's mission is to empower marginalized people with skills, services and infrastructure grounded in sustainable development. We provide support for programs that improve education, healthcare, women's empowerment, governance, and eco-friendly livelihoods in poor communities in India and Nepal. We especially focus on women and children living in rural India. Our programs are implemented by carefully-vetted and experienced local NGOs.
