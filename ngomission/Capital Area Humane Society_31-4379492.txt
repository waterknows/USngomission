The Capital Area Humane Society, founded in 1883, is dedicated to the elimination of cruelty, abuse, neglect, and abandonment of animals. The Society achieves its goals through programs and services for people and pets in the community based on humane principles and respect for non-human animals. Our vision is for all animals to live free of suffering and all companion animals to be valued members of loving and caring families.
