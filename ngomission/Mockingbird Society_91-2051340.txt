Founded in 2000, The Mockingbird Society is dedicated to building a world-class foster care system that ensures the care, support, and resources necessary for children, youth, and families to thrive. Their mission is to advocate for systems reform based on the personal experiences of children, youth, and families impacted by the foster care system. The belief is that all children need the same things - love, care, support and resource - drives everything The Mockingbird Society does.
