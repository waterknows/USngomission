The Philanthropy Roundtable traces its origins to the 1970s, when it began as a small, informal network of grantmakers committed to fostering a greater respect for donor intent and encouraging private, voluntary solutions to society's most pressing challenges. Today, The Philanthropy Roundtable is America's leading network of charitable donors working to strengthen our free society, uphold donor intent, and protect the freedom to give. Our members include individual philanthropists, families, and private foundations.
