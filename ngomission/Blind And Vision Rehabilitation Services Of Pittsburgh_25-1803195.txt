For more than 100 years, Blind and Vision Rehabilitation Services of Pittsburgh has provided top-rated programs and services in Allegheny County and communities throughout Pennsylvania and neighboring states to people of all ages who are blind and visually impaired. Our mission is to change the lives of persons we serve by fostering independence and individual choice. We believe that every person with vision loss and hearing loss can be taught to use their other senses and the vision that remains to live independently and with confidence. We believe that every blind person can learn adaptive techniques and develop new skills so they may live independently.
