The Florentine Opera Company (FOC) is one of Wisconsin's oldest and most enduring professional performing arts organizations. Celebrating its 75th Anniversary Season in 2008-2009, it is also the sixth oldest opera company in the United States. All programs are driven by the mission to present Grand Opera productions reflecting the highest musical and theatrical standards and designed to fulfill the Company's vision to expand the experiences of patrons with memorable, outstanding and exciting performances. The education department works to make opera more inviting and accessible to communities in Milwaukee and throughout the state of Wisconsin by: educating students and the community about opera and career opportunities within opera; providing opera introduction and continuing education events for adults; and providing opportunities for young artists.
