Martha's Kitchen works to feed the hungry with dignity, no questions asked, no judgment made. It sends out over 260,000 hot and cold meals annually to over 30 other non-profit organizations in Santa Clara county as far south as Morgan Hill and Gilroy, as well as Merced, Santa Cruz and Monterey counties. Martha's Kitchen has created a network of cooperating community-based organizations who collaborate to help each other deliver the services for which they have the expertise. This arrangement allows participating agencies to focus on their core competencies at the most efficient level by avoiding duplication of services.
