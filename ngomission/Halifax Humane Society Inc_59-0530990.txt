Founded in 1937, Halifax Humane Society serves the Greater Daytona Beach area in Volusia County, Florida. We are an open-door animal shelter, receiving over 25,000 animals annually through city contracts and owner surrenders. Kennel and cage capacity can comfortably house approximately 350 animals per day and is usually full. Equipped with a spay/neuter clinic, we perform early-age spay/neuter surgeries to ensure that all adopted animals are altered before entering a new home. Low cost spay/neuter certificates are also made available to the public. We provide humane education to any and all schools, businesses, civic groups, etc. through speaking engagements, tours and material.
