The Columbus Academy has built a tradition of excellence upon a strong foundation forged by its founders in 1911. One of the premier Pre-K through grade 12 co-educational country day schools in the United States, Columbus Academy continues to provide area students with an exceptional academic education and a wide array of extra-curricular opportunities. Our motto, "In Quest of the Best" emphasizes developing the entire individual -- intellectually, socially, ethically, artistically and physically. 100% of Columbus Academy graduates attend major colleges and universities, and our students consistently place highly in state and national artistic, musical and choral competitions.
