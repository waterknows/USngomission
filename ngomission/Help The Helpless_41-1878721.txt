Help the Helpless is dedicated to serving the poorest of the poor children in Southern India. Help the Helpless supports St. Mary's School and Orphanage for handicapped, deaf, orphaned, abandoned and poor children living in severe poverty. Help the Helpless was started in 1969 by Fr. Antony, a Catholic Priest who has devoted his life to serving the poor. Since St. Mary's opened its doors in 1969, they have provided physical, emotional, spiritual, educational and financial help for hundreds of handicapped and poor children, providing these young people with the tools they need to be self-sufficient. St. Mary's School and Orphanage welcomes all visitors and invites you to visit and stay with us in India, free of charge.
