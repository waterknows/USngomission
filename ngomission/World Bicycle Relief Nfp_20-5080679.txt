World Bicycle Relief mobilizes people through the power of bicycles. Our vision is a world where distance is no longer a barrier to education, healthcare and economic opportunity. Compared to walking, bicycles represent an enormous leap in productivity and access to healthcare, education and economic development opportunities. The simple, sustainable nature of bicycles empowers individuals, families and communities. With over 238,000 bicycles in the field and more than 1,000 field mechanics trained, World Bicycle Relief is changing lives across Africa. World Bicycle Relief and its partners have assembly facilities in Angola, Kenya, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe and has supplied bicycles through programs in Angola, Colombia, Indonesia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Peru, the Philippines, Rwanda, South Africa, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
