Vista Del Mar's mission is to provide comprehensive, family-centered social, educational and behavioral health services that encourage children, adolescents and their families to lead self reliant, stable and productive lives. Founded in 1908 Vista Del Mar placed orphaned children in an innovative cottage setting with house parents rather than the institutional environment typical of the time, Vista became known as one of the finest residential programs in the country. With the addition of its divisions: Reiss Davis Child Study Center, Julia Ann Singer Center, HomeSAFE and Family Service of Santa Monica, Vista is truly one of the most comprehensive care facilities for children experiencing mental health problems, behavioral problems, emotional problems, or social problems.
