Mystic Seaport was originally established as the Marine Historical Association in 1929 to create a dynamic, educational institution to preserve America's maritime culture and turn the achievements of a past era into an inspirational force for the future. Mystic Seaport has amassed the world's largest collections of maritime photography (over one million images) and boats (nearly 500), and has collected two million other maritime artifacts. Widely recognized as the nation's leading maritime museum, today Mystic Seaport is making the history of America's relationship with the sea even more accessible to all-new audiences. More than 300,000 people visit Mystic Seaport annually.
