Center for Arizona Policy (CAP) promotes and defends the foundational values of life, marriage and family, and religious liberty. Our heart is to create an Arizona where: the sanctity of human life is protected from its very beginning to its natural end; marriages and families are strengthened and supported by public policy, not attacked or weakened; and religious liberty is affirmed and protected, free from government interference.
