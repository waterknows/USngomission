Make-A-Wish Central and Western North Carolina grants the wishes of children living with life-threatening medical conditions to enrich the human experience with hope, strength and joy. The Central and Western North Carolina Chapter was founded in 1985 by Dr. Jerry Clark in Greensboro, NC, in honor of his wife Charlotte. The chapter covers 51 counties from Alamance county west. We have never turned down the wish of an eligible child. The chapter currently grants more than 220 wishes a year.
