The Hyde Collection's mission is to develop and highlight a collection of international importance, create exhibitions of regional and national significance, and provide invigorating educational programs to its core local audiences and communities. The Hyde's collection is a truly remarkable group of works and is a testament to the vision of our founder, Charlotte Pruyn Hyde, and her husband, Louis Fiske Hyde. Works from the collection the Rembrandt, the Rubens, the Picasso, the Renoirs, and the Hassam, for instance are constantly in demand by museums around the world as they plan their exhibitions. A large part of this collection is installed in the elegant atmosphere of historic Hyde House, an American Renaissance mansion built in 1912. Our educational programming impacts the lives of thousands of local children as well as families, adults, and seniors.
