The Jewish Federation of Greater Des Moines is at the heart of the Greater Des Moines community, which includes Ames, Marshalltown, and other cities and towns in Central Iowa. The diverse efforts of individual organizations are coordinated, central fundraising is executed, and community planning and community relations activities are administered through the Federation. In addition to four major commissions, the Federation seeks to involve the community through the All-in-One campaign, community travel missions, planning and allocations, leadership development and publication of The Jewish Press. In Israel, Federation funds help provide for health, social, and educational services for children, university and vocational students, families, the aged, and the handicapped.
