Since 1978, the Denver Film Society has worked to promote the medium of cinema as both an art form and a civic forum, developing a program that includes year-round screenings, community outreach projects and renowned special events. It is dedicated to engaging both its members and the general public in a lifelong, life-altering relationship with and understanding of film and film culture. The twin pillars it has built on the foundation of this vision are the award-winning Starz Denver Film Festival, now in its third decade, and the Sie FilmCenter.
