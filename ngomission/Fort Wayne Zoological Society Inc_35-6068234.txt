The Fort Wayne Zoological Society was established in 1966 to assist in the development and growth of the Fort Wayne Children's Zoo (FWCZ). The Zoological Society is active in all areas of promotion, fundraising and programming of the zoo, which is operated by the Fort Wayne Board of Park Commissioners. The FWCZ works to help people gain a greater appreciation of wildlife, encourage family fun in a natural setting, and help save the world's wild animals and wild places. FWCZ is internationally recognized for its innovative displays, award-winning animal exhibits and well-manicured grounds.
