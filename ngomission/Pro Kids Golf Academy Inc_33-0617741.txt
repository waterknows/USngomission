Pro Kids Golf Academy's mission is to challenge underserved youth to excel in life by promoting character development, life-skills, and values through education and the game of golf. We aim to be a leader in providing opportunity and hope through positive life-changing experiences to underserved youth in San Diego County. Pro Kids was founded by former AFL player Ernest H. Wright, Sr. and incorporated in 1994. That same year, we partnered with the City of San Diego and the San Diego Unified School District to use Colina Park Golf Course as an outdoor classroom to teach life-skills and golf to inner-city kids. In 1997, we were used as a model for The First Tee, an international organization and became The First Tee of San Diego. We initiated a scholarship program in 1999 awarding $1 million to 80 students over the past ten years.
