The South Florida Science Museum's mission is to excite curiosity and further understanding and appreciation of science and technology. Dozens of fun, hands-on interactive exhibits based on scientific principles challenge visitors' ideas about science and technology. Interactive exhibits show you how to create clouds, generate electricity with a bike, marvel at optical illusions, and build and control your own robot. Natural history exhibits include Suzie, a 22,000 year-old mastodon found in Palm Beach County, as well as authentic and reproduction skeletons of whales, sharks and dinosaurs. Sea life from warm waters around the world populate the museum's aquariums, while an acre of naturally landscaped outdoor trails features over a dozen original interactive exhibits. Exciting laser shows and star shows thrill young and old alike in the Dekelboum Planetarium.
