Ghetto Film School educates, develops, and celebrates the next generation of great American storytellers. The programs teach the arts of cinematic storytelling to the young people in the Bronx and beyond. The organization is supported by a wide network of filmmakers, media professionals, corporate and government partners. Ghetto Film School operates three inter-related programs; each year we educate 650 young storytellers with our South Bronx programming, and over 100,000 nationwide and beyond through strategic collaborations and an online MasterClass series.
