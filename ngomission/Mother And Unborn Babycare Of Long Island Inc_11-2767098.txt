Our mission at The Life Center of Long Island is to empower pregnant and parenting women by providing them with the resources and emotional support needed to take care of themselves and their children and enable them to make healthy decisions for their future. Skilled consultants are available to provide information, guidance, hope, and encouragement to women and men struggling with an unplanned pregnancy. We provide healing opportunities for any woman or man who has struggled with the profound emotional pain that often accompanies the abortion experience.
