Founded in 1996, the YMCA of Martha's Vineyard is dedicated to improving the quality of life for children, individuals, families and the Island community by helping our members realize their fullest potential through the development of body, mind, and spirit. Through our programs, we aim to provide year-round services for youth, adults and families; to prevent and intervene with at-risk youth and teens; to bring different sectors of Island life together through the offering of a multitude of services and intergenerational opportunities; and to develop health and prevention programs, leadership development, job skills training, learning opportunities, and leisure activities for these identified groups.
