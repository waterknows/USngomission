Affirmations Lesbian and Gay Community Center was founded on the philosophy that gay is good, you are not alone. This philosophy has expanded to include bisexual and transgender individuals in addition to lesbians and gay men. Affirmations strives to create an atmosphere of safety and acceptance for all people. Our focus is on helping lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals find and develop community where we value and respect ourselves and others. Affirmations philosophy promotes the principle of empowerment and educates volunteers to utilize strength-based and holistic approaches. Through training in the basic operations of the center, listening, communication, empathy, problem solving, facilitation, and other appropriate skills, interested and dedicated individuals can successfully volunteer at Affirmations.
