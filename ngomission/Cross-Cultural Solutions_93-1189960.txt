Cross-Cultural Solutions was founded in 1995 and is a recognized leader in the field of international volunteering. Each year, over 4,000 people volunteer abroad with CCS in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe in the areas of care giving, teaching, healthcare, and community development. Our mission is to operate volunteer programs around the world in partnership with sustainable community initiatives, bringing people together to work side-by-side while sharing perspectives and fostering cultural understanding. Our vision is of a world where people value cultures different from their own, are aware of global issues, and are empowered to effect positive change.
