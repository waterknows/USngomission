Established in 1989, New Mission Systems International (NMSI) is an agency that fosters the emergence of Jesus-following communities globally. Our vision is to support and place people in fields of service to minister God's love so that people of all nations may be saved. NMSI works with local churches or believers and will only accept a call to places where we can add value or freshness to their ministry that is not otherwise available to them. In the past nineteen years, NMSI has ministered in 28 countries on six continents. We currently have full time missionaries residing in 27 countries. These missionaries, while predominantly Americans, are from 18 nationalities.
