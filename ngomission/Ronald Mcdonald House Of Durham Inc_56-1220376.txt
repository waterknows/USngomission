Since 1980, the Ronald McDonald House of Durham has allowed families to focus on the health and well-being of their critically ill children by keeping families together who are in need of a community of hope, comfort, and empathy. Ronald McDonald House of Durham offers families the comforts of home - inviting bedrooms, bright community spaces, daily home-cooked meals and a fully stocked kitchen - as well as a network of support through interactions with other families, staff and volunteers. The families who rely on the Ronald McDonald House of Durham know they can count on us to provide a home away from home every day at our House and at our Family Room.
