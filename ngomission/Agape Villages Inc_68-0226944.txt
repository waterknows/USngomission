Agape Villages (then known as Sierra Children's Home) began its ministry to children in 1958. Beginning as a small children's home located in Solano County that served dependent abused and neglected children, Agape's initial program evolved into a network of regional group homes. Established as a ministry of caring, Christian people, the original program became an effective, multi-service, residential treatment facility committed to serving some of California's most troubled young people. Today, children without safe homes are depending on Agape Villages to help them reshape their futures. Agape Villages Foster Family Agency is recruiting, training, certifying and then supervising and supporting families who chose to become foster parents to homeless children.
