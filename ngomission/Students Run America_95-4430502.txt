The mission of Students Run LA (SRLA) is to challenge at-risk secondary students to experience the benefits of goal-setting, character development, adult mentoring and improved health by providing them with a truly life-changing experience: The training for and completion of the LA Marathon. SRLA is a physical fitness and mentoring program. While running is the core activity of the program, SRLA students learn that discipline and hard work lead to success at both the marathon and in life. These lessons translate directly into their education: SRLA students enjoy school, stay in school and graduate at a higher rate than do their peers. During 2011-12, more than 3,000 students participated in SRLA.
