FRAXA Research Foundation was founded in 1994 by three parents of children with Fragile X syndrome, Katie Clapp, Michael Tranfaglia, MD, and Kathy May, to support scientific research aimed at finding a treatment and a cure for Fragile X syndrome. Fragile X research is drastically underfunded, considering its high prevalence, prospects for a cure, and the promise that this research holds for advancing understanding of other disorders like autism, Alzheimer's disease, and X-linked mental retardation. FRAXA funds grants and fellowships at universities all over the world. We have funded more than $17 million dollars in top-notch science. Fragile X is the most common inherited cause of intellectual impairment and the most common known genetic cause of autism.
