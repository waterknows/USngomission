When dealing with breast cancer, most women feel overwhelmed by vast amounts of information, and are terrified by the burden of having to make critical decisions quickly. In 1999, Dr. Marisa Weiss, a nationally renowned breast oncologist, founded Breastcancer.org to address these growing needs. Breastcancer.org is dedicated to providing the most reliable, complete, and up-to-date information about breast cancer. Our mission is to help women and their loved ones make sense of the complex medical and personal information about breast cancer, so they can make the best decisions for their lives.
