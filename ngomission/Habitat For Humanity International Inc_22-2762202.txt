Habitat for Humanity Newark works in partnership with low-income families to build decent homes they can afford to buy. Founded in 1986, Habitat Newark initially focused its efforts on Newark's most economically distressed neighborhoods in the Central and West Wards and has since expanded its efforts within Essex County. Partner families invest a minimum of 400 hours in the construction of their own home as well as those of their neighbor partner families. They make payments on an income-based zero-interest mortgage. Thanks to the support of dedicated volunteers and donors, Habitat Newark has been able to build homes for nearly 80 families during its history and to help to break the cycle of poverty and hopelessness.
