Founded in 1888 by Isaiah Vansant Williamson, The Williamson Free School of Mechanical Trades prepares deserving young men to be useful and respected members of society. To accomplish the mission, Williamson gratuitously provides students with academic, trade, technical, moral and religious education, and a living environment based on the Judeo-Christian perspective that fosters the values of faith, integrity, diligence, excellence, and service. Areas of study include construction technology (carpentry or masonry emphasis); horticulture, landscaping and turf management; machine tool technology; paint and coatings technology; and power plant technology. All students attend on full scholarships that cover tuition, room, board and textbooks.
