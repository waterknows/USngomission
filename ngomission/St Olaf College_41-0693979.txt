Founded in 1874 by Norwegian Lutheran immigrants, St. Olaf is a nationally ranked liberal arts college of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. A liberal arts education at St. Olaf offers programs that provide students with the skills to succeed in valuable careers. But our main purpose - rooted in the depth of a major course of study and the breadth of a general education - is to help students become effective citizens in an increasingly complicated world. Our 3,000 students are drawn to St. Olaf from 50 states and 30 other countries. The student-faculty ratio of 12.8:1 encourages individual learning and teaching, while the residential nature of the 300-acre campus helps students become part of an enduring community that takes pride in its traditions and innovations.
