Harmony Project is an award-winning research-based nonprofit organization that targets at-risk youth in underserved areas of Los Angeles. We promote positive youth development through year-round music lessons and ensemble participation. Our mission is to: promote the healthy growth and development of children through the study, practice and performance of music; to build healthier communities by investing in the positive development of children through music; to develop children as musical ambassadors of peace, hope and understanding amongst people of diverse cultures, backgrounds and beliefs. We accomplish this by bringing quality music instruction and ensemble playing to children who otherwise would not have access to it; complementing music education with supporting resources and opportunities; and, fostering a community of families that actively support their children's growth and development.
