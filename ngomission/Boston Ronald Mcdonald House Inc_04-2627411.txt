The Boston Ronald McDonald House opened its doors in Brookline in 1979, establishing itself as the eighth House in the country. The Boston Ronald McDonald House is a home-away-from-home for families of children ages birth through 21 being treated for cancer at Children's Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute's Jimmy Fund Clinic and other area hospitals. Families live with us while their children are inpatients, undergoing surgery, chemotherapy and bone marrow transplants. They also stay while the children receive outpatient treatment such as radiation therapy and many types of chemotherapy.
