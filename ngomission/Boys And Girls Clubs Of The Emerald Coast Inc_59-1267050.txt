The Boys & Girls Club of the Emerald Coast works to inspire and empower all young people and their families, in partnership with our community, to achieve their full potential to be great. For the past forty years the Boys & Girls Clubs of the Emerald Coast have passed on a tradition of excellence to the next generation by empowering them to become strong adults, responsible citizens, and community leaders. We are empowering kids to achieve academic success, build good character and lead healthy lifestyles. We also encourage our community to be a part, because we believe that when you empower a kid you change the world.
