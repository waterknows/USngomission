Founded in 1981, Foster Care to Success (formerly Orphan Foundation of America) serves thousands of foster teens across the United States. Whether we're providing them with college scholarships, connecting them with mentors and internships, sending them care packages, or testifying before Congress, Foster Care to Success is a passionate champion of foster youth. Our mission is to provide opportunities for America's foster youth to pursue their college and post-secondary education; highlight the potential of America's foster youth; create pathways for citizens, businesses, and civic organizations to assist older foster youth; raise public awareness of the number and plight of older teens leaving the system; and draw attention to the bureaucratic maze of foster care.
