Founded in 1985, Visually Impaired Preschool Services (VIPS) empowers families by providing educational excellence to young children with visual impairments in order to build a strong foundation for reaching their highest potential. VIPS serves blind or visually impaired infants, toddlers, and preschoolers. As much as 90% of brain development occurs prior to age 6 and of that, approximately 80% is through visual pathways. Therefore, early intervention is critical for a child with blindness and visual impairments to help them meet appropriate development milestones such as eating, moving, socializing and communicating. VIPS staff includes certified teachers who specialize in early childhood education, visual impairment, and special education. VIPS provides services wherever the child may be throughout the entire Commonwealth of Kentucky and State of Indiana. We start with providing services in the home and stay involved until age 5 when the child enters Kindergarten.
