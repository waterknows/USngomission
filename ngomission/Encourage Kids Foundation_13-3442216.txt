enCourage Kids Foundation encourages all kids facing health challenges to be carefree kids by creating environments and experiences that help them through each step of their medical journey. The programs that have made us so successful over the past 30 years are the ones that were developed – and grown – locally in the tri-state area. As enCourage Kids Foundation, we will be able to expand upon these programs and make a deeper impact on a local level. Effective October 30, 2015 Starlight Children's Foundation NY*NJ*CT will operate under the new name of enCourage Kids Foundation, as an independent not-for-profit corporation, and is no longer affiliated with Starlight Children's Foundation. enCourage Kids Foundation will continue its mission of serving kids and their families.
