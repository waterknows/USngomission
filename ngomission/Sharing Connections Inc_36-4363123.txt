Sharing Connections (SC) was founded in 2000 with the mission to share good things with good people. SC brings together community members by enabling families and businesses to share their gently used furniture and household items with families needing assistance. SC staff works closely with referring partner organizations. Organizations such as domestic violence shelters, housing organizations, food pantries, schools, veteran, and teen parent organizations refer clients to SC after they have determined the need for beds, cribs, furniture and other household items.
