The Northeast Georgia Council was chartered by the Boy Scouts of America in 1935 to provide Scouting programs in twenty-seven counties. These counties included all of the currently served counties along with Newton County (now part of the Atlanta Area Council). Beginning in 1916 there was a council based in Athens and 1928, one in Gainesville. These councils merged to form the Northeast Georgia Council. After years of phenomenal growth in the northeast Georgia area, our council now serves more than 25,000 youth in Cub Scouting, Boy Scouting, Varsity Scouting, Venturing, Exploring, and in-school Learning for Life. There are more than 600 scouting units throughout the council.
