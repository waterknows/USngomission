The Billings Food Bank was started in 1982 with four area churches designating the first Sunday of every month as Food Bank Sunday. The program has since grown with ownership of a 27,000 square foot warehouse. Currently, we are providing over $5 million in food an other essentials to over 40 agencies within Montana and offering support to other states and countries when the need arises and resources are available. We also provide food and nutrition classes in our Montana Harvest Kitchen, and developed Montana's first certified commercial kitchen and food processing center to be used by entrepreneurs wanting to develop their own food related business.
