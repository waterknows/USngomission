South Coast Repertory (SCR) was founded in 1964 in the belief that theatre is an art form with a unique power to illuminate the human experience. We commit ourselves to exploring the most urgent human and social issues of our time, and to merging literature, design and performance in ways that test the bounds of theatre's artistic possibilities. We undertake to advance the art of theatre in the service of our community, and aim to extend that service through educational, intercultural, and outreach programs that harmonize with our artistic mission. Through its school and community programs, SCR offers a comprehensive array of programs to make live theatre available for everyone in our community.
