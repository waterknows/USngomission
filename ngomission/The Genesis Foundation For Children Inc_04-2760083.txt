Founded in 1982, the mission of the Genesis Foundation for Children (TGFC) is to raise money to fund innovative clinical, educational and therapeutic programs for children with complex genetic disorders. Our work ensures that these children and their families receive the care and support they need. The Genesis Foundation for Children primarily supports The Feingold Center for Children at Boston Children's Hospital (FCC), The Pregnancy Exposure InfoLine (PEIL) and Therapy & the Performing Arts (TPA). TGFC also provides support to others that share our desire to provide coordinated care to children with special needs.
