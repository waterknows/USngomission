Founded in 1982, Community & Senior Services of Midland (CSS) works to improve the quality of life of Midlanders by providing an array of services to help them maintain health, dignity, and independence as they grow older. CSS offers a variety of programs designed to meet recognized needs in Midland, especially in the older population. Many CSS services target the elderly and disabled, with an emphasis placed on serving individuals who are low-income, frail, and homebound.
