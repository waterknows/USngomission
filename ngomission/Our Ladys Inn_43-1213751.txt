Our Lady's Inn (OLI) is an emergency shelter for pregnant women in crisis, helping them to choose life for their unborn child. Founded on January 22, 1982, OLI provides pregnant women and their children shelter and hope for a new life through humble acts of love. A woman may come to Our Lady's Inn at any time during her pregnancy and stay until after the birth of the baby. Upon entering the program, she must commit to an individualized self-sufficiency plan which she and a caring staff member develop together. Since 1982, OLI has provided emergency maternity home shelter to over 4,000 homeless, pregnant women and their children.
