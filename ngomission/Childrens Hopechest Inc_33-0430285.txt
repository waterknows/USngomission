Children's HopeChest is a global leader and innovator in orphan care ministry. Since 1994, our programs have helped bring children out of the isolation of orphan hood and into the joy and warmth of family programs. Growing out of a Bible distribution to Russian orphanages, Children's HopeChest now reaches thousands of orphans through our orphanage sponsorship program and other follow-up outreaches. Each of our programs attempts to restore wholeness to the brokenness that is orphan hood. We believe orphans have the greatest chances for success when they are surrounded by loving role models who remind them of their great worth and value in the eyes of God.
