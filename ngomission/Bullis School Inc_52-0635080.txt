Bullis School is an independent, co-educational college preparatory day school offering girls and boys in grades 3-12 an educational program of excellence in a community that values integrity, respect, responsibility, diversity and service. A caring and supportive faculty fosters a positive attitude about learning and challenges our students to achieve their highest potential in academics, the arts and athletics. The school has a proud heritage. Founded in 1930 by Cmdr. William F. Bullis in downtown Washington, D.C., Bullis was originally established as a preparatory school for the United States Naval Academy, and over time has evolved into the co-educational college preparatory school that it is today.
