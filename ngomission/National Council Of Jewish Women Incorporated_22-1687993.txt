The National Council of Jewish Women, Essex County Section is a grassroots organization of volunteers and advocates who turn progressive ideals into action. Inspired by Jewish values, NCJW strives for social justice by improving the quality of life for women, children, and families and by safeguarding individual rights and freedoms. Founded in 1912, the Essex Section comprises a collaborative team including a 15-person executive committee, a 60-person section board, 12 staff members, dozens of committee chairs, and hundreds of active volunteers. Our offices are located in Livingston, New Jersey. Our work falls under three broad umbrellas: Community Services for women and children from all over Essex County, New Jersey, as well as the surrounding counties of Union and Morris, and other parts of the state; Events and Programs for our members and for the community at large, and Advocacy, locally and nationally, on behalf of issues that affect women, children, and families.
