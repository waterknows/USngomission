Ronald McDonald House® Charities of Memphis is a "home-away-from-home" for families who are in Memphis while their child is receiving treatment for cancer or another catastrophic illness at St Jude Children's Research Hospital. All families stay completely free of charge. Families are stronger when they are together, and their presence helps a sick child heal faster and cope better. While Ronald McDonald House Charities® of Memphis cannot make medicine taste better or take away painful treatments, we can help lessen the burden and ensure families have the stability and resources to keep their child healthy and happy.
