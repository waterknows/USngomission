The Luis Palau Association's mission is to proclaim the gospel, mobilize the church and equip the next generation. In dependence upon God, we want to: win as many people as possible to Jesus Christ throughout the world, proclaim His Good News by all available means to the millions of people who have yet to respond to the Gospel; emphasize with the Church the principles of victorious Christian living (Galatians 2:20), so as to stimulate, revive, train, and mobilize the Church to continuous, effective evangelism, follow-up, and church growth; and hold high the banner of biblical evangelism, influencing Christianity worldwide and raising up a new generation of godly leaders, so that the Church's commitment to evangelism will never die.
