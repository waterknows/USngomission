The Legal Aid Society of the District of Columbia was formed in 1932 to provide civil legal aid to individuals, families and communities in the District who could not otherwise afford to hire a lawyer. Over the last 80 years, Legal Aid has helped tens of thousands of District residents obtain meaningful access to justice. Legal Aid is the law firm for clients who cannot afford a lawyer. Our staff and volunteers work each day in making the justice system work. Each year, with the support of the legal community, we extend our reach further and work harder to make justice meaningful for everyone.
