Through its exhibitions, education, and outreach programs, the Santa Monica Museum of Art fosters diversity, innovation, and discovery in contemporary art—local, national, and international. The only kunsthalle, non-collecting museum, in Southern California, SMMoA presents exhibitions and programs that reveal the vibrant, untold stories and pivotal moments in the history of contemporary art and culture. To this end, SMMoA devotes its exhibition spaces—the Main Gallery and two project rooms—to presenting and advancing the work of contemporary local, national, and international artists whose work merits sustained inquiry and recognition.
