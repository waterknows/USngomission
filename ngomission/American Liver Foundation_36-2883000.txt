Founded in 1976, the American Liver Foundation (ALF) makes a measurable difference in the fight against liver disease by providing financial support for medical research, education for medical professionals, and advocacy and information for patients and their families, and by creating public awareness campaigns about liver wellness and disease prevention. Since inception the Research Awards Program has provided more than $22 million for research. We implement a wide range of educational and preventative efforts. In addition, ALF takes a leadership role in advocating on behalf of the millions of Americans living with liver disease and their families.
