The Boys & Girls Clubs of Snohomish County is a non-profit organization providing young people ages 5-18 with a safe and positive place to spend their time before and after school and in the summer. We have 19 Clubs and 15 extension sites that provide programs that help nearly 17,000 youth achieve academic success, live healthy and active lifestyles, and develop good character and leadership skills. Clubs are strategically located in neighborhoods and are accessible to all kids. Since 1946, the Boys & Girls Clubs of Snohomish County has been helping kids from tough neighborhoods stay out of trouble, stay in school and succeed in life.
