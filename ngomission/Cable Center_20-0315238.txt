The Cable Center, which opened its doors in 2001, provides education and information to the educational community, the cable industry, and the public, while celebrating cable's contributions to society. Created to educate, to remember, and to influence, the Cable Center is both a destination and launching pad. It's part repository, part incubator. It's a busy, active environment where the cable industry, the education community, and the general public go to learn, to advance their careers, and to enhance their understanding of cable telecommunications. Headquartered in Denver, The Center chronicles the story of where cable has been, and provides the tools and knowledge to support where it's going.
