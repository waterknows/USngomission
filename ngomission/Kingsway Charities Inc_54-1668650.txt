Founded in 1993, Kingsway Charities is a faith-based, Christian organization improving the lives of the sick and suffering worldwide by providing life-sustaining resources so they will know Gods love and compassion. They provide much needed medicine and medical supplies to medical missionaries working in third world and developing countries where poverty and suffering are rampant. Their primary focus is International Medical Mission, a ministry that warehouses medications and medical supplies donated from pharmaceutical companies. These donations are then shipped to qualified medical mission teams serving the poor.
