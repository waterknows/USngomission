Founded in 1869, the Maryland SPCA is dedicated to helping animals and people. Our mission is to improve the lives of pets and people in the community by fostering healthy animal-human relationships. We operate primarily in the Greater Baltimore Metropolitan area. Our adoption center adopts out over 3,000 needy and unwanted pets each year. We focus on being progressive in the way we run our adoption center. We also work to prevent pet abandonment by being a resource for the community. We offer behavior counseling and training courses to help keep pets in homes. Spay/neuter is also critical to our mission and we provide these services to: our adopted animals, to animals from area rescue groups and shelters, and, in partnership with other groups, to feral cat colonies to reduce overpopulation and suffering.
