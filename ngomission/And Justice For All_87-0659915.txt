And Justice for All believes access to justice is a fundamental right in our society. And Justice for all is committed to providing legal services, free of charge, for Utah's most vulnerable citizens - people living in poverty, individuals with disabilities, veterans, seniors, minorities and victims of domestic violence. We work with law firms, attorneys, judges, legal staff and other community partners to help ensure that Utahns across the state have access to the legal system, regardless of income level, disability, age or minority status.
