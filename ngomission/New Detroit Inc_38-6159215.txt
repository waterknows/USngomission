New Detroit's mission is "to work as the coalition of Detroit area leadership addressing the issue of race relations by positively impacting issues and policies that ensure economic and social equity." The coalition is comprised of leaders from civil rights & advocacy organizations, human services, health & community organizations, business, labor, foundations, education, and the media and serves as a private, non-profit, tax-exempt organization.

New Detroit, Inc. is a unique and valuable coalition where Southeast Michigan's leaders come together to plan cooperative strategies and to demonstrate their commitment to the region. The coalition works to impact the actions of individuals and institutions by serving in a number of roles: advocate, catalyst, convener, and facilitator. Through advocacy and leadership by example, New Detroit has demonstrated new ways for solving specific community problems, as well as provide resources to community-based groups.
