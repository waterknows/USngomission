Since 1973, Volunteers Enlisted to Assist People (VEAP) has provided services to help low-income individuals and families meet their immediate needs and attain stability. VEAP serves the communities of Bloomington, Edina, Richfield and south Minneapolis through a mix of professional and volunteer services. Sixty-seven percent of all households served have a monthly income of $1,200 or less and 59% have children under the age of 18 living in the home. VEAP's four programs--Food, Children and Youth, Transportation and Social Services--can help avoid a financial crisis such as loss of housing. In 2014, with the help of over 1,700 volunteers, VEAP served over 19,000 unduplicated individuals representing an increase of more than 2,000 over 2013. This is due in part to VEAP's new facility, which opened in January 2014. VEAP's tenant is Hennepin County's Human Services and Public Health Department. This innovative public-private partnership leverages the unique resources of both agencies and focuses on the collective client outcomes.
