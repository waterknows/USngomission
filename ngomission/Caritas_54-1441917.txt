Incorporated in 1987, CARITAS mobilizes Greater Richmond through its congregations to protect individuals and families in crisis and empowers those who strive for housing independence. We have served many people in need and have brought together thousands of members in our community that might otherwise continued to live estranged from one another spiritually, geographically, socially, and economically. We remain confident that CARITAS will continue to evolve and improve as people of faith partner with people in crisis for the betterment of one another.
