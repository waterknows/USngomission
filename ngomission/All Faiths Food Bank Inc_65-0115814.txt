The mission at All Faiths Food Bank is to solicit, warehouse, process and distribute food to nonprofit agency partners offering hunger relief. The Food Bank reduces food waste by reclaiming the food that might otherwise go into our landfills. It also provides community leadership and education to the community on issues related to food, nutrition and hunger. Volunteers process and store food solicited from the community at the Food Bank's 20,000 square-foot warehouse on Blaikie Ct. in Sarasota. Every can and box of food is sorted and checked by experienced volunteers. Using food bank trucks, All Faiths Food Bank then distributes supplies to nonprofit agencies offering hunger relief in Sarasota and DeSoto counties.
