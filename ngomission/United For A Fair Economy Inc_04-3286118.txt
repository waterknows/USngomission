Founded in 1994, United for a Fair Economy (UFE) is a movement support organization, providing media capacity, face-to-face economic literacy education, and training resources to organizations and individuals who work to address the widening income and asset gaps in our country. We envision communities and nations that do not have dramatic disparities of income, wages, wealth, health, safety, respect, and opportunities for recreation and personal growth. We are dedicated to supporting a movement towards a powerful fair economy through education, campaigns that build power to change policy, and creative tactics that infuse the economic justice movement with vision, humor, and hope.
