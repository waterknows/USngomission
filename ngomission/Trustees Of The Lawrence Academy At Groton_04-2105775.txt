Founded in 1793, Lawrence Academy is a college-preparatory school that, after educating students for more than 200 years, confidently redefines the quest for academic excellence, starting with the interdisciplinary Ninth Grade Program and continuing with student-centered course offerings that empower students to take ownership for their educational success. Teachers who genuinely enjoy working with and connecting with young people challenge our students to take constructive risks as they develop academic and personal attributes we value. Our goal is to inspire all our students to develop both creative and analytical skills, which are essential to successful learning, while supporting them as they accept responsibility for who they are and what kind of people they want to become.
