Special Olympics Louisiana began in 1968 when 11 athletes from Belle Chasse State School competed in the first International Special Olympics Games in Chicago. The mission of Special Olympics is to provide year-round sports training and athletic competition in a variety of Olympic-type sports for all children and adults with intellectual disabilities, giving them continuing opportunities to develop physical fitness, demonstrate courage, experience joy, and participate in a sharing of gifts, skills and friendship with their families, other Special Olympics athletes and the community. Currently, more than 13,500 children and adults with intellectual disabilities in Louisiana participate in more than 100 local competitions in the 13 SOLA Areas and state-level competitions.
