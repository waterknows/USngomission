The mission of the Sun Valley Summer Symphony is to provide exceptional, free-admission classical music performances that inspire and enrich lives through dynamic and engaging artistic programming and educational and cultural opportunities. The Sun Valley Summer Symphony has a variety of education programs for music students of all ages. The School of Music is in its 14th year and the Summer Music Workshops celebrates its 16th anniversary season this summer. As part of the Sun Valley Summer Symphony adult education programs, the community is invited to learn about music to be performed through Upbeat With Alasdair talks given throughout the year and Concert Preview talks given during the symphony season.
