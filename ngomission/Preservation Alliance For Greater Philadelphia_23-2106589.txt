The Preservation Alliance for Greater Philadelphia actively promotes the appreciation, protection, and appropriate use and development of the Philadelphia region's historic buildings, communities and landscapes. Our task is not simply to protect the past; it is also to build public appreciation and support for the distinctive historic character of the city of Philadelphia and surrounding communities, and the assets that contribute to that character. The Alliance is also a public advocate for preservation policies and laws. No other organization performs these functions in the city of Philadelphia; no other organization takes as its mission cooperative efforts with preservation organization in all the Pennsylvania counties adjacent to Philadelphia to achieve these same objectives.
