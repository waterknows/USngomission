The Arts & Science Council (ASC) serves and supports Charlotte-Mecklenburg's cultural community through grant-making, planning, programs and services to ensure a vibrant community enriched with arts, science and history. Organized in 1958, ASC combines resources from the Annual Fund Drive, allocations from local, state and federal governments, and its endowment to support cultural organizations, educational programs and individual artists throughout the region. ASC also provides cultural support through the Cultural Project Grant program, helping to fund neighborhood and community-based projects involving arts, science, history or heritage.
