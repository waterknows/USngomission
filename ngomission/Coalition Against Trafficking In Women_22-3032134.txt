Coalition Against Trafficking in Women (CATW) works to end human trafficking and the commercial sexual exploitation of women and children worldwide. CATW is the world's first organization to fight human trafficking internationally and is the world's leading abolitionist organization. A unique strength of CATW is that we engage in advocacy, education, victim services and prevention programs for victims of trafficking and prostitution in Asia, Africa, Latin America, Europe, and North America, including in the United States. Since 1988, CATW has provided widely recognized leadership in promoting legislative, policy and educational measures to raise awareness about the root causes of human trafficking.
