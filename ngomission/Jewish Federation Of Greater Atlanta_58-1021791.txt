The Jewish Federation of Greater Atlanta helps support a network of social and humanitarian agencies in Atlanta, Israel, and communities around the world. We strive to provide a voice for Atlanta's 100,000-member Jewish community. We are here for the children and the elderly, for people with disabilities and the poor, for the sick and the lost and the forgotten. From day care to healthcare, from job training to Jewish education, from community service to at-risk counseling to immigrant resettlement, we care for the vulnerable, rescue the imperiled and revitalize the human spirit. The Jewish Federation of Greater Atlanta is the backbone of the Jewish community in Atlanta and a vital link in the Jewish chain around the world.
