Founded in 1982, CHOICE (Center for Humanitarian Outreach and Inter-Cultural Exchange) Humanitarian is ending poverty by focusing on sustainable village development. Our goal is to connect motivated villages to resources and tools to change their lives. By building skills, capacities and leadership of the villagers - the entire community brings itself out of the cycle of poverty. Over the last 30 years, we have worked in over 15 countries throughout the world. We are headquartered in West Jordan, Utah with advisories councils starting throughout North America.
