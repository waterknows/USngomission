Family Legacy Missions International exists to connect American families with the orphaned and vulnerable children of Zambia to proclaim the gospel, transform lives, and rescue orphans. We accomplish our mission through our three main ministries: Camp LIFE, Father's Heart, and Tree of Life. Camp LIFE is a week-long camp held throughout the summer for orphaned and vulnerable children in Zambia, Africa. Each summer over 600 Americans come to Zambia for to spend one week leading a group of 10 Zambian children. A Father's Heart Sponsorship allows individuals and families to sponsor children and continue the impact in a child's life long after they return home from Camp LIFE. The Tree of Life Children's Village, located just outside the capital city of Lusaka, is a 130-acre community of homes for orphaned children designed to be a haven of hope and light.
