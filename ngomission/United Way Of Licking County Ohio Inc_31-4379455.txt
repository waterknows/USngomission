Founded in 1973, the United Way of Licking County has completed multiple community assessments in an effort to continue identifying community needs and priorities. The number of programs they fund has increased to 56 programs at 24 agencies, including five of their original partner agencies. In 2008, United Way celebrated its 75th Anniversary of meeting the needs of our community's residents. United Way will continue to serve as an active leader in Licking County to identify needs and bring the resources together to meet those needs.
