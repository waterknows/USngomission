The Access Fund is the national advocacy organization that keeps U.S. climbing areas open and conserves the climbing environment. Founded in 1991, the Access Fund supports and represents over 2.3 million climbers nationwide in all forms of climbing: rock, ice, mountaineering, and bouldering. Five core programs support the mission on national and local levels: climbing management policy; local support & mobilization; stewardship & conservation; land acquisition & protection; and education. The Access Fund is involved in projects at hundreds of climbing areas around the country - working to reverse or prevent closures, reducing climbers' environmental impacts, and educating land managers and the general public as to the special concerns and needs of climbers.
