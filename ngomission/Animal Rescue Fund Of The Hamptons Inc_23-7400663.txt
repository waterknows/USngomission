The Animal Rescue Fund of the Hamptons (ARF) provides for the welfare of dogs and cats on the South Fork of Long Island through shelter and adoption services, medical care, spaying and neutering programs, community outreach and humane education. Founded in 1974, ARF has rescued and placed over 13,000 cats and dogs in loving homes. At any given time, ARF has over 100 animals in residence. ARF is a 'no-kill' adoption center. ARF will care for an animal regardless of how long it takes to find a loving home, except in extraordinary circumstances, such as incurable illness or severe and dangerous behavioral problems. In such cases, a cat or dog may be euthanized.
