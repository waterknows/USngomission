The Jackie Robinson Foundation (JRF) is a national organization founded by Rachel Robinson in 1973 as a vehicle to perpetuate the legacy of Jackie Robinson and his achievements. Serving as an advocate for young people with the greatest need, the Foundation assists increasing numbers of minority youths through the granting of four-year scholarships for higher education. The JRF provides much more than financial support. While each Jackie Robinson Scholar receives up to $7,500 a year in financial support, they also become an active member in the Foundation's unique Education and Leadership Development Program, which is an extensive mentoring program. JRF Scholars maintain a 97% graduation rate - more than twice the national average for minority students.
