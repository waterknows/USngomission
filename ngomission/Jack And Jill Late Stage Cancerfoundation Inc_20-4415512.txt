JAJF has become exceptionally—even profoundly important because of the lives we are ALL truly impacting across the United States. When a parent is diagnosed with late-stage cancer, a family's world is immediately turned upside down. Our supporters appreciate these children who are facing the imminent loss of their Moms and or Dads deserve a timeout from cancer to create cherished, lasting (indispensable) memories as a family… while they can. For JAJF to be “prescribed” by Oncologists across the United States as part of the treatment process and protocol is extraordinary. JAJF has now treated families from 44 states. Sadly, it is just too easy for us to find young Moms and Dads in their 20's, 30's and 40's dying from cancer (despite the advances in research) leaving behind their children. We gain our families strictly from Oncologist referrals.
