Founded in 1952, Guardians of the Sick, devoted to human wellness, builds upon the Biblical values of compassion and community service. It will continue to help hospital patients, the elderly, at-risk children and the disadvantaged, and to alleviate the peripheral burdens of adversity that devolve upon these families, thereby strengthening the fabric of life in our community, our State, and our Country. Guardians of the Sick, also known as Bikur Cholim Chesed Organization, was established and by Holocaust survivors with the mission to assist the sick and needy with financial assistance, emotional help and supportive services. Over the next five decades, the organization has metamorphosed into a comprehensive provider of a full range of social and supportive health services to families in the community who are in crisis or facing financial, health, or other challenges.
