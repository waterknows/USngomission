Riveredge Nature Center was one of the first and today is one of the largest nature centers in southeastern Wisconsin. It consists of 370 acres of natural sanctuary - prairies, forests, ponds and marshes along the Milwaukee River. Established in January 1968, the Riveredge Nature Center works to inspire, inform and enable responsible environmental decision-making. We do this by: providing leadership in environmental education for people of all ages about their interrelationship with the earth and its plant and animal life; preserving the earth's natural sanctuary; serving as a regional resource for scientific research; and integrating sustainability concepts and practices into its programming to inspire people to live within the limitations of natural systems.
