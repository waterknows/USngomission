Californians for Population Stabilization (CAPS) works to formulate and advance policies and programs designed to stabilize the population of California at a level which will preserve a good quality of life for all Californians. Founded in 1986, CAPS works to preserve California's future through the stabilization of our state's human population. Since nearly all of California's population growth comes from immigration, CAPS focuses largely on this issue: sponsoring public and media awareness campaigns, working with lawmakers to promote more responsible policies, maintaining a growing network of member-activists, and conducting vital research. CAPS is confronting the most important issue facing California and the United States: runaway population growth.
