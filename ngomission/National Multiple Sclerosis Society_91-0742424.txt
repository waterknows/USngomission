The National MS Society, Greater Northwest Chapter educates, inspires and empowers those affected by multiple sclerosis. We break down barriers - both physical and emotional - in the home, in the workplace and in the community. We build confidence that people with MS can live the best possible lives as individuals, as family members, as employees and as members of the larger community. No other local MS organization provides the breadth and depth of services or involves more people in the movement to bring about a world free of MS. Headquartered in Seattle, the Chapter serves over 12,000 people living with MS and more than 72,000 others whose lives are directly impacted (family members, friends, co-workers and caregivers) inAlaska, Montana, Western and Central Washington.
