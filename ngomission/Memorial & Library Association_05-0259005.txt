The mission of the Westerly Library and Wilcox Park is to stimulate the intellect and imagination by providing access to literature, information, nature and the arts. The library first opened its doors to the public in 1894 and is located in the heart of downtown Westerly, Rhode Island. The Library is open 65 hours each week, and the collection includes books, magazines, compact discs, DVDs and videos, all totaling more than 170,000 items. The Westerly Public Library is a great resource for the community -- it has something for everyone of every age.
