Team RFC was established in 1978 as a fellowship for Christians in the sport of motor racing, and has developed into a growing organization with broad impact across North America and beyond. The overall purpose of RFC's involvement in motor racing is to service emotional and spiritual needs. RFC is an outreach of Christian Motorsports International, a family of ministries that conducts non-denominational chapel services at major racing events nationwide, providing pre-race chapel services, invocations, and a pastoral presence for more than 1,600 racing events each racing year -- including drag racing, open wheel racing, motorcycle racing, boat racing, stock car racing, off-road racing, airplane racing, and street rodding events.
