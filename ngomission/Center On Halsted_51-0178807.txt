Chicago has long been the center of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community in the greater Midwest, and in 2001 a dedicated group of community leaders came together and shared a vision to create a united front and a focal point for this burgeoning community. Through their vision and dedication, Center on Halsted became a reality in 2007, bringing a wide array of LGBT organizations and resources in the city together to collaborate, share resources and extend their reach. As the most comprehensive LGBT community center in the Midwest, our mission is simple: In a safe and nurturing environment, the Center on Halsted serves as a catalyst for the LGBT community that links and provides community resources and enriches life experiences.
