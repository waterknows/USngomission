Since its inception in 1909, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has strived to ensure the political, educational, social and economic equality of rights of all persons and to eliminate racial hatred and racial discrimination. The objectives of the NAACP are to achieve equality of rights and eliminate race prejudice among the citizens of the United States; remove all barriers of racial discrimination through democratic processes; seek enactment and enforcement of federal, state and local laws securing civil rights; inform the public of the adverse effects of racial discrimination and to seek its elimination; and to educate persons as to their constitutional rights and to take all lawful action to secure the exercise of these rights.
