Homeward Bound of Marin's mission of opening doors to safety, dignity, hope and independence is coupled with a vision that everyone deserves a place to call home. Homeward Bound is Marin County's chief provider of shelter and residential services for homeless families and individuals, serving approximately 1,200 people per year in 15 inter-related residential programs. Our overarching goal is to end homelessness in Marin County. To that end, we offer supportive services designed to end homelessness in the life of every person served, whatever their circumstances. Our residents have built an admirable record of success in one of the country's toughest housing markets: in 2014-15, 86% of families served and 58% of adults completing our programs moved to stable housing despite enormous personal and economic challenges.
