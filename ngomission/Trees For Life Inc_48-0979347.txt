Trees for Life International's work started in the early 1980s with the planting of fruit trees in India. The emphasis was on creating awareness, training people to plant and take care of trees, and providing them with the resources needed to accomplish their tasks. Each recipient made a pledge to help at least two others in the same manner in which they had been helped. But far more important than the number of trees planted is the fact that tree planting inspires many people to do more to help themselves. They have started projects on bee-keeping, fuel-efficient stoves, improvement of their soils, water conservation, scientific improvement of plant breeding materials, self-help loans, improvement of medical facilities, improvement of educational facilities and other socially responsible activities.
