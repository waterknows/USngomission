We inspire, encourage and support Santa Barbara County students in their pursuit of college, graduate, and vocational education through financial aid advising and scholarships. Beginning with nine $100 book awards in 1962, we have grown to award $8.7million in student aid for the 2015-16 academic year.The Scholarship Foundation of Santa Barbara reached 37,653 students, parents, and educators in 2013-14 through financial aid and scholarship presentations and financial aid advising sessions at school sites and our offices. This is a 7% increase in services over 2012-2013. Staff attended 1,444 outreach events, an increase of 3% over the prior year.
