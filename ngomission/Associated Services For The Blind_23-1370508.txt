The Associated Services for the Blind and Visually Impaired (ASB) started as the Pennsylvania Working Home for Blind Men in 1874 and now more than 125 years later, it is the largest nonprofit organization serving the needs of people who are blind or visually impaired in the Delaware Valley, which includes Southeastern Pennsylvania, Southern New Jersey and Northern Delaware. ASB promotes self-esteem, independence and self-determination in people who are blind or visually impaired. ASB accomplishes this by providing support through education, training and resources, as well as through community action and public education, serving as a voice and advocate for the rights of all people who are blind or visually impaired.
