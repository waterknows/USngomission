The North Lakeland Discovery Center is a place where people can come to connect to the natural world. Our location in the Northwoods of Wisconsin is beautifully remote, surrounded by water and forests, and yet accessible to visitors. Our mission is to enrich lives and inspire an ethic of care for Wisconsin's Northwoods, through the facilitation of connections among nature, people and community. NLDC can be described as a nature-based education and community center. Our market is regional, appealing to people who live, own second homes and vacation in Wisconsin's Northwoods. An expanding market is organized groups interested in nature-recreation opportunities and programs. These include groups such as Conservation Leadership Camp and Urban Ecology Center.
