The Museum of Glass provides a dynamic learning environment to appreciate the medium of glass through creative experiences, collections and exhibitions. Housed in a striking building distinguished by its iconic 90-foot-high cone, the Museum of Glass features ongoing glassblowing demonstrations in the Hot Shop Amphitheater, where visitors learn about the creative challenges of working with molten glass. The 13,000 square feet of gallery space is dedicated to changing exhibitions of works executed in glass. A hands-on art studio is available for visitors of all ages, our theater shows a variety of films on artists who work in glass, and the Museum Store offers a large selection of glass objects. The Museum is located on the picturesque Thea Foss Waterway and is part of the Tacoma Museum District, which is linked by the Chihuly Bridge of Glass.
