Anderson Animal Shelter (AAS) was incorporated in 1966 as the Humane Society of North Central Illinois. The mission of AAS is to continue to serve as a premier private facility dedicated to the compassionate and humane treatment of homeless companion animals through direct care, education and community outreach programs. Anderson Animal Shelter is dedicated to the welfare of companion animals and their human caregivers. AAS currently serves approximately 3,000 animals each year. The shelter operates under a low-kill philosophy and is dedicated to eliminating the euthanasia of healthy, adoptable animals. Every adoptable animal at the shelter is cared for as long as it takes to locate a loving forever home.
