Carriage Town Ministries is a Christian Social Services organization established in 1950 to represent Christ in the Flint, Michigan area as it reaches out to the needy or our community. The mission's purpose is to share the Lord Jesus Christ with the homeless women, children, and men of our community through providing food, shelter, clothing and education while encouraging accountability, growth, and ultimately service back to God. While many changes and improvements have taken place since the inception of the mission, there is one thing that has not changed, the desire to reach out to the last, the least, and the lost with the message of hope through Jesus Christ. The purpose of the mission has always been to see lives changed through the power of the Holy Spirit.
