The Children's Cancer and Blood Foundation (CCBF), through its support of the Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology at the New York - Presbyterian Hospital Weill Cornell Medical Center, has created a standard of excellence in the treatment of children with chronic, life-threatening blood disorders since 1952. Children and their families receive the most advanced, comprehensive care provided by a team of pediatric specialists in an atmosphere of compassion, hope and wellness. Since our founding, CCBF funding has helped revolutionize the treatment of children suffering from cancers and childhood blood disorders.
