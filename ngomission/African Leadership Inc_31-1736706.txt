African Leadership serves leaders who matter in the hard places. With a presence in over 20 countries, African Leadership erodes the barriers of inaccessible and unaffordable pastoral education by bringing a two-year, college-level program to pastors in their own communities for either a modest fee or free of cost depending on individual circumstances. Classes are African-led and walk through applied theological education and community investment programs tailored to African issues and ideas. The continent-wide network of over 50,000 graduates is pastoring and planting churches, implementing solutions to community-identified problems, and making God's kingdom present today and through all time.
