The mission of Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) is to stop drunk driving, support the victims of this violent crime and prevent underage drinking. When MADD was founded in 1980, drunk driving was considered socially acceptable behavior despite the fact over 22,000 people were being killed annually in drunk driving crashes on America's roadways. Since that time, drunk driving fatalities have declined by more than half and more 300,000 lives have been saved. Our Campaign to Eliminate Drunk Driving focuses on three components: - Support high-visibility law enforcement to catch drunk drivers and discourage others from driving drunk.- Require ignition interlock devices, or in-car breathalyzers, for all drunk drivers, to prove they are sober before their car will start.- Support the development of technology to determine automatically whether or not the driver is above the legal limit of .08 and failing to operate if the driver is drunk.
