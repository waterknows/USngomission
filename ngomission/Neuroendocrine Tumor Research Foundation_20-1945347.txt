The mission of the Caring for Carcinoid Foundation (CFCF) is to fund research to discover cures and more effective treatments for carcinoid, pancreatic, and related neuroendocrine cancers. To achieve rapid discovery of cures, CFCF directs its donations to fund breakthrough scientific research of neuroendocrine cancers. Since its inception, CFCF has awarded over $10 million in large-scale, multi-year research grants to leading scientists at renowned research institutions. CFCF also works to provide educational resources and conferences to patients and caregivers affected by these relatively rare cancers.
