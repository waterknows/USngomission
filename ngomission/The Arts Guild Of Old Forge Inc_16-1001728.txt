View is dedicated to making the visual and performing arts an integral and accessible part of the lives of residents and visitors of the Adirondacks, inspired by and reflecting the beauty of our natural environment.



View fulfills this mission year-round through;



- An extensive offering of exhibitions of regional and national interest and impact, with a special emphasis on the presentation of the work of living artists, and

- Workshops and classes, public performances, lectures, and other activities for personal enrichment and involvement, and



- Space where artists and performers can develop and share their talents.



In so doing, View will serve as a catalyst for encouraging the creative spirit that has long been an Adirondack tradition.
