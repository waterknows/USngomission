Dedication and Everlasting Love to Animals (D.E.L.T.A.) reaches over three million people a year to educate them with regard to the plight of animals, and to encourage them not to abandon their pets. We rescue abandoned animals and care for over 1,500 of them at the largest animal rescue sanctuary in the world, and we also support rescue programs outside of the United States. In addition, we develop, produce, and distribute documentary, instructional and feature projects. These projects are meant to increase global awareness of the plight of animals, to teach specific skills regarding animal care, and to encourage individual to rescue and care for animals.
