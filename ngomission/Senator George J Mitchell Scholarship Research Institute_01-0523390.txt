The core mission of the Mitchell Institute is to increase the likelihood that young people from every community in Maine will aspire to, pursue and achieve a college education. Each year, a Mitchell Scholarship is awarded to a graduating senior from every public high school in Maine who will be attending a two-or four-year postsecondary degree program. Selection is based on academic promise, financial need and a history of community service. The Mitchell Scholarship Program has awarded more than $12 million in financial assistance to more than 2,400 Maine students since 1995. Mitchell Institute support programs create ongoing Scholar involvement in leadership and professional development, as well as community service and mentoring activities.
