The Minnesota Opera's mission is to produce opera and opera education programs at the highest artistic level that inspire and entertain our audiences and enrich the cultural life of our community. Now regarded as America's most exciting opera company, The Minnesota Opera was founded as Center Opera in 1963 when the Walker Art Center commissioned an opera for its performing arts program. At the start of the 21st century, The Minnesota Opera is enjoying unprecedented stability and unity of mission. Now the 15th largest opera company in the nation, The Minnesota Opera prides itself in creating a new, dynamic opera company model based upon innovation, world-class artistic quality and strong community service. The Minnesota Opera performs at Ordway Center for the Performing Arts in downtown St. Paul, Minnesota.
