The American Lung Association of the Mountain Pacific's mission is to save lives by improving lung health and preventing lung disease. We cover a seven state region including the states of Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington and Wyoming. The American Lung Association was founded in 1904 and organized to combat a single disease - tuberculosis. Today, our goals include reducing tobacco use, especially among young people; preventing and controlling indoor and outdoor air pollution; and providing education and funding research to treat and cure lung disease. We work to assure lung health for the people of our region through research, education, community service and advocacy.
