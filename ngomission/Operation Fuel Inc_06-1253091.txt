Founded in 1977, Operation Fuel provides emergency energy assistance to state residents who do not qualify for, or have exhausted, their government assistance. Most of our clients are not poor enough to receive government aid but, because of a crisis in their lives, cannot make ends meet and are forced to make impossible choices. Trying to survive a Connecticut winter with no heat should not be one of their choices. Operation Fuel uses a network of over 100 community organizations which approve grants to pay the utility bills of households in need. They are town social service agencies, community action agencies, non-profit organizations such as Catholic Charities, and religious organizations. These agencies voluntarily administer this energy assistance program.
