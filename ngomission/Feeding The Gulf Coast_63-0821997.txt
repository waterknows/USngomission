Feeding the Gulf Coast (FTGC) incorporated in 1981, in Mobile, Alabama. In 1988, FTGC became a certified member of Feeding America, the nation's food bank network. Since its founding, FTGC has distributed over 180 million pounds of food to charitable feeding organizations across the 24 counties it serves - including nine counties in south Alabama, eight counties in south Mississippi and seven counties in the Florida panhandle. FTGC is prepared for its role as a primary food source for the Central Gulf Coast in disaster relief operations. The food bank operates various nutrition programs for low-income families including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and multiple child nutrition programs for children living in low income families. Since the first child nutrition program started in January 2003, these programs have continued to expand and now include over 135 Afterschool Snack and Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) sites supporting nearly 20,000 children annually.
