The Providence Rescue Mission works to reach the homeless and needy of Rhode Island's urban centers with the Gospel of Jesus Christ while providing physical, emotional, educational and rehabilitative services at no expense to those in need. We conduct chapel service followed by an evening meal seven nights a week, provide overnight shelter for homeless men and women, a food pantry, clothing room, education and career center, and a one-year discipleship program for homeless men. Each of these services provides for specific needs of the community we serve.
