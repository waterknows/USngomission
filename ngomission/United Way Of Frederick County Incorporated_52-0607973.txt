Founded in 1938, the United Way of Frederick County (UWFC) exists to unite local resources to provide the most effective response to community issues in Frederick County. We aim to build a community where everyone has the aspirations, resources and opportunities to reach their potential. UWFC is focusing on the building blocks for a good life: helping children and youth achieve their potential through education, helping families become financially stable and independent, and improving people's health.
