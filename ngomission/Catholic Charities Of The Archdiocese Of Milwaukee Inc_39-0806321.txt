The majority of our clients are low-income individuals and families, many living under the national poverty level. To date in 2015, we have served over 35,000 individuals. Our programs help individuals and families in crisis situations, addressing personal needs and aiding clients on the road to self-sufficiency and wellness.Our programs include: Community Outreach & Case Management, Behavioral Health Counseling, Pregnancy Support Coordination, Adoption, Supported Parenting Services, In-Home Support, Adult Day Services, Refugee Resettlement, and Legal Services for Immigrants..As a non-profit, we have an ethical obligation to our constituents and the public to conduct our activities with accountability and transparency. We wish to regularly and openly convey information to the public about our mission, activities, accomplishments and decision-making processes. Because we want this information to be easily accessible to the public with external visibility, important documentation regarding our agency's functions is shared on our website. It is listed under the Get To Know Us tab/Agency Transparency.
