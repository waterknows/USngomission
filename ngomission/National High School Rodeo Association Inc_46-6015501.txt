The National High School Rodeo Association was created to give high school students the opportunity to participate and compete in this unique and challenging sport. Although not recognized by high school athletics, the NHSRA offers a rodeo program that sets high school rodeo apart from other varsity sports: Athletes compete on a scale comparable to collegiate and professional rodeo competitors. The NHSRA is an independent student athletic association -- governing itself without supervision of school administrations or assistance from tax dollars. Members are fully insured, supervised and guided by adult experts. Competitors have the opportunity to acquire scholarships and grants for continuing their educational careers.
