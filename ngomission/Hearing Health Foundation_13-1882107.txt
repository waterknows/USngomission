Hearing Health Foundation, formerly known as Deafness Research Foundation, is the leading national source of private funding for research in hearing and balance science. The mission of Hearing Health Foundation is to prevent and cure hearing loss and tinnitus through groundbreaking research. Since its founding in 1958, Hearing Health Foundation has awarded approximately 2,000 grants, totaling nearly $30 million. Hearing Health Foundation-funded research has led to dramatic innovations in hearing and balance science, such as: cochlear implants, universal newborn hearing screening, surgical therapy for otosclerosis, hair cell regeneration, and auditory research. Our new groundbreaking initiative, the Hearing Restoration Project (HRP), aims to find a cure for many types of hearing loss and tinnitus in the next decade. HRP is a 'dream team' of scientists who are working daily to find ways to regenerate hair cell growth in the human ear to restore hearing loss.
