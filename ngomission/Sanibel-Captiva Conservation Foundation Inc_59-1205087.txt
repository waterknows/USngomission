The Sanibel-Captiva Conservation Foundation (SCCF) is dedicated to the conservation of coastal habitats and aquatic resources on Sanibel and Captiva and in the surrounding watershed. Since incorporating in 1967, SCCF has acquired and preserved approximately 2,000 acres of environmentally sensitive land on the islands. This land includes critical wildlife habitats, rare and unique subtropical plant communities, tidal wetlands, and freshwater wetlands along the Sanibel River. Without protection, many of these areas would have been lost to residential and commercial development, either directly or by fragmentation of habitat. Seven priority program areas forward its mission: environmental education, land acquisition, landscaping for wildlife, marine research, natural resource policy, sea turtle conservation, and wildlife habitat management.
