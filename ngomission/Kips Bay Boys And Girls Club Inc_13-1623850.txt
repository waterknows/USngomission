Since 1915, Kips Bay Boys & Girls Club has been in the business of promoting juvenile development and preventing juvenile delinquency among the youth of New York City. In pursuit of this mission, Kips Bay is organized to help young people recognize and achieve their potential for growth and development and to attain the skills necessary for living in a complex urban environment. We offer an extensive variety of after school and summer programs and services for young people ages 6-18.
