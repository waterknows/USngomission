The Boomer Esiason Foundation (BEF) is a dynamic partnership of leaders in the medical and business communities joining with a committed core of volunteers to heighten awareness, education and the quality of life for those affected by cystic fibrosis, while providing financial support to research aimed at finding a cure. Boomer Esiason was a star NFL quarterback in 1993 when he learned his young son, Gunnar, was afflicted with the deadly disease cystic fibrosis. Boomer and his wife, Cheryl, are strongly committed to supporting the critical research needed to discover a cure for CF and to improving the quality of life for the 30,000 Americans living with the disease. BEF works to directly affect the lives of CF patients around the country through scholarships and transplant grants to aid families.
