In the words of New York Times' critic Ben Brantley, Mint Theater is the “resurrectionist extraordinaire of forgotten plays.” We scour the dramaturgical dustbin for worthwhile plays from the past that have been lost or neglected—and we create new life for them through production, publication, and educational initiatives. The Mint was founded in 1992. Jonathan Bank became artistic director in 1995 and began to shape the company's mission, focusing on lost plays. Our first major success came in 1999 with the American premiere of THE VOYSEY INHERITANCE, written by Harley Granville-Barker in 1905. “A playwright, and a company, couldn't do much better,” wrote the New York Times. Our work has been recognized with an Obie Grant (2001), a special Drama Desk Award (2002), and the Theater History Museum's Theatre Preservation Award (2010) along with a host of Drama Desk and Lucille Lortel Award nominations. In fulfilling our mission, we've created some the most compelling theater in New York. As Gwen Orel wrote in the Irish Examiner “We are lucky in New York to have the Mint here. If all they did was find and stage these plays, it would be enough, but what they do is reincarnate them into striking works of art.”
