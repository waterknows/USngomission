The Cancer Coalition of South Georgia works to prevent cancer and increase survival among the people of South Georgia. We accomplish through community-based services, education, research and outreach - all done with compassion and in collaboration with others who are concerned about cancer. The Cancer Coalition of South Georgia began as a collaboration of diverse stakeholders with a singular purpose: to fight cancer in our region. Its enduring partnerships and steadfast focus remain the foundation to achieving the Cancer Coalition's mission.
