Since its founding in 1883, the Allen-Stevenson school has been dedicated to providing the very best elementary education for boys growing up in New York City. Allen-Stevenson's vigorous, pre-secondary program of academics, athletics, and the arts teaches boys to value the gratifying process by which excellence is attained. By creating a joyful, safe environment for learning, the School seeks to ensure a productive, diverse community of learners. We challenge our students to take suitable risks, learn from their mistakes, and support each other. Ultimately, we encourage boys to move through life strongly and rightly - with confidence, knowledge, enthusiasm, resilience, and respect for all.
