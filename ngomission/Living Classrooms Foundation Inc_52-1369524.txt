Living Classrooms Foundation strengthens communities and inspires young people to achieve their potential through hands-on education and job training, using urban, natural, and maritime resources as "living classrooms." Living Classrooms Foundation is a Baltimore-Washington based non-profit educational organization with a distinctive competency in experiential learning - literally learning by direct experience, or what we call "learning by doing." We educate students through our own charter school, through after-school and supplemental education programs, and through environmental experiences, with special emphasis on serving students who live in high-risk environments. We also eliminate barriers to success for young adults and families through community development, workforce preparation, and life skills training.
