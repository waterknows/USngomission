Northlands Rescue Mission is a place of rescue, relief and restoration for all who come here, no matter their needs or challenges. For the homeless living on the streets, we're a hot meal, a warm bed and a second chance. For the mentally ill, we are a safe harbor that offers compassionate care. For an impoverished family in crisis, we are a source of help and hope. Our Christian-based nonprofit ministry provides homeless men and women in 21 counties in North Dakota and Minnesota with shelter, meals, clothing, spiritual guidance and case management, all delivered in a safe environment, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
