Downline Ministries exists to encourage a restoration of Biblical discipleship in and through the local church by strategically partnering with church leadership to equip men and women to make disciples in their home, church, and community for the glory of God and exaltation of Christ among the nations. Since our goal is to see discipleship restored in the Church at large, we hold tightly to core elements of evangelical Christian faith, while allowing freedom in more nonessential areas of theology that might differ across denominational lines.
