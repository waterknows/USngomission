Founded in 1968, the Samaritan Center for Young Boys and Families is a rural home campus for boys ages 7-12, located in Stuart, on the East Coast of South Florida. Boys live in disciplined home environments with a Christian houseparent family, pursue their academic needs in our on-site private school, and have a chance to become well-directed and productive citizens. The Samaritan Center gives real hope to tragedy-based or behavior-difficult boys during their critical developmental years. We endeavor to redirect boys behaviorally by offering parameters in which to learn accountability, responsibility, and trust. Through consistent Christian instruction, steady work, correction, and encouragement, the boys develop genuine self-esteem and a firm foundation on which to build good lives.
