Founded in 1936, the Capital Area Humane Society works to promote the humane treatment of companion animals through protection, placement, education, and example. We serve the animals and the people of the Mid-Michigan community with a wide variety of programs and services, including adoption, surrender, an off-site spay and neuter clinic, education programs for children, pet health fairs, obedience classes, and a pet food bank. More than 10,000 animals come through our doors each year; all are provided with food, medical care, a safe place to live, and plenty of TLC from our staff and volunteers.
