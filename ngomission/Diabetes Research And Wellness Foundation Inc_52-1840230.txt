The Diabetes Research and Wellness Foundation (DRWF) was founded to help and find the cure for diabetes and until that goal is achieved, to provide the care needed to combat the detrimental and life-threatening complications of this terrible disease. To accomplish this mission DRWF provides funds to researchers whose work has already provided substantial insight into the causes, early detection, or treatment of diabetes complications; encourages and facilitates the development of fledgling researchers in the field of diabetes research; promotes public education about the causes, prevention, and treatment of diabetes and its complications; provides services and products to people with diabetes; and provides hope to millions of diabetes sufferers.
