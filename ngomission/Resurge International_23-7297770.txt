Since 1969, ReSurge International (formerly Interplast) - the first humanitarian organization to provide free reconstructive surgery for children and adults with clefts, disabling burns and hand injuries - has provided 68,000 life-changing surgeries for those who have no other access to care. Working in underserved regions of 16 countries throughout Africa, Asia and Latin America, ReSurge International teaches, empowers and partners with volunteers and overseas medical professionals so every child living in poverty has free access to the safest and highest quality care - now and in the future.
