LIFT's mission is to help community members achieve economic stability and well-being. We are working to establish a new standard for holistic and enduring solutions in our country's fight against poverty.LIFT currently runs centers staffed by trained volunteers in Boston, Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, Washington, DC, and LA to serve low-income individuals and families.LIFT clients and volunteers work one-on-one to find jobs, secure safe and stable housing, make ends meet through public benefits and tax credits, and obtain quality referrals for services like childcare and healthcare. Simultaneously, the LIFT experience pushes volunteers to grapple with our country's most challenging issues related to poverty, race, inequality, and policy. Since LIFT's founding, over 6,000 volunteers have served more than 40,000 individuals and families.
