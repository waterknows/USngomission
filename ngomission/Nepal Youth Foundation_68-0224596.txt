Founded in 1990, the Nepal Youth Foundation (NYF) is devoted to bringing hope to the most destitute children in the beautiful but impoverished Himalayan country of Nepal. With a personal touch, we provide them with what should be every child's birthright - education, housing, medical care, and loving support. Empowered to reach their potential, these children blossom, enriching the world we all share. We raise funds and provide fiscal and other oversight for our programs in Nepal. We stay small and flexible. Our programs are carried out in Nepal by a highly qualified Nepali staff. In Nepal, we work closely with local non-governmental organizations (NGOs), communities, families, and, of course, lots of kids who astonish us every day with their ability to overcome their difficult pasts.
