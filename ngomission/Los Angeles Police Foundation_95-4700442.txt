The Los Angeles Police Foundation (LAPF) is an independent, not-for-profit organization that provides critical resources and vital support to the Los Angeles Police Department. From essential equipment and state-of-the-art technology to specialized training and innovative programs that would otherwise be unfunded, the support we provide directly improves public safety, impacts officer readiness, and enhances our quality of life. As the largest source of private funding for the LAPD, we are passionately dedicated to ensuring that Los Angeles remains America's safest major city. Since 1998, the LAPF has provided nearly $18 million in support to the Los Angeles Police Department.
