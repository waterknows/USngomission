Founded in 1984, the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) is a public policy organization dedicated to advancing the principles of free enterprise and limited government. We believe that individuals are best helped not by government intervention, but by making their own choices in a free marketplace. We are nationally recognized as a leading voice on a broad range of regulatory issues from free market approaches to environmental policy, to antitrust and technology policy, to risk regulation. CEI is not a traditional think tank. We frequently produce groundbreaking research on regulatory issues and we reach out to the public and the media to ensure that our ideas are heard, work with policymakers to ensure that they are implemented and, when necessary, take our arguments to court.
