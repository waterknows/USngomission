Founded in 1831, the mission of the Virginia Historical Society is to collect, preserve, and interpret the commonwealth's past for the education and enjoyment of present and future generations. With education as our primary focus we offer public lectures, seminars, conferences and consulting services; publish teacher resource materials; conduct teacher training and recertification workshops both on- and off-site; arrange school and general group tours and activities; support scholarly research through an endowed fellowship program and minority internships; maintain a museum of changing, permanent, and traveling exhibitions, operate a research library, and a publications program that has functioned uninterrupted for more than 100 years.
