The mission of Hawaii Public Radio (HPR) is to educate, inform and entertain by providing services to Hawaii, the nation and the international community that would not otherwise be available. HPR was founded in the fall of 1981 with the launching of KHPR. Statewide coverage was begun when KKUA's transmitter on Haleakala brought KHPR's signal to Maui and parts of the Big Island in April of 1988. The second program stream, KIPO 89.3 FM, began broadcasting jazz and folk music in October 1989, and a third service, KIFO 1380 AM began broadcasting in 1990, simulcasting with KIPO for the most part.
