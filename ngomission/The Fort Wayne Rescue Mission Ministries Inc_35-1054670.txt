Fort Wayne Rescue Ministries has been faithfully serving God's love to the area's needy since 1903, never charging fees to those who come for help. Daily crisis shelter is provided for up to 150 men, women, and children, as are breakfasts, lunches and dinners for hungry people off the streets. The six-month to two-year restoration programs designed to address the issues that caused their homelessness, include a series of classroom experiences, counseling groups, case management sessions, daily work in our Computer Learning Center, and, of course, many Bible studies and Chapel services. Rescue Ministries today includes The Rescue Mission for men, Charis House for women and their children, and Bargains Galore, our thrift store.
