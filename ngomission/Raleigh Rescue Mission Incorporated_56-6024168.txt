Raleigh Rescue Mission was founded in 1961 to minister to the growing needs of homeless and hurting men, women and children in our community. The Mission offers both a long-term recovery program and emergency shelter. Raleigh Rescue Mission provides safe housing, clothing and three healthy meals a day, as well as recovery, Christian counseling and other support services to help them achieve their goals and ultimately make a successful transition back into the community. The Mission provides free medical care services to residents through our on-site Medical and Pediatric Clinic and preschool age children receive teaching and loving care in our Children's Development Center. Residents receive job and computer skills training, as well as life skills and educational classes, such as GED, in our Adult Learning Center.
