Nevada Humane Society's mission is to find homes and provide care for homeless pets, bringing people and animals together to make Washoe County and Carson City no-kill communities. This is accomplished through quality animal care, comprehensive adoption programs, accessible low-cost spay/neuter services, and a free Animal Help Desk.NHS is a non-profit organization founded in 1932. In 2007, NHS became a no-kill shelter and launched a bold effort to help Washoe County become a no-kill community. In 2014, NHS expanded lifesaving efforts to include Carson City. Today, more than 70,000 animals have been placed into loving homes since 2007 and NHS continues to grow, maintaining its status as one of the top communities in the country for saving homeless pets. Working in partnership with Washoe County Regional Animal Services and a network of rescue organizations, NHS has put Washoe County in the very top tier of communities nationwide.
