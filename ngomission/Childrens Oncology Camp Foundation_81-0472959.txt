Camp Mak-A-Dream was founded in 1991 and began as a dream to bring sick children to see a working Montana ranch. Today, cost-free programs are offered throughout the year to children, teens, young adults and women with cancer, as well as programs for children who have a sibling or a parent with cancer. Since opening their doors, Camp Mak-A-Dream has welcomed more than 5,000 participants from across the United States, Canada, and several other countries. The campus is handicap accessible, including the pool, hot tub, zip line, cabins, restrooms and lodge. The Camp is also able to accommodate the medical needs of those in the midst of treatment due to the support of volunteer physicians and nurses.
