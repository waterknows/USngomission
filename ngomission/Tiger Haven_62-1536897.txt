Established in 1991, Tiger Haven is a sanctuary and rescue facility for big cats, much like an animal shelter for dogs and house cats - except that we are a no kill facility. And, the cats who come here for sanctuary are given a permanent home. They are not sold, transferred or given away. They are not used for breeders, and they don't work for a living. The cats here enjoy the good life, and they deserve it. Tiger Haven is situated on 75 acres of wooded property. Large enclosures fill up about 45 acres and house 278 big cats and 14 lesser cats . A perimeter fence surrounds all the enclosures and living quarters, and a roadway runs between enclosures and around the perimeter fence to facilitate feeding, maintenance and security checks. The enclosures are designed for the cats that will live in them.
