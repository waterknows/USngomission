Founded in 1873, SPCA Cincinnati is an animal shelter and humane society that continually strives to strengthen the human-animal bond and improve the welfare of animals by fostering humane care and treatment of all animals. Through humane education and animal protection, we improve the quality of life in our community. SPCA Cincinnati provides services to Hamilton County and the City of Cincinnati, Ohio. This service area covers a population of over 900,000 people and an area of over 500 square miles. We offer refuge, medical care, nourishment and a second chance for homeless animals; and we protect animals from cruelty, neglect, carelessness, ignorance and irresponsibility.
