ORBIS is a global development organization whose mission is to eliminate avoidable blindness in developing countries. We do this by strengthening the capacity of our local eye health partners to prevent and treat avoidable blindness. Through capacity building, our partners gain self-sufficiency in providing quality eye care, and residents enjoy quality treatment that is affordable, accessible and sustainable. As part of ORBIS's broad-based capacity building program, our organization works with carefully selected local partners on projects typically lasting at least three years. ORBIS has approximately 100 active partners. These include hospitals, health centers, universities and training centers, local non-governmental organizations (NGOs), eye banks and government health departments.
