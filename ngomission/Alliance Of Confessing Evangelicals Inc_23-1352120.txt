The Alliance of Confessing Evangelicals is a coalition of confessional pastors, scholars, and churchmen proclaiming biblical doctrine in order to foster a Reformed awakening in today's Church. We work through media, events, and publishing. Media includes broadcasting: The Bible Study Hour, Every Last Word, Mortification of Spin with Carl Trueman and Todd Pruitt, No Falling Word, and Dr. Barnhouse & the Bible with Donald Barnhouse. Events include the Philadelphia Conference on Reformed Theology, regional events, and Reformation Societies who continue to encourage, embolden, and equip church leaders. Place for Truth is our online magazine - a free, "go-to" theological resource. Christward Collective is a theological conversation equipping believers for growth. And reformation21 provides cultural and church critic. Think and Act Biblically and Making God's Word Plain are our online daily devotionals. Other resources include MatthewHenry.org, Alliance Books, as well as CDs and MP3s.
