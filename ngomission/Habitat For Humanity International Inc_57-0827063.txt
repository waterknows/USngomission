Habitat for Humanity of Greenville County seeks to put God's love into action by bringing people together to build homes, communities and hope. We believe that affordable homeownership is foundational for creating family stability, ensuring academic success for children and eliminating generational poverty .Since 1985, Habitat for Humanity of Greenville County has been helping working, low-income families attain homeownership. Partnering with businesses, corporations, churches, civic organizations, and volunteers, Habitat Greenville builds homes which meet Energy Star and NAHB ICC-700 green building standards. Homes are sold to qualified families earning 30%-60% of the area median income (AMI) who meet Habitat's criteria for partnership. This includes completion of the organization's homeowner preparation program and fulfillment of 200 hours of "sweat equity" helping build Habitat homes.
