Helping Hands: Monkey Helpers for the Disabled is a non-profit organization that helps adults with spinal cord injuries and other mobility impairments live more independent and engaged lives. We do this by providing them, free of charge, with a unique service animal: a highly trained capuchin monkey to help with their daily tasks. The only organization of our kind, we raise and train these special service animals, carefully match them with appropriate recipients across the nation, and provide active support and care for the duration of each placement.Since 1979, Helping Hands and our monkey helpers have given recipients the priceless gifts of greater independence, companionship, and hope.
