Founded in 1982, Valley Interfaith Food & Clothing Center (VIFCC) is the preeminent volunteer organization in the upper Millcreek Valley, dedicated to helping the less fortunate in our thirteen-community area. We work to assist our neighbors in need with food, clothing, emergency financial assistance and other necessary services by linking willing and able clients with resources which will help them break their cycle of dependency, and provide them with a new beginning.
