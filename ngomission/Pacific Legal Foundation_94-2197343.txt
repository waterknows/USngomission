Established in 1973, Pacific Legal Foundation is the oldest and most successful public interest legal organization that fights for limited government, property rights, individual rights and a balanced approach to environmental protection. PLF is devoted to a vision of individual freedom, responsible government, and color-blind justice. PLF's litigation focuses on three major projects: to defend the fundamental human right of private property; to promote sensible environmental policies that respect individual freedom and put people first; and to create a nation in which people are judged by the content of their character. In addition, PLF's Economic Liberty and Free Enterprise Projects are devoted to protecting the right to earn a living, and protect businesses against unfair burdens.
