Central Scholarship is devoted to helping individuals achieve a better life through higher education. We believe that education is a right, not a privilege and that scholarships are an investment, not an expense. Founded in 1924, we award scholarships and interest-free loans to students pursuing higher education. Through Central Scholarship, students are able to afford tuition and fulfill their potential.
