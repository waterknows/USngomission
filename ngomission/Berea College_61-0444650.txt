Founded in 1855 as the first interracial and co-educational college in the South, Berea College promotes kinship among all people, service to communities in Appalachia and beyond, and sustainable living practices to conserve limited natural resources. Adherence to the College's scriptural foundation, "God has made of one blood all peoples of the earth," shapes the College's culture and programs so that students and staff alike can work toward both personal goals and a vision of a world shaped by Christian values. Nationally recognized for its outstanding liberal arts curriculum, Berea offers degrees in 28 fields to its 1,514 undergraduates.
