The Mission at Kern County is one of the largest Missions of its kind in the United States. The Mission was founded in 1952 by a group of men who wanted to help change the lives of homeless and hurting families in Bakersfield. During the early years, staff and volunteers offered food, clothing and ministry support to anyone who needed it. Today, The Mission continues that work, expanding its efforts to feed both the body and the soul, helping individuals and families break the cycle of poverty and achieve life success!
