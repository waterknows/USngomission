The East Bay Community Foundation is the leading resource for information about charitable giving and community needs in the East Bay region of the San Francisco Bay Area. We enhance the quality of life for the people of Alameda and Contra Costa counties through grant making, community-building initiatives, and research. We deepen philanthropy by providing an array of expert services to those who hold charitable funds with us and by focusing on advancing economic opportunity for adults and families in need and on ensuring very young children are successful in the education system so they have economic opportunity when they become adults. Last year we granted $47.67 million to nonprofit organizations. Our charitable assets under management total more than $331 million.
