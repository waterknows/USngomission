The National MS Society is united in our collective power to do something about MS now. Our vision is a world free of multiple sclerosis and we act with urgency to find solutions and change the world for people with MS. This means that each person with MS can live their best life with more connections to information, resources, and others with shared experiences; that accelerated research breakthroughs change lives and end MS forever; that everyone who wants to do something about multiple sclerosis can fuel progress; and that the voices of people affected by MS are heard and drive change wherever it is needed.
