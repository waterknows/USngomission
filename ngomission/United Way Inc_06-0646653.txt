United Way of Central and Northeastern Connecticut is a nonprofit organization that has been meeting human care needs in 40 towns across central and northeastern Connecticut since 1924.



Our mission is to engage people to improve lives and change community conditions.



United Way advances the common good by focusing on the building blocks of a good life: education, income and health. When you contribute to the annual United Way Community Campaign, you help to ensure success for children, financial stability for lower-income families, and a safety net of health and human services for everyone in central and northeastern Connecticut.
