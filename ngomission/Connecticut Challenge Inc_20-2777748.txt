The CT Challenge empowers cancer survivors to live healthier, happier and longer lives by creating and funding unique survivorship programs and research. The vision of the CT Challenge is linked to our deep history of blending sports with a passion for supporting cancer patients and survivors. By building community support through first class events such as the CT Challenge Charity bike event, our goal is to provide avenues to attract energetic people who share our mission to empower cancer survivors to live healthier, happier and longer lives.
