Since our founding in 1990, YouthBuild USA has guided the development of the national YouthBuild network of more than 226 local programs that act in collaboration to improve their outcomes and impact. The mission of YouthBuild USA is to unleash the intelligence and positive energy of low-income youth to rebuild their communities and their lives. YouthBuild USA seeks to join with others to help build a movement toward a more just society in which respect, love, responsibility, and cooperation are the dominant unifying values, and sufficient opportunities are available for all people in all communities to fulfill their own potential and contribute to the well-being of others.
