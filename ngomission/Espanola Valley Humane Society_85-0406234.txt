Founded in 1992, the Española Valley Humane Society works to improve the quality of life of companion animals in the Española Valley. We are committed to helping people find the right companion for their family. And we're here, without judgment, when surrendering a pet has become the only option. Our goal is to find every dog and cat in our care a happy and loving home. In the meantime, no one is turned away at our open doors.
