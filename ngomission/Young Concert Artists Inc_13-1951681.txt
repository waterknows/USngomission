Young Concert Artists (YCA) is a professional organization founded in 1961 to discover and launch the careers of exceptional, but unknown, young musicians from all over the world. YCA does everything possible to open the doors to the international concert world by providing management services, important debuts and performing experience at no cost to the artists. We present the Young Concert Artists Series in New York, at Zankel Hall at Carnegie with special events at Lincoln Center, and in Washington D.C. at the Kennedy Center; educate and build new audiences through our Educational Residency Program; and promote the creation and performance of new works through our Composer Program.
