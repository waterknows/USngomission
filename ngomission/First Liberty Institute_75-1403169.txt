Founded in 1972, Liberty Institute is dedicated solely to defending and restoring religious liberty in America. Our mission is to defend and restore religious liberty across America - in our schools, for our churches and throughout the public arena. Through our work in the courts, in the legislature and in the media, Liberty Institute is leading the charge to protect and restore America's first and most important freedom, our freedom of religion.
