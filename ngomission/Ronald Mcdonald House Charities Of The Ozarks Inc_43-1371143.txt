Founded in 1988, the mission of Ronald McDonald House Charities® (RMHC®) is to create, find and support programs that directly improve the health and well-being of children in the Ozarks. Our first priority is to provide a "home away from home" for families when their seriously-ill or injured child is in a hospital far from home. The Ronald McDonald Care Mobile®, fondly known as the "Tooth Truck", provides dental treatment and prevention education for at-risk children, primarily in school-based settings. As our future unfolds, our vision will continue to include strong investigation of the communities we serve, with consideration of increasing ways we can help children become healthier and stronger, and to help their lights shine brighter.
