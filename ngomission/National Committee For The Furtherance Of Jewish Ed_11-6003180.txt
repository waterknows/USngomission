The National Committee for Furtherance of Jewish Education (NCFJE) is a multi-faceted charity which protects, feeds and educates thousands throughout the New York metro area and around the nation. The NCFJE, founded in 1940, is one of the first Chabad-Lubavitch charities established in the US. The principle mission of NCFJE was to provide Jewish public school students with a free Jewish education through the Jewish Released Time program. Shortly after the founding of NCFJE, the young Rabbi Jacob J. Hecht was appointed to a leadership position and charged with expanding the organization. Today, NCFJE continues the educational and humanitarian programs spearheaded by Rabbi J. J. Hecht and pioneered with the objective of providing educational and humanitarian services to all sectors of the Jewish community.
