The mission of Jacob's Pillow Dance is to support dance creation, presentation, education, and preservation, and to engage and deepen public appreciation and support for dance. Founded by dance legend Ted Shawn in 1933, the Pillow is home to a world renowned international dance Festival that presents dance annually on three unique stages. The Pillow also supports artists as they create new work through commissions and Creative Development Residencies. The School at Jacob's Pillow encompasses a professional advancement program for dancers and choreographers as well as an Intern Program that trains young professionals in all areas of production and arts administration. Jacob's Pillow is the first and only dance entity in the United States to be declared a National Historic Landmark for the significance of its contribution to America's culture.
