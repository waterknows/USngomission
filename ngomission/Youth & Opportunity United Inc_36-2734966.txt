Y.O.U. (Youth & Opportunity United, Inc.) is a youth development agency founded in 1971 that provides services and leadership to meet the emerging needs of young people and their families in our community. It is our goal that all young people acquire the skills, self-confidence, and opportunity to participate fully, freely, and responsibly in the life of the community.
