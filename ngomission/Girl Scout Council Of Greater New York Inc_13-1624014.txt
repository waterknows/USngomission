The Girl Scouts of Greater New York, a separate 501(c)(3) organization chartered by the Girl Scouts of the USA (GSUSA), offers research-based, age-appropriate educational programs that focus on the positive development of over 29,000 girls annually in the five boroughs of New York City. The organization is guided by a powerful mission to build girls of courage, confidence, and character, who make the world a better place. The Girl Scouts of Greater New York seeks to develop in each girl a deepening self awareness, a strong value system, an ability to relate to others and a commitment to society. Girl Scouting fulfills this purpose through the organization of troop and/or group activities, the operation and maintenance of year round camping experiences, and the development of more than 8,100 adult volunteers.
