The Butler Institute of American Art works to preserve and collect works of art in all media created by citizens of our country. The Institute's holdings now exceed 20,000 individual works, and the Butler is known worldwide as America's Museum. The Beecher Center, housed in the south wing of the Butler's Youngstown location, is the first museum addition dedicated solely to new media and electronic art. The facility regularly displays works of art that utilize computers, holography, lasers and other digital media. The Beecher Center houses the Zona Auditorium, a digital media theater designed for performance art and high-definition film presentations. The Butler also operates two satellite facilities in nearby Columbiana and Trumbull Counties.
