In 1972 in order to fund dedicated and ongoing research on diabetes and related vascular diseases through private sources, St. Louis physician researchers, Drs. Charles Kilo and Joseph R. Williamson founded the Kilo Diabetes & Vascular Research Foundation. The overall research objective is to understand how diabetes affects the body and to develop medications and interventions to prevent vascular damage and diabetes-induced complications of blindness, heart attacks, strokes, nerve damage and kidney failure. This research has important implications for non-diabetics as well since we have discovered great similarities between the vascular damage caused by diabetes and damage to arteries and blood vessels that leads to heart attacks and strokes in non-diabetics.
