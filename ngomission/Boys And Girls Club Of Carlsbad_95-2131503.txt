The Boys & Girls Clubs of Carlsbad works to provide activities and experiences that enrich the lives of young people, inspiring and enabling them to reach their full potential. Boys & Girls Clubs provide a safe place to learn and grow; ongoing relationships with caring, adult professionals; character development experiences; and hope and opportunity. Boys & Girls Club programs and services promote and enhance the development of boys and girls by instilling a sense of belonging, competence, usefulness, and influence. Since opening its doors in 1952, the Club has served well over 50,000 youth, many of which still reside in the City.
