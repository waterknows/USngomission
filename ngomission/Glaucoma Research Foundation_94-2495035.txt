Since 1978, the Glaucoma Research Foundation has funded innovative research and provided educational materials about glaucoma. Glaucoma is the leading cause of preventable blindness. We work to prevent vision loss from glaucoma by investing in innovative research, education, and support with the ultimate goal of finding a cure. Our donors have contributed over $45 million dollars to this cause. While we do not conduct research ourselves, we work closely with the research community to make progress towards a cure for glaucoma.
