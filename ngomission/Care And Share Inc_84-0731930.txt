Care and Share Food Bank is a southern Colorado-based food bank affiliated with Feeding America's national network of food banks. Our mission is to "bridge the gap between hunger and abundance." Through a comprehensive food acquisition system, Care and Share acts as the sole food bank in the region for locally and nationally donated and purchased food. In fiscal year 2010-11 Care and Share distributed 11.4 million pounds of food through more than 300 human service agencies in southern Colorado. These agencies include emergency food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters for the homeless, child placement agencies, domestic violence shelters, residential treatment facilities, day care centers for both youth and the elderly and other individuals in need.
