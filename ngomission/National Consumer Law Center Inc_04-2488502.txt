The National Consumer Law Center (NCLC) is the nation's consumer law expert, helping consumers, their advocates, and public policy makers use powerful and complex consumer laws on behalf of low-income and vulnerable Americans seeking economic justice. In addition to disadvantaged consumers everywhere, we devote special attention to the problems of immigrants, vulnerable elders, homeowners, former welfare recipients, victims of domestic violence, military personnel, and others. NCLC also provides support on issues involving consumer fraud, debt collection, consumer finance, energy assistance programs, predatory lending, and sustainable home ownership programs.
