Community Storehouse acts as the first responders to any issues that threaten to interfere with a child's success in school. Our programs are strategically designed to address unmet, identified needs for the children within our community. Our services are grouped under three categories: Education, Well-being & Holiday Programs. Studies show that the education stage of children's lives is crucial to their long-term success in life and can even break the cycle of generational poverty. Knowledge is power, and we're working to help children have all the power they can through education.
