Seeking to put God's love into action, Habitat for Humanity brings people together to build homes, communities and hope. Since 1983, our affiliate has been enabling working-class families to help themselves become homeowners. To date, over 1,200 families have been able to realize their dream of home ownership. As one of seven 'Affiliates of Distinction' ranked Habitat for Humanity International, Habitat Charlotte continues to stand at the forefront of national efforts to fight substandard housing. Some of our achievements include being the first affiliate: to have existing homeowners raise the capital and construct a home for another family, to construct a home in 24 hours, and to Blitz Build 22 homes in one week. Eclipsing the three million dollar tithe level in 2012, we have become the largest single affiliate supporter of Habitat's International mission.
