Habitat for Humanity of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania is an ecumenical Christian housing ministry that seeks to eliminate poverty housing in our county. Our mission is to build simple, decent houses in partnership with people from all walks of life, regardless of race, color, sex, sexual orientation, age, religion, national or ethnic orientation or physical disability. We have been rehabilitating houses for people in need since 1989. We have completed forty-five homes in the past 20 years, sold them to families at no interest, no profit and housed more than 250 people (52 adults, 100 children) in Montgomery County. We currently build four houses per year.
