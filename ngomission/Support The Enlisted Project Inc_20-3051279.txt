Support The Enlisted Project (STEP) provides emergency financial grants and transition assistance grants to active duty and recently discharged enlisted service members and their families. Our service area now includes 19 military installations in Southern California. We serve enlisted families in pay-grades E1 to E6 whether on active duty, or honorably discharged within the past 12 months, to help them successfully reintegrate into civilian life. Whether a military family is in need of a new transmission for their car, or an expectant mother and military spouse needs critical infant items, Support The Enlisted Project (STEP) is here to help with grants, not loans, for unexpected financial hardships. Where there is a need that we do not provide, we will partner with other organizations in the community for the benefit of our Nation's heroes and the families they frequently leave behind. STEP was formerly known as Operation Homefront Southern California from 2005 to 2012.<
