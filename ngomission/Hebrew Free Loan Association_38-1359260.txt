Founded in 1895, the Hebrew Free Loan of Metropolitan Detroit provides financial help to Jewish people in the state of Michigan through the lending of money without interest. We help people in accordance with the core Jewish values of respect, compassion and confidentiality. Hebrew Free Loan's biblical directive is to lend money without interest to help Jewish people have better lives. Our goal is to match that directive with the needs of the 21st century Metropolitan Detroit (and all of Michigan) Jewish Community. Today, we help first-generation Americans pay for college, couples afford an expensive adoption or fertility process, individuals who have recently been laid off to manage their bills, and the start of new business ventures.
