Founded in 1969, the American Association of Kidney Patients (AAKP) is a national organization founded by kidney patients for kidney patients. We strive to educate and improve the health and well-being of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, those on hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and transplant recipients. AAKP is dedicated to improving the lives of fellow kidney patients and their families by helping them deal with the physical, emotional and social impact of kidney disease. The programs offered by AAKP inform and inspire patients and their families to better understand their condition, adjust more readily to their circumstances and assume more normal, productive lives in their communities.
