Meds & Food for Kids (MFK) is dedicated to saving the lives of Haiti's malnourished children and other nutritionally vulnerable people.

We accomplish our mission by developing, producing, and distributing highly nutritious foods, including the gold-standard Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF). We make our food products in Haiti, using Haitian workers and, whenever possible, Haitian raw materials. Haitians call our RUTF 'Medika Mamba' - or 'Peanut Butter Medicine' in Creole.
