The Minnesota Historical Society connects people with history to help them gain perspective on their lives. The Society preserves the evidence of the past and tells the stories of Minnesota's people. The Historical Society is chief caretaker of Minnesota's story - and the History Center is home to the Society's vast collections. Within its archives reside artifacts ranging from American Indian moccasins and artwork to furniture and photographs, Civil War-era flags and a wealth of genealogical information. All of it is accessible today and for future generations. Through its 26 historic sites and museums, the Society offers opportunities for thought-provoking entertainment, learning and fun. Visitors can discover the power of water at Mill City Museum, enjoy a breathtaking view of Lake Superior at Split Rock Lighthouse, and experience 19th-century frontier living at Historic Fort Snelling.
