Since 1997, Lifesavers, Inc. otherwise known as Lifesavers Wild Horse Rescue has provided refuge, training and adoption placement for hundreds of horses in need. We are dedicated to saving abused, abandoned, neglected, and slaughter bound mustangs and domestic horses.Our Lancaster ranch is home to our rehabilitation and rescue operation, where our dedicated staff work with our rescued horses to provide them training, socialization and handling necessary to find them adoptive homes. Our sanctuary property provides a permanent natural habitat for some of our rescued horses. Our sanctuary allows many of our horses who are unadoptable to live out their lives in an environment that is close as possible to freedom on the range.Our equine assisted therapy program called Wild Horse Warriors is for veterans with PTSD and TBI. This program is free of charge to our participants. We offer cutting edge therapy provided by the Serenity Trauma Center along with wild horse gentling.
