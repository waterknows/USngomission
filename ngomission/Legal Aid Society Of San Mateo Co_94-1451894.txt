In 1959, a dedicated group of lawyers and community leaders recognized an unmet need to help the less fortunate in San Mateo County. Thanks to these founders, in a small one-room office, the Legal Aid Society was born. Since then, the Legal Aid Society has grown to become one of California's most respected public interest law firms. A vital voice for San Mateo County's underserved populations, the organization has received awards for excellence in the delivery of legal services. Legal Aid continues to provide free, quality civil legal services to San Mateo County's low-income residents. Our advocacy has evolved with the times; we fought for civil rights in the 1960s and fair wages for farmworkers in the 1980s. Today our work encompasses nine broad areas: Caregivers, Children, Children and Adults with Disabilities, Seniors, Survivors of Domestic Violence, Teen Parents, Health, Income Maintenance, and Housing.
