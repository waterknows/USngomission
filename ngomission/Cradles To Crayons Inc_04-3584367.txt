Founded in 2002, Cradles to Crayons (C2C) is an innovative non-profit that provides children from birth through age 12, living in homeless or low-income situations, with the essential items they need to thrive - at home, at school and at play. We supply these items free of charge by engaging and connecting communities that have with communities that need.Cradles to Crayons' unique business model provides an easy and convenient avenue through which everyday essentials in good and working condition can be recycled in a socially and environmentally responsible way. Since our founding, we have distributed over 500,000 packages of goods that are hand-picked by caring volunteers to meet a child's specific needs. Currently Cradles to Crayons has locations in Boston, MA and Philadelphia, PA.
