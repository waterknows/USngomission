Founded in 1986, the Ronald McDonald House of Delaware provides a safe, affordable "home away from home" to families of seriously or chronically ill or injured children who are being treated at area hospitals and operates 3 Ronald McDonald Family Rooms within pediatric units of hospitals across Delaware. The House is a place where families can stay together and receive the kind of special care they need at such difficult times. Families find a bit of comfort and peace and a hot evening meal after a long day at the Hospital. The Ronald McDonald House of Delaware's mission is to support families in reaching the hope of tomorrow from the challenges of today.
