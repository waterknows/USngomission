The mission of the Museum of Photographic Arts (MOPA) is to inspire, educate and engage the broadest possible audience through the presentation, collection and preservation of photography, film and video. Founded in 1983, possesses an international reputation of excellence through its presentation of high quality exhibitions, lectures, publications and films. MOPA became one of the first museum facilities in the United States exclusively designed to collect and present the finest examples of photographic art, spanning the history of photography from the 19th century to the present day. The museum's permanent collection offers a rich photographic heritage, both as an expressive medium and a documentary record. The collection's 7,000-plus images include works by Margaret Bourke-White, Alfred Stieglitz and Ruth Bernhard, among 850 other photographers.
