NHS' mission is to create opportunities for people to live in affordable homes, improve their lives, and strengthen their neighborhoods. We do this by: educating and preparing new homeowners for success; lending to help people buy, fix, and keep their homes; sustaining homeownership through foreclosure prevention services; preserving, rehabbing, and investing in housing; and building powerful and enduring community partnerships.
