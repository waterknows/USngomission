Founded in 1987, Love Worth Finding (LWF) brings people to Christ and matures them in the faith. We do this by publishing and broadcasting biblical truth, maintaining a balance of compassion and conviction. We minister to hurting people, such as those who are struggling to hold their marriage and family together, people suffering from financial bondage or substance abuse, and those who are facing the attack of demonic oppression. We offer a prayer ministry through correspondence to people who are searching for answers to spiritual needs. We also reach those who are new and growing Christians with encouragement and admonition for spiritual development.
