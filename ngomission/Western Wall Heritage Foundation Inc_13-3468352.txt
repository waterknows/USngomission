In 1988, the government of Israel established the Western Wall Heritage Foundation. The Foundation's objective is to convey to all segments of the Jewish people the values inherent in the heritage of the Western Wall, to preserve and develop the Western Wall and its Tunnels, and to develop educational frameworks that make Jews everywhere feel closer to Jerusalem. The Western Wall Heritage Foundation funds its Israeli counterpart in physically maintaining and renovating the area of the Western Wall. This includes providing funding for paving and expanding the Western Wall Plaza, preserving the stones of the Wall, and preparing the Western Wall Tunnels for the close to three million visitors who have, so far, been awed by them.
