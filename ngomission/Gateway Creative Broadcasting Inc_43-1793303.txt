Desiring obedience above all, Gateway Creative Broadcasting uses Christian Music as a means of encouraging believers, uniting the body of Christ and sharing the clear, life-changing message of Jesus with the world. In 2001, JOY FM came on the air as a non-commercial, listener supported station. That means we rely fully on the generous, faithful support of our listeners and can never be sold. It also means that instead of listening to commercials, you get at least 55 minutes of music every hour.
