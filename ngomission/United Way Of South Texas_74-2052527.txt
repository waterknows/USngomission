Founded in 1979, United Way of South Texas works to improve lives by mobilizing the caring power of our community to advance the common good. We assist agencies with funding needed to provide services throughout the community, focusing on impacting community needs such as homelessness, after school programs, services for the elderly, emergency shelters, health issues, transportation, and prevention of child abuse and neglect.
