Founded in 1999, Alabama Contemporary Art Center is a non-profit contemporary arts center located on Cathedral Square in the heart of Mobile's historic downtown district. Alabama Contemporary is focused on a quest to reinvent what a contemporary arts organization can be for our time. We aim to be a pivotal force in contemporary art for the Southeast by marshaling global talent to engage all sectors of the Mobile community in ideas that matter. Alabama Contemporary investigates themes and topics of particular relevance to the Gulf Coast, functions as a public forum, convener, and cultural broker, forming strategic alliances with other cultural, social, educational and civic institutions. The goal of Alabama Contemporary Art Center is to apply creativity and innovation to the pressing needs of the day while creating a national model for constructive community building through the arts.
