The United Way of Hampshire County is about advancing the common good. It is about sustaining and strengthening a network of local agencies prepared to respond to our neighbors in need. United Way invests in opportunities that create a better life for all. We focus campaign investments in three areas that offer some of the basic building blocks for a good life - a good start for children and youth, health and safety for all and resources that promote economic security. And, as the lives of those in need improve, our entire community benefits.
