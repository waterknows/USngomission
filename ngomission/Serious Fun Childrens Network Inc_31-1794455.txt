SeriousFun Children's Network is a growing global community of independently managed and financed camps and partnership programs that have come together with a common purpose - to provide life-changing experiences to children with serious illnesses and their families around the world. Since 1988, more than 384,700 children and their families have been served, including over 253,800 children from 50 countries. Today, SeriousFun Children's Network includes 28 initiatives worldwide, all reaching beyond illness to help children and their families discover joy, confidence and a new world of possibilities. SeriousFun Children's Network and each of its member camps are independent not-for-profit organizations dependent upon private funding and the generosity of others to serve all children free of charge.
