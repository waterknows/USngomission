Sharsheret, Hebrew for "chain", is a national organization supporting young women and their families, of all Jewish backgrounds, facing breast cancer. Our mission is to offer a community of support to women diagnosed with breast cancer or at increased genetic risk, by fostering culturally-relevant individualized connections with networks of peers, health professionals, and related resources. Since Sharsheret's founding in 2001, we have responded to more than 55,000 breast cancer inquiries, involved more than 5,300 peer supporters, and presented over 250 educational programs annually nationwide.
