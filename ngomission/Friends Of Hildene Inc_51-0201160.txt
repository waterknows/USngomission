Friends of Hildene raised the money to purchase the Hildene estate in 1978 and began the long process of restoring the home and gardens. The formal gardens, designed as a birthday gift by Jesse Lincoln for her mother Mary, include many of the original plantings from 1907 and produce thousands of peony blooms each June. Hidene became home to only Lincoln descendants until 1975, longer than any other Lincoln residence. Today, Hildene's staff and volunteers welcome thousands of guests daily to the Lincoln home, grounds and walking trails.
