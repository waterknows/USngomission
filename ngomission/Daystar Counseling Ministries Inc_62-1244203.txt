Founded in 1985, Daystar offers counseling to kids and families in the Middle Tennessee area. Daystar offers both individual and group counseling for children, adolescents, families, and young adults. Counseling services are provided on a sliding scale. Daystar's model is "one-life-touching-another". It is demonstrated through one-on-one counseling sessions between a kid & a counselor, but also through group counseling, where kids learn to how to respond to each other and encourage one another.
