Return to Freedom is a wild horse sanctuary founded in 1997 by Neda DeMayo, and is the realization of her life-long dream: to protect the freedom and natural lifestyle of America's free ranging wild horses. Return to Freedom aims to accomplish its mission through sanctuary, education and conservation, while enriching the human spirit through direct experience with the natural world. Return to Freedom provides a safe haven to nearly 200 wild horses and burros Recognizing that wild horses live in tightly bonded herd groups, Return to Freedom became the first sanctuary with a focus on rescuing entire family bands. Return to Freedom's educational programs facilitate a direct experience with nature and animals through non-intrusive, sensitive observation.
