Founded in 1959, the Natural Resources Council of Maine (NRCM) is a non-profit membership organization dedicated to protecting, restoring and conserving Maine's environment, now and for future generations. We work to improve fish passage and protect the health of Maine's rivers, promote clean, renewable energy and energy efficiency, protect wildlife habitat and conserve Maine lands, and reduce waste and toxic pollution. To advance our mission, NRCM harnesses the power of science, the law, and the voices of more than 16,000 members and supporters statewide and beyond. We envision a Maine where citizens from all parts of the state and all walks of life are confident that their grandchildren will inherit a place where the water is pure, the air is clean, the forests are vibrant, and native plants and animals are thriving.
