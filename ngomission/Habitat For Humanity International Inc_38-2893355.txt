Lakeshore Habitat for Humanity is a partnership, home building & home repair Christian ministry in the greater Holland area that has served more than 150 families and 700 individuals since being founded in 1990. The organization provides low income qualified families with decent, affordable housing. The support of the local community is enlisted to assist family-partners in the construction of new and rehabilitated homes, which are then sold at cost and financed by the organization as non-interest bearing mortgages. The organization also has a retail outlet that sells new and used building materials and home improvement items that have primarily been donated.
