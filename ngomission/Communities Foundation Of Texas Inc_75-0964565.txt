Communities Foundation of Texas (CFT) has been a partner with donors for raising the quality of life in our community for 60 years. CFT provides effective ways to make meaningful charitable contributions while realizing significant tax advantages. When a donor makes a gift to CFT, a charitable deduction can be claimed. We handle the investment of the gift, listen to the donor's priorities and manage its distribution in charitable grants to worthwhile causes. The value of a gift can be granted out completely in a short period of time or it can be nurtured to provide a long legacy of charitable support. Communities Foundation of Texas is now one of the nation's largest community foundations, in terms of total assets, gifts received and grants awarded.
