Founded in 1986, The Homeless Families Foundation (HFF) educates and nurtures children while empowering families to achieve stable housing and self-sufficiency. Programs include housing assistance, holistic case management, and a children's education center (Dowd Education Center) for afterschool and summer tutoring and enrichment for children in kindergarten through middle school. HFF operates as a Housing First agency: most families, with some help, are capable of living independently and can best work to address their issues when they are in a stable, long-term home environment.
