Established in the 1950s, United Way of Long Island and its community partners work together to create lasting change in people's lives and in our communities. Our experience tells us that the best way to help people is to bring communities together to tackle primary causes of problems. Here on Long Island, United Way partners with community leaders, businesses, labor unions, government and nonprofits to advance the common good by focusing on: improving access to health care, supporting children and youth, reducing hunger, and assisting neighbors in need. We have distributed more than $250 million to support Long Islanders in need over the years.
