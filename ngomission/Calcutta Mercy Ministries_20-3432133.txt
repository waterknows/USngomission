Calcutta Mercy Ministries' mission is to be the hands, feet, and hearts that serve the poor of Calcutta. Calcutta Mercy Ministries was founded in 2005 to promote the Christian religion and raise funds to facilitate Christian and humanitarian efforts, primarily in India. With hands to give, we help deliver compassionate, end-to-end care to a compact, overcrowded city living largely below the poverty line. With feet to go, we take steps towards self-sustainable programs. We invest in hearts to grow by raising passionate leaders in the fields of education, community development, and healthcare.
