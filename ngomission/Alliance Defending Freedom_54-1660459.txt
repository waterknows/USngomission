Founded in 1994 by 35 evangelical Christian ministry leaders, the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) was conceived as an organization that would uniquely preserve and protect our first liberty - to defend the right of people of faith to hear and speak the Truth of the Gospel. Through strategy and coordination, world-class training for lawyers and law students, case and project funding, and direct litigation, our nation-shaping successes have begun to help secure and reclaim the most fundamental rights that our Constitution was designed to guarantee. Through the grace of God, legal precedents have been set and much liberty has been reclaimed. We are humbled to have been involved with our allies in 31 victories before the U.S. Supreme Court, and hundreds more in the lower courts.
