The Hooved Animal Humane Society (HAHS) was founded in 1971 by six concerned and committed citizens. It is HAHS' mission to promote the humane treatment of hooved animals through education, legislation, investigation and if necessary, legal intervention (impoundment). We provide physical rehabilitation to animals that have endured severe neglect and abuse and then adopt them out to compassionate forever homes. Our farm is located in Woodstock, Illinois on 26 acres with five barns, including a hospital facility and an Educational Center. The Center has become a place where people can learn first hand how to properly care for hooved animals. Each year we host seminars with equine professionals such as veterinarians, farriers and resistance free trainers.
