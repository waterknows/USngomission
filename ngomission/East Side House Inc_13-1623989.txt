Founded in 1891, East Side House Settlement is a community resource in the South Bronx. We believe education is the key which enables all people to create economic and civic opportunities for themselves, their families and their community. Our focus is on critical developmental periods - early childhood and adolescence - and critical junctures - points at which people are determined to become economically independent. We enrich, supplement and enhance the public school system and place college within reach of motivated students. We provide services to families in order that other family members may pursue their educational goals. We provide technology and career readiness training to enable students to improve their economic status and lead more fulfilling lives.
