The Billfish Foundation (TBF) was founded in 1986 with a mission of conserving billfish worldwide. TBF's keystone program, the traditional tagging program, was begun in 1990. Today, it has grown to be the largest international billfish tagging program in the world. TBF's initial focus was on research and educational programs. In 1990, TBF's focus was expanded to include advocacy for responsible fisheries management, recognizing that influencing decision makers with sound science was a crucial step in successful billfish conservation.
