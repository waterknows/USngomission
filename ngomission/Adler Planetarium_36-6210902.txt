The Adler Planetarium & Astronomy Museum - America's First Planetarium - was founded in 1930 by Chicago business leader Max Adler. The museum is home to two full-size planetarium theaters, including the world's first all-digital projection Definiti Space Theater, the Sky Theater which utilizes a Zeiss optical projector, and the Universe 3D Theater. It is also home to one of the world's most important antique instrument collections. The Adler is a recognized leader in science education, with a focus on inspiring young people, particularly women and minorities, to pursue careers in science.
