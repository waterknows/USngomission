Founded in 1997, HOPE International (HOPE) is a Christian faith-based non-profit organization focused on alleviating physical and spiritual poverty through microenterprise development. HOPE believes that microfinance can be a powerful force in changing the world for the better and that loving people as Christ loved others means caring for both physical and spiritual needs. HOPE practices a holistic approach to poverty alleviation. Microcredit and basic business training enable individuals to build businesses and break free from physical poverty. Clients find that their increased income enables them to provide more nutritious and regular meals as well as improved housing and education for their children.
