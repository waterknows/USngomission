Founded in 1899, The Animal Rescue League of Boston (ARL) is dedicated to rescuing domesticated animals and wildlife from suffering, cruelty, abandonment, and neglect. The ARL carries out its mission through an emergency rescue team, anti-cruelty law enforcement, adoption and veterinary services, community outreach, and burial services. We also go beyond our local area through our Center for Shelter Dogs that conducts research and training and disseminates these learnings throughout the dog sheltering field on a national level.
