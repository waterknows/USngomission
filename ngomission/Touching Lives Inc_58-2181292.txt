Touching Lives is the international broadcast ministry of Dr. James Merritt, Senior Pastor of Cross Pointe Church, in Duluth, Georgia. Nearly 20 years after its founding, Touching Lives uses a wide array of technologies to share Dr. Merritt's messages with souls in all 50 states and 140 countries around the world, touching millions of lives with the hope and encouragement of Jesus Christ. Thousands have come to Christ as a result and the number continues to grow daily. Touching Lives seeks out those who have never heard the name Jesus Christ and makes Him known. We minister to the countless who are hurting and need a touch of God's love. Touching Lives helps empower Christians in their daily walk with God to be bold in their faith. We encourage those who are weak to be strong in their stand for God and in their convictions through the Word of God.
