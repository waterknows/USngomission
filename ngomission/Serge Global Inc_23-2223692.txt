Serge (formerly World Harvest Mission) is a missions sending agency. Today, we have over 200 missionaries in 16 countries. We believe the motive and power for mission is the gospel of grace at work in the life of a believer. Our vision is to see movements of churches empowered by grace for the world's good and God's glory. We pursue this vision through holistic, incarnational ministry. Serge exists to see individuals, families, communities, and cultures so changed and renewed by the gospel of grace that they passionately pursue their role in the great story of redemption.
