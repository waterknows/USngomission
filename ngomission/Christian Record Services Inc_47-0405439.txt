Founded in 1899, Christian Record Services provides free Christian publications and programs for people with visual impairments. The goal of Christian Record Services is to reach every blind or visually impaired person in North America with our free Christian publications and services. Christian Record Services provides new opportunities for persons who are blind or visually impaired. Each year approximately 100,000 blind people's lives are changed by services we provide to them without cost. All who are blind, legally blind (20/200 with corrective lenses), or have physical impairments that prevent them from holding reading material are eligible for free services.
