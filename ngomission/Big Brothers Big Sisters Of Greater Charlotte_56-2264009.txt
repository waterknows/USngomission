Big Brothers Big Sisters of Greater Charlotte is the premier mentoring organization of the Greater Charlotte Metro area, helping thousands of children each year through professionally supported, one-on-one relationships with caring adult volunteers. In Charlotte, Big Brothers Big Sisters serves children ages five through fourteen with mentors in professionally supported one-to-one relationships. Matches come together through our three essential programs: Amachi, which provides mentors to the children of incarcerated parents; community-based mentoring, where children meet to share fun activities and stories; and site-based mentoring, during which mentors meet kids at their schools to talk and have fun.
