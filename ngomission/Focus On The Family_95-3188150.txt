Focus on the Family's mission is to cooperate with the Holy Spirit in sharing the Gospel of Jesus Christ with as many people as possible by nurturing and defending the God-ordained institution of the family and promoting biblical truths worldwide. That's been our goal since 1977, when child psychologist Dr. James Dobson started a small 15-minute radio weekly broadcast. Our broadcasts now reach 220 million listeners daily, on over 7,000 stations in 160 countries. We're on the front-lines wherever legislation threatens to harm the family. We keep the printing-presses running with brochures, newsletters, magazines and books to help make sense of marriage and parenting. We've created a web and cell phone presence for immediate advice and resources.
