Founded in 1980, the Alaska Conservation Foundation (ACF) builds strategic leadership and support for Alaskan efforts to take care of wild lands, waters, and wildlife, which sustain diverse cultures, healthy communities, and prosperous economies. ACF is at the hub of the Alaska environmental network, in touch with both local and national efforts. With a demonstrated capacity for taking a long-term view of Alaska, ACF is working to build broad-based public support for environmental protection and for institutionalizing a sound conservation ethic, through grantmaking to the most effective grassroots conservation organizations in Alaska. Since 1980, ACF has made over $40 million worth of grants to over 200 organizations working to ensure that Alaska's wild lands, waters and wildlife are protected for future generations.
