At Ronald McDonald House CharitiesÂ® of Western Washington & Alaska (RMHC), we support seriously ill children and their families. At the Seattle Ronald McDonald House, we provide a "home-away-from-home" to help families through a difficult time. We also provide a van service for families staying in Anchorage while their children receive medical care.
