The Sunshine Foundation is the original wish granting organization founded in 1976. Sunshine answers the dreams of seriously ill, physically challenged and abused children, ages 3-18 from all over the country. We have answered 32,000 dreams for children since our inception. The Sunshine Foundation's Dream Village has nine fairytale themed cottages set on 22 acres in Central Florida. This is where most of our families stay when they visit Central Florida locations. The village offers for the family a quiet and relaxing atmosphere where they can enjoy a handicapped equipped playground, wheelchair accessible pool, a miniature golf course and many other amenities to make their stay truly a dream vacation.
