Since 1877, The Fresh Air Fund has provided free summer vacations in the country to more than 1.7 million New York City children from disadvantaged communities. Each year, thousands of children visit volunteer host families in 13 states and Canada through the Friendly Town Program or attend Fresh Air Fund camps. In addition to the Friendly Town Program, each summer, 3,000 children enjoy themselves at one of the five Fresh Air camps in upstate New York. We also offer a career awareness program which focuses on expanding the education and career options of New York City adolescents.
