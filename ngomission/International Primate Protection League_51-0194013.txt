The International Primate Protection League (IPPL) was founded in 1973, and, since this time, has been working continuously for the well-being of primates. IPPL has Field Representatives in 31 countries. In countries where primates live, IPPL's Field Representatives work to create and preserve national parks and sanctuaries, and for bans on primate hunting, trapping, and local and international trade. IPPL's educational efforts have contributed to decisions by many countries to ban or restrict primate trade and to establish programs to protect primate habitat. IPPL has raised funds to help other sanctuaries working to provide a safe and enriching environment for primate victims of deforestation and poaching.
