Epworth Children's Home was established in 1895 by the South Carolina Annual Conference of the Methodist Church and chartered by an act of the South Carolina General Assembly as Epworth Orphanage. Epworth Children's Home ministers to children, youth and families through a caring, accepting and safe Christian community. Led by a professional team, the hurts of children, youth and families are healed; hope is given; and faith in God, self, and others is developed. Children ages 4-18 come to us from broken family systems and our goal is to nurture and love them by providing education, counseling, medical care and spiritual enrichment.
