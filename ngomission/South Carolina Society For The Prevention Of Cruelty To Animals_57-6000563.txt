The Greenville Humane Society (GHS) opened its doors in 1930 as the South Carolina Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SCSPCA). Over the years, we have helped unite over 250,000 people in the upstate with previously unwanted animals. As a no-kill facility, we work in partnership with our community to create an environment where all animals are treated with compassion and respect.
