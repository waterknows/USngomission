The Naval Institute Foundation was organized to operate exclusively to raise funds for the charitable and educational purposes to further the mission and policies of the United States Naval Institute. The Naval Institute Foundation is investing in the means to equip today's leaders with unlimited access to vital information when and where they need it in all corners of the world. In doing so, it utilizes donations from members and other generous donors, along with contributions from corporations and foundations, to enrich the offerings, accessibility, and preservation of a great national treasure: the Naval Institute.
