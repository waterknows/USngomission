Opera Memphis was established in 1956 as the premiere opera company in the Mid-South region. Opera Memphis' mission is to entertain, educate, and inspire the people of Memphis and the Mid-South through the art of opera. Over the last 50-plus years, we've staged nearly 200 productions of more than 75 operas, including numerous regional premieres and several world premieres. Today, we're upholding that legacy by producing operas that entertain, educate, and inspire the people of the Mid-South. We currently deliver four to six mainstage shows per season, featuring world-class singers, and accompanied by the Memphis Symphony Orchestra.
