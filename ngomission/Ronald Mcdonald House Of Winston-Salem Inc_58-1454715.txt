The Ronald McDonald House of Winston-Salem provides a "home away from home" for families of children who are receiving medical care in our community's hospitals. The House and Family Room programs offer physical comforts, emotional support, education, and referral services designed to promote the well-being of the whole family. As one of five Ronald McDonald Houses in North Carolina and one of more than 324 worldwide, we are happy to open our doors to families of pediatric patients and invite them to stay with us. Our House offers 35 bedrooms with private baths for families, four living rooms, two playrooms, a playground, and a fully stocked pantry, and kitchen with home cooked meals almost every day. Since opening in 1984, the Ronald McDonald House has been providing a "home away from home" for families.
