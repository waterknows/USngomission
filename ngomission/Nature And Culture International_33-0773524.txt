Since 1997, Nature and Culture International (NCI) has been working to protect some of the planet's most important and endangered ecosystems. We believe that the most effective way to do so is through bottom-up conservation with local communities, indigenous groups and governments. Through 16 offices in Latin America staffed by dedicated conservationists, we have helped protect more than 14 million acres to date. Now, our goal is to save 20 million acres by 2020. By giving to NCI, you can help prevent irreparable damage to our environment, the extinction of exceptional species, and the disappearance of ancient cultures.
