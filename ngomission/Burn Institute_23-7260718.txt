The Burn Institute is a nonprofit health agency dedicated to reducing the number of burn injuries and deaths in San Diego and Imperial counties. Founded in 1972, one of the Institute's first accomplishments was to help establish the UCSD Regional Burn Center. Today, the Burn Institute continues to: reach thousands of children and adults each year with lifesaving fire and burn prevention education and conduct burn survivor support programs that help children and adults cope with the devastating psychological and physical effects of their injuries.
