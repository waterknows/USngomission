Founded in 1987, NYC Outward Bound Schools is the first independent urban Outward Bound Center in the United States. Our organization traces its roots to 1941, when Outward Bound was founded by the well-known European educator Kurt Hahn. NYC Outward Bound programs are transformational. In New York City, we focus primarily on bringing our educational approach to City youth where they live, reaching them mainly through their public schools. Our educational method is called Expeditionary Learning (EL). It is used successfully in schools nationwide, and is achievement-oriented. Through EL, students reach higher levels than they ever thought possible. Academic learning connects to students' own experiences, and to real-world issues and concerns.
