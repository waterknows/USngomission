Founded in 2000 as Wai‘anae Community Re-Development Corporation, MA'O Organic Farms works to promote social entrepreneurship, growing organic food, and educating young leaders for a sustainable Hawaii. Our strategy impacts five critical areas of need: out-of-school youth, sustainable economic development, agriculture, health, and Hawaiian culture. Youth leadership and social enterprise development is our core objective, with strategies to build a localized movement to put the value of aloha ‘aina into action.
