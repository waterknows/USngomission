In 1988, God opened the door for Heart to Honduras, under the leadership of its late originator Charles Smith, to bring the village churches together in unity. Interdenominational associations were formed to advance the Kingdom of God and administer support provided by the church in North America. As a result, God is bringing new life and vitality to these materially poor followers of Jesus. Heart to Honduras is a holistic ministry that seeks to address both the spiritual and the material needs of the poor in Honduras. Our objective is to meet basic needs. In the spirit of Matthew 25:31-46, we see these needs falling into five primary categories: hope, healing, housing, food and clothing.
