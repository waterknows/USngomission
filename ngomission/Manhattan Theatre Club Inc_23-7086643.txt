Founded in 1970, Manhattan Theatre Club (MTC) is committed to bringing theatre to the widest possible audience. Initiatives which enable MTC's work to reach an ever-growing range of theatre-goers include moving successful plays originally produced at MTC's New York City Center home to larger Broadway or Off-Broadway venues for an extended run; originating certain productions in larger venues; collaborating with leading regional theatres to bring major new American plays to New York; and bringing student and family audiences to our theatres through the ambitious Education program.
