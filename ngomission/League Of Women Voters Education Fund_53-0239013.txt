Established in 1957, the League of Women Voters Education Fund (LWVEF) is a citizen education and research organization. LWVEF provides research, publications and forums on public policy issues and disseminates information and training that helps citizens be thoughtfully engaged in the democratic process. The LWVEF helps Americans perform their civic duties, including exercising their right to vote, particularly those at the greatest risk of disenfranchisement. Drawing on the League's reputation as a trusted convener, we also facilitate dialogues that enable communities to bridge political and ideological divides and find common ground on issues of greatest concern, from terrorism to global poverty.
