Founded in 1982, Second Harvest Food Bank of Greater New Orleans and Acadiana is leading the fight against hunger and building food security in South Louisiana by providing food access, advocacy, education and disaster response. Every year, Second Harvest secures millions of pounds of food that otherwise would have gone to waste. Our work helps ensure that these meals make it to the dinner tables of thousands of families struggling with hunger in South Louisiana.  In the last year, we provided 24 million meals to 210,000 individuals across 23 South Louisiana parishes.
