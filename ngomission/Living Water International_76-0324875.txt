Founded in 1990, Living Water International (LWI) exists to demonstrate the love of God by helping communities acquire desperately needed clean water, and to experience "living water" - the gospel of Jesus Christ - which alone satisfies the deepest thirst. In all of LWI's programs, we long for holistic transformation in the lives of those we serve, with a clear and well-developed focus on disciple making that infuses all of our work in water, sanitation and hygiene. We believe that God is continually at work in our world, reconciling and redeeming all things-both spiritual and physical. Our calling is to cooperate with his work by servicing some of the most impoverished communities in our world.
