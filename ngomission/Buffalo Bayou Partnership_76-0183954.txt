Created in 1986, Buffalo Bayou Partnership (BBP) is the non-profit organization dedicated to revitalizing and transforming Buffalo Bayou, Houston's most significant natural resource. BBP's geographic focus is the 10-square mile stretch of Buffalo Bayou from Shepherd Drive to the Port of Houston Turning Basin. Over the organization's 29-year history, the BBP board and staff have raised and leveraged more than $150 million in private and public funds for the redevelopment and stewardship of the bayou - spearheading capital projects such as Buffalo Bayou Park and Sabine Promenade, protecting land for future parks, constructing hike and bike trails, and operating a comprehensive clean-up program. Buffalo Bayou Partnership also seeks ways to activate Buffalo Bayou through pedestrian, boating and biking amenities; volunteer activities; permanent and temporary art installations; and wide-ranging tours and events that attract thousands.
