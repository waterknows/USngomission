In 1992 the Restless Legs Syndrome Foundation was incorporated to address the growing need for research and information about restless legs syndrome. The goals were simple and yet groundbreaking: increase awareness, improve treatments, and, through research, find a cure. Today those goals have taken on a life of their own. Our understanding of restless legs syndrome has also grown. We now know that the condition is not rare at all. In fact, recent research suggests that up to 10 percent of the general population has this neurological condition. The Foundation increases awareness of this disease by raising its profile and educating the public and medical communities alike; strives to be the most reputable source of information; and has taken giant steps to further RLS research, funding grants for 40 research projects.
