The Opportunity Network is an intensive, six-year program designed to equal the playing field for high-achieving, underserved high school and college students by creating access for them to career opportunities, professional networks and competitive colleges. The Opportunity Network believes influential networks are essential ingredients for success not emphasized in career development programs for youth, so we take an innovative approach by underscoring the power of personal connections and professional relationships as vital complements to skills and experience. Through interaction with executives, intensive networking training, coursework in careers, internships and college counseling, our students dramatically change the course of their futures.
