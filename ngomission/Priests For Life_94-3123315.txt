Founded in 1991, Priests for Life seeks to: unite, encourage, and provide ongoing training to priests and deacons who give a special emphasis to the life issues, especially abortion and euthanasia, in their ministries; instill a sense of urgency in all clergy to teach about these issues and to mobilize their people to help stop abortion and euthanasia; assist clergy and laity to work together productively for the cause of life; and provide ongoing training and motivation to the entire pro-life movement. With the co-operation of bishops and their respect life offices, Priests for Life provides a bi-monthly newsletter to priests and deacons. It is also available to the general public. We offer pro-life seminars and retreats to both clergy and laity. With the permission or their respective ordinaries, the National Director and his associates travel the country full time to meet with priests and pro-life groups.
