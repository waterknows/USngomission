Clark County Food Bank's mission is to alleviate hunger and its root causes. This two-part mission statement includes both the providing of emergency food to hungry individuals and families, and also the preventive element of doing everything we can to help people not be in a long-term place of needing food assistance. We are now well positioned to continue to make a positive difference in the lives of the hungry and food insecure in Clark County for the long term. This is possible through an active and committed board and the ongoing generosity of community philanthropists, local businesses, individuals and grants, combined with collaborative partnerships, community volunteers, public education and advocacy.
