Established in 1972, Concern America is an international development and refugee aid organization that provides long-term, community-based development and support to economically impoverished communities throughout the world. Concern America trains local populations in health, education, agriculture, and/or environmental health (appropriate technology), and accompanies these populations from eight to ten years, working with and through them to build local, functional social systems that meet their basic needs. Eventually, the Concern America team can be withdrawn, leaving in place trained local people who are capacitated to continue the work and to bring it to neighboring communities.
