Founded in 1929, the Brandywine Valley SPCA is the only open admissions shelter in both Chester and Delaware Counties. We strive to end animal suffering and to involve the entire community in the welfare and well-being of animals. We accomplish this goal by promoting the adoption of healthy animals, prevention of animal overpopulation with spay and neuter resources, and provision of affordable veterinary services as well as support to the public so that pets can remain in loving families.Our mission is to put the "human" back in humane animal treatment and advocate on their behalf. Our vision is to be the recognized leader in animal welfare that empowers communities to treat life with respect and dignity.
