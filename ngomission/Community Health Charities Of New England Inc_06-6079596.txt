Founded over forty years ago, the mission of Community Health Charities of New England is to raise funds for and increase awareness of its member charities through workplace giving campaigns. These member charities, all of which are nationally recognized health agencies, offer vital resources and services including education, treatment, outreach and research in communities throughout New England. Through our Health Matters at Work program and in partnership with our member charities, Community Health Charities of New England serves as a valuable resource for members of the business community interested in promoting mental and physical wellness among their employees.
