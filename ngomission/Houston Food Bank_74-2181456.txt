Now operating from a new, 308,000 square-foot facility, the Houston Food Bank is the nation's largest size Feeding America food bank and source of food for hunger relief charities in 18 southeast Texas counties. A network of nearly 600 food pantries, soup kitchens, senior centers and other agencies, feeding a total of 137,000 people each week, provides more than 53 million nutritious meals annually. Fresh produce, meat and nonperishables are distributed from the new warehouse at 535 Portwall, and hot meals are prepared and distributed from Keegan Center, a 15,000 square-foot industrial kitchen. Additional community services range from nutrition education to assistance with food stamp applications and hands-on job training. The Houston Food Bank, founded in 1982, is a certified member of Feeding America, the nation's food bank network. The organization plans to grow to provide 100 million nutritious meals annually by 2018.
