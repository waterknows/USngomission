The Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) Foundation's mission is to secure private philanthropic support for OHSU, and to invest and manage gifts responsibly in accordance with donors' wishes. The OHSU Foundation, with more than $595 million in assets, is the largest public university foundation in Oregon - and among the top higher education funds in America. The OHSU Foundation also administers a separate grant-making program, the Medical Research Foundation awards, supporting biomedical research in Oregon by new investigators. Since its founding more than a century ago, OHSU has become Oregon's only health and research university. Its mission is both fundamental and profound: to improve the health and well-being of the state and its citizens.
