Founded in 1988, Trailnet has a 20-year history of promoting active living - a way of life that encourages people to integrate physical activity into their daily routines. Trailnet's mission is to lead in fostering healthy and active communities through innovative programs, planning, and policy that promote walking and bicycling throughout the St. Louis bi-state region. Trailnet provides biking, hiking, walking and conservation events and community education to diverse groups of people looking to lead healthier and more active lives. Trailnet helps municipalities design streets, sidewalks and trails where people can walk and bike safely, and our Healthy and Active Communities initiative provides the first visions of healthy, active living for residents of four underserved communities.
