Leadership Resources International works to help develop biblically trained national pastors and church leaders to disciple local congregations. The simple fact is that the numerical growth of the evangelical Church around the world greatly exceeds the number of trained pastors available to lead these churches. We provide training and resources in local settings in Latin America, Russia, Africa, and restricted-access countries in Asia. We seek to stimulate pastoral growth in five significant areas of life and ministry: biblical knowledge, ministry skills, character growth, relationships, and multiplication.
