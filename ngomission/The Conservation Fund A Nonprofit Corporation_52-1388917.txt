At The Conservation Fund, we believe that conservation should work for America. By creating solutions that make environmental and economic sense, we are re-defining conservation to demonstrate its essential role in our future prosperity. We have the highest program allocation - putting 97% of our resources toward mission - and lowest fundraising costs in our field and continue to outperform for our efficiency and effectiveness. Since 1985 we have protected more than 7.5 million acres of land, working in all 50 states; we've preserved forests, deserts, parks, waterways and every type of landscape in between. From historic places that tell the story of America to helping communities grow smarter, greener cities, our work benefits all Americans.
