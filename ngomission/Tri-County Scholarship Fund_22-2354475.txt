The Mission of Tri-County Scholarship Fund is to raise money to provide financial support to deserving and economically disadvantaged children in Morris, Passaic and Sussex counties of New Jersey, regardless of race, religion, or national origin, so they can obtain a quality, values-centered education through accredited K-12 private elementary and secondary schools. Scholarships are awarded annually to hundreds of students. Many families are immigrants struggling to provide their children with a quality education in a safe and disciplined environment. Since 1981, over 30,000 scholarships have been awarded representing over $22 million in Tri-County Scholarship Fund assistance.
