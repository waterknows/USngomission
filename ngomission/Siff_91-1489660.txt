SIFF's mission is to create experiences that bring people together to discover extraordinary films from around the world. It is through the art of cinema that we foster a community that is more informed, aware, and alive. Founded in 1976, SIFF is Seattle's leading year-round film organization that brings the best in international and independent film to the Seattle area with the Seattle International Film Festival (now in its 39th year), SIFF Cinema and Futurewave Education. At SIFF, we pride ourselves in offering audiences the opportunity to discover original stories, explore diverse cultures, and take new emotional journeys.
