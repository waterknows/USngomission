The City Rescue Mission of Saginaw is a faith-based organization that provides emergency assistance to people of Mid-Michigan in their time of need. The alcoholic, drug abuser, unwed mother, domestic violence victim, and homeless can find a safe haven for a fresh start at the City Rescue Mission. Our purpose is to glorify God by serving people in need, proclaiming the Gospel, and establishing disciples among disadvantaged people. We accomplish this by providing immediate needs of lodging, meals, and clothing 365 days a year to whoever may inquire. We continue the process by offering programs that provide Christ-centered teaching, preaching, counseling, work therapy, and computer skills training.
