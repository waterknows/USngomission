The mission of The Glaucoma Foundation (TGF) is to fund groundbreaking research and to educate the public about the disease and the importance of early detection to prevent blindness. Founded in1984 by Dr. Robert Ritch, TGF is one of the premier organizations dedicated to eradicating blindness from glaucoma through vital research and education. The Foundation works to encourage and support basic and applied research in glaucoma, to gain and disseminate new information about the causes and treatment of glaucoma, and to further efforts to identify and develop novel approaches to preserve visual function and reverse blindness caused by glaucoma. Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases which in most cases produce increased pressure within the eye. Over time, it causes damage to the optic nerve.
