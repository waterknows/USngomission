In 1984, the Food Bank for Larimer County was founded to avoid duplication of food collection and distribution efforts by nonprofit agencies. Our mission is to reduce hunger through programs that collect, process, store and distribute food to individuals and in cooperation with agencies that serve those in need. We are the only Feeding America clearinghouse for donated and rescued food in Larimer County. In 2007, we reduced hunger by distributing 5.6 million pounds of donated and surplus food from the food industry, government commodities, food drives and other sources to disadvantaged Larimer County residents. These residents represent single-parent families, the working poor, senior citizens, youth in crisis, the disabled and the homeless.
