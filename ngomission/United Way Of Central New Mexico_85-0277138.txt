United Way of Central New Mexico is involved in creating lasting change in our community. We partner with people from all across the community to make the greatest difference. We're focusing on building financially stable families, preparing children to succeed, and creating a cohesive community. We do this by: supporting services that promote a safe and nurturing environment for children and families; improving access to physical and mental health care as key components in a productive community; helping those challenged by birth and life events with support, resources and information to meet their immediate and long-term needs which will enable them to increase their independence and improve their quality of life; and empowering both adult and child victims of violence by providing a multi-disciplinary, accessible, culturally appropriate service delivery system.
