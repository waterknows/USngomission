Founded in 1998, the US-Ireland Alliance is a proactive, non-partisan organization dedicated to consolidating existing relations between the United States and Ireland -- North and South -- and building that relationship for the future. The US-Ireland Alliance includes members from both the United States and Ireland, representing groups and individuals with a strong interest in Irish affairs. It educates the American public about the relationship and is creating a network so that the constituency will have an informed voice in Washington. The US-Ireland Alliance ensures that its membership, the public, officials, educators and the business community on both sides of the Atlantic are kept fully informed and educated on issues of mutual interest.
