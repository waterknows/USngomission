Dayton Ohio Habitat for Humanity works in partnership with God and people from all walks of life to develop communities with people in need by building and renovating houses so that there are decent and affordable homes in safe communities where families can live and grow. Habitat for Humanity serves as a hand up, not a handout, for families in need. Families apply to us to earn a house of their own. Once accepted into the program, our "Partner Families" work alongside our many volunteers to build their house. They put in 275 to 550 hours of "sweat equity" before earning their home, which is then sold to them on an affordable, interest-free mortgage. Partner families make a down payment toward the purchase of their home.
