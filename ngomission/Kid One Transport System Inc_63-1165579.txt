Kid One Transport was founded in 1997 by a young firefighter from Hoover, AL: Russell Jackson. For Kid One, the mission is simple: transport children and expectant mothers to necessary health care services. Kid One has been fulfilling this mission as the only 501 (c) (3) nonprofit of its kind in the state of Alabama and one of only a handful of nonprofit transportation providers targeting children in the U.S. We are an organization committed to removing transportation as a barrier to quality health care throughout the state of Alabama. From our drivers to our fundraisers, we work daily to ensure that the most vulnerable and needy among us are not abandoned due to their circumstances.
