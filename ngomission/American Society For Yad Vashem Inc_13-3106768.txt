Founded in 1981 by a group of Holocaust survivors, and spearheaded by Eli Zborowski, the American Society for Yad Vashem works in partnership with Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority in Jerusalem to support their efforts in the areas of commemoration, education, research, capital improvement and special projects. Yad Vashem was established in 1953 by the Israeli Parliament (Knesset) and was entrusted with the task of commemorating the six million murdered by the Nazis and their collaborators. It mandates Holocaust remembrance, commemoration, and education to ensure the lessons of the Holocaust are secured for posterity.
