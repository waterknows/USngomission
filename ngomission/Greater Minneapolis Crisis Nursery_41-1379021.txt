Greater Minneapolis Crisis Nursery works to end child abuse and neglect and create strong, healthy families. The Crisis Nursery supports families in crisis 24 hours a day, 365 days a year through our free, voluntary services. We started with a goal to establish a crisis helpline 24 hours a day, seven days a week; and to shelter six children per day. Today we answer over 4,500 crisis calls and shelter over 2,300 children a year. We've come a long way and remain committed to ending child abuse and neglect and to supporting and strengthening families in our community.
