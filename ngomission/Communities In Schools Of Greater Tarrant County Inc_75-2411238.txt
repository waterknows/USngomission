Communities In Schools (CIS) in Tarrant County is part of a national network of CIS programs serving over 1.3 million students. CIS was founded in 1992 in Forth Worth as a result of a United Way Stay-In-School task force. The mission of CIS is to surround students with a community of support, empowering them to stay in school and achieve in life. CIS serves Tarrant County students who are identified by their schools as most at-risk of someday dropping out, due to a variety of barriers they face. CIS social workers are placed directly inside local schools on a full-time basis to provide intensive case management services, to meet a wide range of needs. They serve not only students, but their families. Most students meet federal poverty guidelines and most come from homes where no one has graduated from high school. CIS has a 98% success rate at keeping at-risk students in school on the path toward graduation.
