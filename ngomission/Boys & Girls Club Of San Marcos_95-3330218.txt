Our mission at the Boys & Girls Clubs of San Marcos is to inspire and enable all young people to realize their full potential as responsible and caring citizens. The Club opened its doors to youth in 1979 and today is a vibrant youth development organization that serves over 2,800 youth. We offer hope, opportunity and a safe affordable place for youth to go before and after school. Club programs and services promote and enhance the development of boys and girls by instilling a sense of competence, usefulness, belonging and influence. The Boys & Girls Club is a safe place to learn and grow -- all while having fun. It is truly the positive place for kids.
