With roots dating back to 1985, Hands Together is devoted to educating, inspiring and encouraging people to understand and respond to the needs of people, especially the poor and disadvantaged. Hands Together carries out its mission through programs designed to bring dignity to the poor--primarily in Haiti. By establishing schools, orphanages, nutrition and feeding programs, medical clinics, sustainable-development projects, and by establishing partnerships with local leaders and communities, Hands Together is building a better world for thousands of suffering people in Haiti. Hands Together volunteers bring needed skills to many of our educational, health and sustainable-development projects.
