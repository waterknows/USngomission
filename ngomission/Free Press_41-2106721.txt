Free Press fights for everyone's rights to connect and communicate.We're working to create a world where people have the information and opportunities they need to tell their own stories, hold leaders accountable, and participate in policymaking. We fight to save the free and open Internet, curb runaway media consolidation, protect press freedom, and ensure diverse voices are represented in our media.Today, Free Press is the nation's largest organization advocating for media and technology policy in the public interest, with 900,0000 members and a staff of 25 based in our offices in Washington, D.C., and Florence, Mass. We believe that change happens when people have a real voice in the political process. To that end, we mobilize our growing base of activists to sign petitions, meet with their elected officials, attend rallies and town-hall meetings, write letters to the editor, and take part in other targeted actions. We also craft policy proposals, conduct research, testify before Congress and argue in court for policies that serve the public interest.
