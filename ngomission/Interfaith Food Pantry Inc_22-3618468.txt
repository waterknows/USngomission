Established in 1994, the Interfaith Food Pantry was formed when a group from local houses of worship decided to address the growing issue of hunger by consolidating their food assistance programs. The Interfaith Food Pantry is a non-denominational, non-profit organization helping eligible families in Morris County make ends meet by supplementing their monthly groceries in times of need. The Pantry is currently distributing more than 1.7 tons of food a day serving more than 10,500 people a year.
