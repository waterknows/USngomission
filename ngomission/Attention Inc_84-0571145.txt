Attention Homes provides opportunities for at-risk youth to change their lives. We offer shelter, community-based living and teaching of life skills necessary for an independent future. Our goal is to help youth in crisis become healthy, productive members of our community. Attention Homes has two programs for at-risk youth: Runaway & Homeless Youth (RHY) and Adolescent Residential Care (RES). Our RHY program provides street outreach, day drop-in and overnight emergency shelter services to homeless youth under the age of 20. Our RES program operates three tracts: respite/extended care, sober living and transitional living.
