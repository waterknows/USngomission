Founded in 1958, the Polly Hill Arboretum, a 70-acre public garden, contains the results of Polly Hill's fifty years of horticultural experimentation. Rare trees and shrubs from around the world are set among stone walls, meadows, and fields, including Polly's famous North Tisbury azaleas, the national stewartia collection, camellias, clematis, crabapples, magnolias, and many more. Our mission is to perpetuate the experimental tradition in horticulture established by Polly Hill by sharing knowledge of plants and scientific procedure through educational programs, research, plant conservation, and exploration. The Arboretum seeks to preserve its meadows and woodlands, to promote an understanding of its collections, and to encourage their utilization for scholarship, observation, and the enjoyment of all.
