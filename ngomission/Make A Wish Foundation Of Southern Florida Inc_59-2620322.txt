The mission of the Make-A-Wish Foundation of Southern Florida is to grant the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions to enrich the human experience with hope, strength, and joy. There are 65 Make-A-Wish chapters covering the United States and 28 affiliates of Make-A-Wish Foundation International. The Southern Florida chapter was founded in 1983. The Southern Florida chapter serves children in 13 counties: Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach, Martin, St. Lucie, Indian River, Okeechobee, Highlands, Monroe, Hendry, Glades, Collier and Lee. This past year, we granted the wishes of 508 children and have granted more than 9,000 wishes in our history.
