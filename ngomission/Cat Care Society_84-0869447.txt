Cat Care Society (CCS) was founded in 1981 to improve the quality of life for homeless, injured and abused cats in the Denver metropolitan area. The Society's goals are: to sponsor educational programs that promote responsible pet ownership, humane treatment of all animals, and the elimination of pet overpopulation; to shelter cats in a healthy, cage free environment and to find compatible and responsible families for every cat; to provide community outreach programs that improve the quality of life for cats and people; and to be a friend to all cats. The shelter provides a temporary refuge for up to 45 adult cats until an appropriate and permanent home can be found for each. Veterinary care, premium diet and human interaction are lovingly provided.
