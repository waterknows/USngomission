One of the oldest affiliates in the nation, Habitat for Humanity of Collier County has been building homes and serving families in this community since 1978. Building at a pace of 100 homes a year since 2002, Habitat Collier has now provided simple, decent homes for more than 1,800 families. Through its unique business model, Habitat for Humanity of Collier County uses 100% of donor dollars to fund the construction of homes, which are then sold to qualifying partner families. Each family helps to build and then purchase their home with an interest-free loan, thereby returning the original investment in their lives. This "hand-up" allows families to become a part of their own housing solution.
