The Willamette Humane Society (WHS) was founded in 1965 by local civic leaders and serves Marion and Polk counties. Dedicated to promoting the welfare of animals through leadership, education and action, WHS exists to: provide a temporary shelter for discarded, abused, abandoned, and lost animals as an open-admission shelter; complete families by matching companion animals with people; and lead the community through education by teaching respect and compassion for animals.
