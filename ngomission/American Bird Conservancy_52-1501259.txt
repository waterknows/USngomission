American Bird Conservancy's (ABC) mission is to conserve wild birds and their habitats throughout the Americas. Founded in 1994, it is the only U.S.-based group exclusively devoted to bird conservation throughout the Americas. ABC acts across the full spectrum of threats to birds to safeguard the rarest bird species, restore habitats, and reduce threats, while unifying and strengthening the bird conservation movement. ABC advances bird conservation through direct action and by finding and engaging the people and groups needed to succeed, regardless of their political, economic, or social point of view. ABC seeks innovative, fair solutions to difficult issues.
