Our mission at Make-A-Wish® Missouri is to grant the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions to enrich the human experience with hope, strength, and joy. The Missouri chapter of the Make-A-Wish® Foundation serves all 115 counties in Missouri and 6 Kansas counties that are a part of metro Kansas City (Franklin, Johnson, Leavenworth, Linn, Miami, and Wyandotte). The first wish in our area was granted in 1983, and since then more than 4,000 wishes have been granted throughout our Chapter.
