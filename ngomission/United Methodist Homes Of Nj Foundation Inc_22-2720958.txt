The United Methodist Homes of New Jersey Foundation, a non-profit 501(c)(3), acts as the fundraising and public relations arm of the United Methodist Homes. With a staff of eight, it conducts direct mail campaigns, capital campaigns, donor identification and cultivation, special events, and gift planning. This raises support for the Fellowship Fund, which sustains residents who have exhausted or limited financial resources. The Foundation fosters specialized programs for churches and community groups, and relationships between United Methodist and other denominations that uphold services to senior men and women. In the public relations arena, it communicates current developments through its websites, publications and through media outlets.
