At Camp Nejeda children with diabetes are free to be just children. This normalizing of their condition combines with both formal and informal educational moments to promote good diabetes management and healthy, active living. The addition of our Family Camps and other Extended Programs offered throughout the year provides the empowering fellowship and educational opportunities for individuals with type 1 diabetes of all ages and for their families.
