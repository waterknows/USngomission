At Fayetteville Urban Ministry our focus is transforming lives through FAITH, HOPE, LOVE, and SECURITY. The Find-A-Friend youth program strives to spark FAITH in youth for a brighter tomorrow. The Adult Literacy Program establishes HOPE for a better future through the gift of reading, education, and job preparation. The Emergency Assistance program seeks to LOVE our neighbors by meeting their basic needs for food, clothing, and crisis support. Finally, The Nehemiah Project builds SECURITY in our community by providing free home repairs to low-income homeowners.
