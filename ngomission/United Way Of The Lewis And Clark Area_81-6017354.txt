United Way of the Lewis and Clark Area (UWLCA) is a locally run non-profit organization that focuses on health and human service needs by funding 33 non-profit agencies in Lewis and Clark, Jefferson and Broadwater counties. They also coordinate the services that those agencies provide to prevent overlap and to make sure people can get all the help they need. From teen moms at the Florence Crittenton Home to retirees volunteering through the Rocky Mountain Development Council, UWLCA agencies serve people of all ages. Each year, more than 55 community volunteers come together to review UWLCA's partner agencies to ensure that your donation is going to an organization that's accountable and trustworthy.
