Established in 1976, the National Museum of American Jewish History (NMAJH) is the only museum in the nation dedicated exclusively to collecting, preserving and interpreting artifacts pertaining to the American Jewish experience. The NMAJH's mission is to present educational programs and experiences that preserve, explore and celebrate the history of Jews in America. Our purpose is to connect Jews more closely to their heritage and to inspire in people of all backgrounds a greater appreciation for the diversity of the American Jewish experience and the freedoms to which Americans aspire. NMAJH has a collection of more than 20,000 artifacts which resonate with the history of more than 350 years of American Jewish life; more than 40,000 individuals visit NMAJH each year.
