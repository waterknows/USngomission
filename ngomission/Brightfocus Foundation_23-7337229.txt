BrightFocus drives innovative research worldwide and promotes awareness of Alzheimer's, macular degeneration, and glaucoma. BrightFocus' goal is to eradicate brain and eye diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, macular degeneration, and glaucoma. We are working to save mind and sight.BrightFocus is at the forefront of brain and eye health, advancing early-stage, investigator-initiated research around the world. We also provide free educational materials to people affected by or interested in these diseases, empowering them to take action for themselves and others.  A nonprofit organization under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of the United States, we were founded in 1973 and known until 2013 as the American Health Assistance Foundation. We chose our new name-BrightFocus Foundation-to reflect our vision of a world where everyone experiences life fully and with clarity.
