Inner-City Scholarship Fund (Inner-City), a not-for-profit organization, was founded in 1971 by the late Terence Cardinal Cooke and a group of prominent New York executives from many religious backgrounds. Inner-City seeks to provide tuition assistance to students from low-income families who wish to attend inner-city Catholic schools within the Archdiocese of New York, thus making values-based Catholic education a viable choice for children of all faiths. Through the generosity of its volunteers, Inner-City is also able to supplement the education received with a variety of enrichment programs to benefit these children and the schools they attend.
