The World Monuments Fund (WMF) is the leading private organization dedicated to saving the world's most treasured places. For over 40 years, working in more than 90 countries, our highly skilled experts have applied proven and effective techniques to preserve important architectural and cultural heritage sites around the globe. Through partnerships with local communities, funders, and governments, we inspire an enduring commitment to stewardship for future generations. Headquartered in New York, WMF has offices and affiliates worldwide. 

Nearly 90% of the revenue raised by the World Monuments Fund goes directly toward preservation projects, fieldwork, advocacy, and educational programs. Every two years, WMF issues the World Monuments Watch list of 100 Most Endangered Sites, a global call to action on behalf of sites in need of immediate intervention.
