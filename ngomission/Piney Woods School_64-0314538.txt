The Piney Woods School was established in 1909, in a desperately poor section of Mississippi in rural Rankin County. The Piney Woods School recognizes that throughout the United States there are students, especially African-American students, who have the capability to make their lives extraordinary through excellence in education and development of moral and ethical attitudes, but do not have the opportunity to do so for financial or other reasons. Piney Woods' mission is to provide that excellence in education within a Christian community through creation of an exceptional academic model which supports the tenet that all students can learn, develop a strong work ethic, and lead extraordinary lives through academic achievement and responsible citizenship.
