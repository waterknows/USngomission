Founded in 1926, Cheyenne Mountain Zoo has been a place where memories are made and people of all ages and all walks of life come together to explore the animal kingdom. Cheyenne Mountain Zoo is open every day of the year and is home to more than 750 animals representing approximately 142 species, 30 of which are endangered. A leader in conservation, captive breeding and animal care, Cheyenne Mountain Zoo connects people with wildlife and wild places through experiences that inspire action. Our vision is that every kid, of any age, will have an experience for a lifetime with every visit.
