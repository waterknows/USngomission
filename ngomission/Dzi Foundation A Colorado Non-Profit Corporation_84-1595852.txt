The dZi Foundation is a Ridgway, CO-based non-profit founded in 1998 by longtime mountaineers Jim Nowak and Kim Reynolds. We work in partnership with remote communities in Nepal to create lasting improvements in their quality of life. We accomplish this through implementing community-driven programs that improve public facilities, public health, income levels and educational opportunities while preserving community unity, the natural environment, and indigenous culture. In 2001, dZi established itself as a Colorado-based 501Â©(3). Since that time, the organization has grown significantly and has honed its focus on community-led development projects in some of the most remote communities in Nepal. dZi currently serves people in an expanding network of remote villages, focusing primarily on basic infrastructure like school buildings, toilets, drinking water systems and bridges as well as agriculture initiatives.
