Founded in 1961, Project Concern International's (PCI) mission is to prevent disease, improve community health, and promote sustainable development. Motivated by our concern for the world's most vulnerable children, families, and communities, PCI envisions a world where abundant resources are shared, communities are able to provide for the health and well being of their members, and children and families can achieve lives of hope, good health, and self-sufficiency. PCI works in disadvantaged and isolated communities to bring health and hope to those in greatest need by preventing disease, responding in emergency relief situations, and providing access to clean water, nutritious food, and economic opportunity. PCI reaches 6.7 million people annually with programs in Africa, Asia, and the Americas.
