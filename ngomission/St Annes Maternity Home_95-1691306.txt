Founded in 1908, and officially sponsored in 1941 by the Franciscan Sisters of the Sacred Heart, St. Anne's first opened its doors as a maternity hospital for pregnant, unwed, young mothers. At that time St. Anne's was regarded as a hiding place for young women to come in secrecy and to conceal their pregnancies from the community and their families. Today St. Anne's remains committed to providing targeted programs and support services in response to the ever-changing needs of today's society, never straying from our mission of helping disenfranchised young women, children and families in need, without regard to race or religion.
