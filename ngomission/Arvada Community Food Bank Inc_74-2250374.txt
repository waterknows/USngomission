The Arvada Community Food Bank (ACFB) formed in 1982 in Colorado to serve the needy and vulnerable in our community. Our goal is to secure the resources (food, financial, physical, and volunteers) necessary to provide programs to help meet the nutritional needs of qualifying community members. The Arvada Community Food Bank has worked with city government, churches, schools, civic organizations, businesses and private citizens to ensure that the residents of Arvada and surrounding communities would have a place to go for emergency food. ACFB volunteer force has grown to nearly 300 people providing approximately 20,000 hours of service. Annual community food donations have grown to exceed 500,000 lbs.
