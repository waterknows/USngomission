For more than 150 years, the YMCA of Greater Rochester has provided innovative, quality programs that strengthen families, aid in the healthy development of children, encourage positive individual behavior and contribute to a healthier, safer community for all. Through a variety of programs, including child care, camping, sports, swimming lessons, teen leadership development, senior programs, family activities, health and wellness classes, and more, we build character by emphasizing the core values of caring, honesty, respect, responsibility, fun and friendship.
