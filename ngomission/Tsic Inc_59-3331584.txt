Take Stock in Children (TSIC) was established in 1995 to provide a unique opportunity for low-income and at-risk students, many from minority families, to escape the cycle of poverty through education. We offer our students college scholarships, caring volunteer mentors and hope for a better life. Our comprehensive services start in middle school, continue through high school and include their transition into college. We fund our college scholarships and student services through a unique public-private fund raising model, and our mentors generously volunteer their mentoring services to our children. TSIC's multi-year commitment to at-risk children throughout our state is also an investment in the communities in which our students live. Since our inception we have served more than 28,000 children throughout Florida. Over 96% of our students graduate from high school and 96% go on to pursue a post-secondary education, well over the national average.
