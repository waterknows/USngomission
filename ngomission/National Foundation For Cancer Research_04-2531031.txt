The National Foundation for Cancer Research (NFCR) was founded in 1973 to support cancer research and public education relating to the prevention, early diagnosis, better treatments and ultimately, a cure for cancer. NFCR promotes and facilitates collaboration among scientists to accelerate the pace of discovery from bench to bedside. For nearly four decades, NFCR has been committed to discovery-oriented scientific research - Research for a Cure - cures for all types of cancers. We believe that in order to fully conquer this devastating disease, we must encourage innovative scientists to study cancer at its most fundamental level. Our funding of nearly 50 laboratories worldwide has led to some of the most significant breakthroughs in cancer research, including new approaches such as targeted cancer therapies.
