One Million Degrees empowers low-income, highly motivated community college students to succeed in school, in work, and in life. Formerly the Illinois Education Foundation, One Million Degrees was founded in 2006 by a group of social entrepreneurs who understood the specific challenges facing a uniquely overlooked student population - community college students. One Million Degrees believes that when given a solid system of support, every student has the ability to reach his or her full personal and professional potential.
