SafePlace is ending sexual and domestic violence through safety, healing, prevention and social change. We do this through our emergency shelter, 24-hour hotline, hospital accompaniment programs and legal services. We also provide extensive counseling services for children, teens and adults as well as providing transitional housing, advocacy and life skills training to give people the resources and skills to stay safe. Our disability services, school-based services and community education work are all focused on preventing violence and promoting safe and healthy relationships. Working with others, we promote alternatives to the attitudes, behaviors and policies that perpetuate the acceptance of interpersonal violence, especially violence against women.
