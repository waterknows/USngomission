The WAND Education Fund creates educational materials for training and briefing individuals, elected leaders and the media. Founded in 1982, we have been dedicating our energies to redirect federal budget priorities away from the military and toward human needs. Our goals are to: challenge and promote alternatives to militarism and violence as the solution to conflict; shift from a military to a civilian-based economy to address the threats to our real security; clean up environmental effects of nuclear weapons production as well as toxic waste at all military facilities; eliminate the testing, production, sale and use of weapons of mass destruction; prevent violence against women; and increase women's political leadership to further WAND's goals.
