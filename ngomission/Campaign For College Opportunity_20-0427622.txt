The Campaign for College Opportunity is focused on a single mission: to ensure that the next generation of California students has the chance to attend college and succeed in order to keep our workforce and economy strong. The Campaign's work is guided by three main priorities: to engage a broad coalition of California leaders and organizations in support of higher education access and success; to raise public awareness and share research highlighting the challenges and opportunities facing California; and to support policy solutions and reforms to our higher education system so that we can produce the one million additional college graduates our state needs.
