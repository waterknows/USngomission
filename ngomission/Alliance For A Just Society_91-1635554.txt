The Alliance for a Just Society's mission is to execute regional and national campaigns and build strong state affiliate organizations and partnerships that address economic, racial, and social inequities. This is the core idea of the Alliance: to give grassroots organizations, research groups, media organizations and educators the ability to work together, each doing what we have the experience and expertise to do best. Our vision for the Alliance is a multifaceted national organization that includes grassroots and progressive organizations with particular expertise working together to address economic, racial, and social inequality.
