Established in 1914, the Potter Children's Home & Family Ministries works to be a tool in the hands of supporting churches of Christ and individual Christians to deliver God's justice and mercy to children and families in need. Our Residential Group Care program is at the core of our ministries. This program is for children ages 6-18 years old who are in need of a loving, stable, structured home environment. Our Single Parent Alliance for Raising Kids (SPARK) program allows families to stay together during their recovery from a divorce, desertion or death. The Transitional Living ministry is designed to serve young people ages 18-23 who have little or no support from their families. We also offer foster care and Christian counseling.
