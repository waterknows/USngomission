Since its founding in 1963, Trinity Repertory Company has been one of the most respected regional theaters in the country. Featuring the last permanent resident acting company in America, Trinity Rep presents a balance of world premiere, contemporary, and classic works for an estimated annual audience of approximately 135,000. In its 45-year history, the theater has produced 57 world premieres, mounted national and international tours, and, through its MFA program, trained hundreds of new actors and directors. This season marks the 43rd year of Project Discovery, Trinity Rep's pioneering educational outreach program. Last season, the program introduced 25,000 Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Connecticut students to live theater. The Brown University/Trinity Rep Consortium offers professional training for actors and directors in a three-year MFA program. Since 1973, Trinity Rep's home has been the Lederer Theater Center, a historic landmark built as the Majestic Theatre in 1917.
