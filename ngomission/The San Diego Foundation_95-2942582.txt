The San Diego Foundation is San Diego's leading resource for information about charitable giving and community needs. We encourage and support meaningful dialogue on issues affecting each of our communities and work with philanthropists to develop creative solutions to meet critical community needs. Since our inception in 1975, The San Diego Foundation has helped public-spirited citizens find ways to address community problems. The funds we manage now number more than 1,050. Through them, our donors support numerous organizations and serve a variety of community needs. Our donors and funds all share a common purpose: to make San Diego a better place in which to live, work and play.
