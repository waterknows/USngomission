Operation Access is committed to helping low-income, uninsured people receive the surgical and specialty care they need but cannot afford. We are also committed to providing meaningful local volunteer opportunities for medical professionals, and dedicated to restoring our patients' ability to earn a living, to care for their families, and to enjoy healthy lives. Operation Access brings healing and hope to people in need, and demonstrates that the impulse for doing good works is alive and well in the Bay Area medical community.
