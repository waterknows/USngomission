The Sacramento Zoo inspires appreciation, respect and a connection with wildlife and nature through education, recreation and conservation. The nonprofit 501(c)(3) Sacramento Zoological Society, formed in 1957, assumed financial and daily management of the Zoo (from the City of Sacramento) in July 1997. Since its inception, the society has served as the fund-raising organization for the Zoo, providing funds for animal care, education and conservation programs. We design our nationally recognized education programs for children and adults of all ages. Society-sponsored school programs reach an average of 60,000 to 80,000 students per year-both at the Zoo and off-site at area schools and community venues. More than 10,500 local and regional households are members of the Sacramento Zoological Society.
