Founded in 2003, the National Inclusion Project (NIP) serves to bridge the gap that exists between young people with special needs and the world around them. The National Inclusion Project is committed to leading efforts that create opportunities for inclusive camping/recreational/social experiences for children across the country. To date we have partnered with more than 100 community-based organizations impacting about 15,000 children annually. The organization serves as an enabler, consultant, trainer, and partner to ensure implementation of best-in-class inclusive practices. Together with community leaders we ensure no child sits on the sidelines!
