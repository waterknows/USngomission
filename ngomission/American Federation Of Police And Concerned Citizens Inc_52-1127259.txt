Founded in 1960, the American Federation of Police and Concerned Citizens (AFP&CC) assists family members and children of officers killed in the line of duty through programs of compassion, scholarship and gifts, and assists in the process of adjustment after the loss of a loved one. AFP&CC also promotes the training of police reserves; encourages a free exchange of information between men and women presently engaged in law enforcement and reserves; encourages citizens interested in volunteer law enforcement to involve themselves in their communities; aids in the national civil defense program in the event of any natural disaster or in time of war for the protection of life and property; and educates the public about the contribution made to society throughout history by law enforcement personnel.
