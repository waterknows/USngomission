The Daughters of Charity (a Roman Catholic Sisterhood) and Catholic Social Services founded Friendship Home in 1978 as a short-term shelter for women. Friendship Home exists to support, shelter and advocate for women and children who are victims of domestic violence. We provide safe, confidential shelter emergency and transitional shelter to rebuild lives free from fear. We also provide an array of crisis intervention services, case management and emotional support to women and children in shelter and those who are waiting for shelter.
