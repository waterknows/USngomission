The George Bush Presidential Library Foundation (GBPLF) was established in 1991 as an educational foundation to design, build, and support the George Bush Presidential Library and Museum at Texas A&M University. In addition to sponsoring its own programs and activities, the Foundation provides program and financial support to the Library, as well as the George Bush School of Government and Public Service. The Foundation sponsors a number of programs including a yearly domestic and foreign policy conference, the White House Lecture and Exhibit Series, and various other lecture and program series. Through its activities, the Foundation is helping make the George Bush Presidential Library Center a leading center in cultural, policy, and academic discussions.
