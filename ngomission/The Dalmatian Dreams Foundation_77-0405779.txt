Dream Foundation is the only national dream-granting organization for adults and their families suffering life-threatening illness. Dream recipients are 18 years of age and older, with a prognosis of 12 months or less, and who lack the resources to fulfill their dreams themselves. Since its inception in 1994, Dream Foundation has served more than 20,000 final dreams and never turned away a qualified dream request. Dream Foundation presently serves more than 2,500 dreams each year.
