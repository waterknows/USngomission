Since its inception in 1879, the Wisconsin Humane Society (WHS) has become one of the most established and well-recognized non-profit organizations in the community. WHS' mission is to build a community where people value animals and treat them with respect and kindness. For more than 130 years, WHS has been providing quality, cost effective services for homeless animals. It is the largest humane society in Wisconsin and one of the largest in the United States. Among the many programs and services WHS provides to the community are a comprehensive adoption program, lifesaving medical care for nearly 20,000 animals annually, a spay/neuter clinic, educational programs for children and adults, and one of the largest wildlife rehabilitation hospitals in the nation. WHS has two locations: a Milwaukee shelter at 45th & Wisconsin, and our new Ozaukee Campus in Saukville.
