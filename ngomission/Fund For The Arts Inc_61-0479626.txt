The Fund for the Arts' mission is to increase revenues for the arts and to enable our community to become the preeminent regional arts center in the United States and to maximize the impact of the arts on overall economic development, education of our children and the enjoyment of living in our community. We accomplish our mission through the enhancements and preservation of resources by providing excellent service. The Fund for the Arts is the oldest united arts fund in the country and has raised over $157 million since its establishment in 1949. The 2009 campaign raised over $8.8 million, a long way from its first campaign in 1949, of $99,000.
