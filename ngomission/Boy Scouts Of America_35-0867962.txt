The Boy Scouts of America prepares young people to make ethical choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Law. The Crossroads of America Council aims to beneficially involve every eligible child and their family in the fun and adventure of our programs. We will provide extraordinary youth development programs that: strengthen values, develop leadership skills, provide lifelong learning, and instill the habit of service to others.
