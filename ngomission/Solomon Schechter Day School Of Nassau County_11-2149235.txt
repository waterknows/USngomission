The Solomon Schechter Day School of Nassau County and the Solomon Schechter High School of Long Island's rich heritage is the result of the dream of a few special people. In the days when Nassau County lacked an educational center for Conservative Judaism, a dedicated group of families had a vision, took a chance and started a day school in 1967 at Temple Beth Sholom in Roslyn. The need for a Conservative High School in Nassau County united families, Rabbis and administrators from day schools on Long Island as well as Queens. In 1994, the Solomon Schechter High School was born and housed in our middle school building in Hicksville. Combined, the schools currently enroll 555 students in kindergarten through twelfth grades.
