Children of Bellevue (CoB) is a non-profit organization founded in 1949 to initiate, fund, and develop programs that improve the health and well-being of children at Bellevue Hospital Center. We are advocates for pediatric patients and their families, and are dedicated to alleviating the pain, loneliness, and fear that can accompany childhood hospitalization. We also seek to enhance early development and school-readiness in children at risk of falling behind due to family poverty.
