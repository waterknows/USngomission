United Way of the Greater Capital Region brings people and resources together to advance the common good. We partner with local nonprofits, businesses, government and human service agencies to address the region's most pressing issues in the areas of basic needs, education, income and health. These are the building blocks everyone needs for a good life and they are the cornerstones of a strong community. United Way expresses its mission through fundraising and grant making to a network of nearly 100 carefully-selected human service programs, and by aligning partners around a common mission to tackle issues such as poverty and hunger that are beyond the capacity of an individual or single agency to solve alone.
