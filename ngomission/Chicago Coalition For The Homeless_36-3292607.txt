Community organizers, public policy specialists and legal aid attorneys advocate for and with people hurt by homelessness - including mothers with children, unaccompanied youth, low-wage workers and ex-offenders. Together, the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless (CCH) advocates for a shelter safety net, affordable housing, jobs with fair wages, and access to quality public schools. A new campaign, HomeWorks, advocates with Chicago housing providers for more family housing and organizes homeless families to push for better school services. Regular outreach at 30 shelter and street programs reaches 7,000 youths and adults a year. A Statewide Network organizes in nine communities, focused on Aurora, Rockford and Waukegan. The Speakers Bureau reaches 4,500 people a year and organizes students to advocate with CCH. The Law Project and its mobile legal aid clinic, Youth Futures, close more than 400 cases a year, 93% on behalf of homeless students or youth with civil legal needs.
