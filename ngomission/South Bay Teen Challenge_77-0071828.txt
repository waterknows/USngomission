The purpose of Teen Challenge is to help people who have life-controlling problems and initiate the discipleship process to the point where the student can function as a Christian in society. The Teen Challenge approach is to teach a whole new way of living by addressing family relationships, work attitudes, self-image and esteem, peer pressure, addictions, social issues, community relationships, and a variety of other life skills. Teen Challenge endeavors to help people become mentally sound, emotionally balanced, socially adjusted, physically well, and spiritually alive.
