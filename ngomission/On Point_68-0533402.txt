On Point partners with schools and communities to cultivate the strengths in youth and guide them on their path to thrive. On Point works by providing young people with the knowledge and on-going support they need to avoid risky behaviors and equips them with the skills they need to thrive. Each year, On Point reaches approximately 12,000 adolescents in Chattanooga, North Georgia and Cleveland through our holistic and multifaceted Life On Point and Think On Point programs. Since On Point's inception, the teenage pregnancy rate has decreased by 54% (per 1000 teenage girls). In addition to impacting our community, On Point's curriculum is used in over 40 states and 13 countries.
