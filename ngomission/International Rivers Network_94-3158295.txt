Founded in 1985, International Rivers (also known as International Rivers Network) protects rivers and defends the rights of communities that depend on them. We oppose destructive dams and the development model they advance, and encourage better ways of meeting people's needs for water, energy and protection from damaging floods. We work with a global network of dam-affected people, environmentalists, human rights advocates and experts who are committed to fighting destructive river projects and promoting better alternatives. Focusing our work is in Latin America, Asia and Africa, we foster grassroots organizations in more than 60 countries and promote the leadership of our regional partners by providing technical and strategic advice.
