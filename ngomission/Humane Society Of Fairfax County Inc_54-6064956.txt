Established in 1968, the Humane Society of Fairfax County (HSFC) was formed by concerned citizens to rescue and protect both domestic and wild animals from abuse, neglect, abandonment, and cruelty. The organization has changed tremendously over the years. A handful of volunteers has grown to over a hundred dedicated individuals who give their time to help whenever and wherever needed. Our list of services to the community includes educating the public about animal care, alerting the community about the horrors of the fur industry and hunting, providing information on state and county laws, foster parenting animals awaiting adoption, adopting a multitude of different animals into loving homes, and helping to rehabilitate wild animals for future release.
