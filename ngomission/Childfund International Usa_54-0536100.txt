Founded in 1938, ChildFund International (formerly Christian Children's Fund) is inspired and driven by the potential that is inherent in all children; the potential not only to survive but to thrive, to become leaders who bring positive change for those around them. Our area of excellence and great strength is our deep understanding of children's experiences of deprivation, exclusion and vulnerability, and our dedication to placing those experiences at the center of our policy and practice. We work to reduce the roots of poverty by: giving a voice to deprived, excluded and vulnerable children and youth and implementing child development, protection and emergency assistance programs through local communities.
