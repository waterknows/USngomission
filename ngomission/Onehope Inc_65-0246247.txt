Founded in 1987 by missionary Bob Hoskins, OneHope is reaching the world's children and youth with the message of the Bible in a way that addresses specific cultural challenges. In collaboration with churches and ministries - and working with local governments, schools and non-governmental organizations - OneHope has reached some 600 million young people in 125 countries with the message of the Bible through its Book of Hope publications and The GodMan animated film. By conducting local research on children and faith in specific regions of the world, OneHope continues to innovate its ministry model and offers its expertise and resources to other child-focused organizations.
