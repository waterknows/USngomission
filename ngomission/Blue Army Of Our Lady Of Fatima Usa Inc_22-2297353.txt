The Blue Army of Our Lady of Fatima is a worldwide public association of the faithful, responding to the requests that Our Blessed Mother made to three shepherd children in Fatima, Portugal in 1917, to help save souls and bring peace to the world. It promotes Eucharistic prayer and the Rosary, as well as penance, especially the generous acceptance of the duties of our state in life. The Blue Army has become an international apostolate, the World Apostolate of Fatima, with millions of members and national centers in many countries around the world. In the United States, the Blue Army developed a beautiful National Center and Shrine to the Immaculate Heart of Mary in Washington, New Jersey. It also built a beautiful pilgrim center, Domus Pacis (House of Peace) in Fatima, to welcome English-speaking pilgrims.
