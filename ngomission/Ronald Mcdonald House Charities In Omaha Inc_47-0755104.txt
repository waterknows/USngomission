Ronald McDonald House Charities of Omaha helps families. The organization provides for families that bring their sick children to our community for medical care, provides dental care to kids who might otherwise go without and supports organizations that focus on improving children's lives. The Omaha Ronald McDonald House keeps families together during a most difficult time. We provide a temporary home for families that bring their sick children to our community for medical care in one of our hospitals or institutions. We have served more than 1,100 families from 43 states and six countries during the past 12 years. Approximately 40 percent of those families are from Nebraska, another 20 percent are from Iowa. The Ronald McDonald House Charities in Omaha is part of a global organization with chapters in 50 countries. Together, they form the official charities of McDonald's restaurants.
