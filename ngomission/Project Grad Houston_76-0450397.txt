Project GRAD Houston (Graduation Really Achieves Dreams) is an education reform model with a goal of creating the most cost effective and research-based methods for addressing the needs of students and families in low-income communities so that students graduate from high school, then access and succeed in college. The GRAD Scholarship Program provides financial assistance toward a college education to eligible seniors in Houston, Texas. To aid the delivery of College Access and College Success services, GRAD is leveraging expanded partnerships and collaborations to respond to the growing demand for efficient services. These partnerships include community-based organizations and institutions of higher education, as well as public, charter and private schools.
