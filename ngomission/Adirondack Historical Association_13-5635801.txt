The Adirondack Museum believes in the power of history to ignite the imagination, stimulate thought and shape the future. Our collections and engaging programs reflect stories of life, work, and play in the Adirondack Park and northern New York State. The museum expands public understanding of Adirondack history and the relationship between people and the Adirondack wilderness, fostering informed choices for the future. Opened to the public in 1957, the museum includes a research library, publications program, and an active education department that offers special events, classes, symposia, workshops, demonstrations, field trips, and engaging hands-on experiences for thousands of visitors each year.
