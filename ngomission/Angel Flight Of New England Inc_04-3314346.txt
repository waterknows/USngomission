Founded in 1996, Angel Flight Northeast coordinates free flights so children and adults can access medical care for as long and as often as needed. We are a volunteer corps of over 1,000 private pilots and Earth Angels who combine our love of flying with the spirit of grassroots volunteerism by flying patients and their families to the critical health care they need. We provide free air transportation in private aircrafts by volunteer pilots so that children and adults may access life-saving medical care free of charge. We are also a vital mode of transportation for organs, blood and for patients awaiting organ transplants. Since our founding, we have answered over 65,000 flight requests and have flown more than 13 million miles.
