Nestled in a quiet, rural Georgia community about an hour northeast of Atlanta, Eagle Ranch is a Christian-based children's home for up to 66 boys and girls between the ages of 8 and 18. The Ranch is a multi-faceted center - a home, a school and a counseling center - where children live for a season of their lives while their families learn to put their lives back together again. Our children come from a variety of backgrounds and home situations, and each has unique needs and issues. All are in some stage of crisis, and most are behind in school. Our team of houseparents, counselors and teachers collaborates to help the boys and girls address these issues. During the entire process, we also work with the children's families toward restoration. As our children and their families identify and change negative behaviors, they are able to overcome past failures and embrace a hopeful future.
