SHARE supports, educates, and empowers people affected by breast or ovarian cancer. We help people face their feelings and fears, communicate effectively with their doctors, and make informed decisions about their health. All of SHARE's services are free of charge, confidential, and provided by survivors. SHARE's services include telephone support, educational programs, support groups, and public-health initiatives.
