The mission of the King Street Center is to promote personal and social wellness through educational, recreational, and social programs. King Street Center serves over 500 children and families each year. Programs include an accredited preschool for 3-5 year-olds; an afterschool program for children in grades K through 5; Teen Futures, our innovative program for middle and high school students; an evening drop-in program for teens; several mentoring programs for children of all ages; and much more. In partnership with Vermont Adult Learning, we also provide English Language instruction several mornings a week for the many new arrivals to the community.
