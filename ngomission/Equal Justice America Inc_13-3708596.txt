Established in 1993, Equal Justice America (EJA) has become a national leader in providing opportunities for law students to work with organizations that deliver civil legal services to those most in need. Our efforts expose a new generation of future lawyers to the urgency for pro bono assistance to our most vulnerable citizens. Students at more than 60 law schools now have the opportunity to take part in the Equal Justice America Fellowship Program. Equal Justice America has sponsored fellowships for more than 2,000 law students to work with over 250 legal services organizations. EJA has paid out nearly $6.2 million in grants and has provided approximately 625,000 hours of free legal services.
