At Soliya, our mission is to empower young adults to establish more cooperative and compassionate relations between their societies by combining the power of dialogue with the reach of new media technologies. We believe that best-practices in dialogue from the field of conflict resolution present models that can and should be applied through these new tools to ensure interactions are constructive and promote deeper understanding and empathy. In doing that, we focus our efforts on young adults, particularly those who are in higher education or active in civil society, because we believe that they are not only the leaders of tomorrow but also the change-makers of today. Youth have consistently been the driving force behind major social change movements, and that is only more true in this era of new media technologies, which they are always the first to master.
