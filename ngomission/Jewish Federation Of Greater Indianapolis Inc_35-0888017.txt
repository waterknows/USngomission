The Jewish Federation of Greater Indianapolis is the central philanthropic, planning and community relations organization of the Jewish community. The Federation and its agencies, in cooperation with the synagogues, function to promote the general welfare of the Jewish community and to ensure the creative survival and continuity of the Jewish people. The Federation community mission is grounded in a pluralistic understanding of the historical, moral and cultural values of Judaism. The Federation is the connection to the entire Jewish community - in Indianapolis, in Israel and around the world.
