Founded in 1854, the YMCA of Greater Indianapolis is a community service organization dedicated to putting Christian principles into practice through programs that enhance personal growth and improve the health of spirit, mind and body for all. At the root of our mission is a commitment to character development and the four core values of caring, honesty, respect and responsibility. Throughout Indianapolis, our twelve YMCA branches serve more than 171,000 people from diverse communities- providing over $6 million in scholarships, program subsidies, and underwritten programs in low-income communities.
