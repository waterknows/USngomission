Founded in 1927, Brookwood Florida is a licensed therapeutic group home for adolescent girls ages 13 to 21, who come to us from throughout the state of Florida. Residents are victims of abuse, neglect, violence, family dysfunction, or homelessness. Brookwood Florida is dedicated to providing troubled adolescent girls with an alternative living environment and therapeutic program encompassing education, employability skills, independent living training and counseling that will prepare them for self-sufficiency or successful family reunification. Brookwood's treatment philosophy is a combination of cognitive, behavioral and reality therapies. The program goal is to assist troubled young women in developing skills, self-concepts and a maturity level sufficient to successfully return home or move into independent living.
