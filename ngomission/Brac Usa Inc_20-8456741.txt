BRAC is a development success story, spreading solutions born in Bangladesh to 10 other countries around the world - a global leader in creating opportunity for the world's poor. What started out as a limited relief operation in 1972 in a remote village of Bangladesh has turned into the largest development organization in the world. Organizing the poor using communities' own human and material resources, it catalyses lasting change, creating an ecosystem in which the poor have the chance to seize control of their own lives. We do this with a holistic development approach geared toward inclusion, using tools like microfinance, education, healthcare, legal services, community empowerment and more. Our work now touches the lives of an estimated 126 million people in 11 countries. BRAC USA is a US affiliate created in 2007 to advance and support BRAC's global mission.
