Founded in 2002, the American Border Patrol (ABP) is the only non-governmental organization that monitors the border on a regular basis. They do so mostly by air. The ABP has three aircraft, each designed for a specialized mission. They operate from a ranch on the Mexican border in Southeastern Arizona in the heart of a major smuggling corridor. ABP also educates the public about border control issues and solutions via the Internet and other media outlets. ABP is a watchdog. They watch what the government is doing and report directly.
