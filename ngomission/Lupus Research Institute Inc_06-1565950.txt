The Lupus Research Institute (LRI) is the nation's only nonprofit organization solely dedicated to novel research in lupus. We believe that innovative research is the key to finding safer and more effective treatments and a cure for lupus. Established in 2000, we now have the largest number and widest range of lupus research investigations nationwide - LRI scientists are at 53 academic medical centers across 22 states. We've awarded $26 million to 96 novel ideas in lupus. Breakthroughs have been made in understanding: the genetics of lupus; why and how certain organs get attacked in lupus; basic mistakes in the autoimmune response; and biomarkers of lupus development and flare.
