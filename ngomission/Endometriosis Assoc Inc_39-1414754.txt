Founded in 1980, the Endometriosis Association was the first organization in the world created for those with endometriosis. Endometriosis is a painful, chronic disease that occurs when endometrium tissue is found outside the uterus. This misplaced tissue develops into growths or lesions. The Endometriosis Association is an independent self-help organization of women with endometriosis, doctors, and others interested in the disease; it is a recognized authority in its field whose goal is to work toward finding a cure for the disease as well as providing education, support, and research. The Association has a network of chapters, groups, sponsors, and women with endometriosis in 66 countries throughout the world. Information is available in 28 different languages.
