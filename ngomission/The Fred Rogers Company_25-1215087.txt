Family Communications was founded by Fred Rogers in 1971 as the non-profit producer of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood for PBS. In the years that followed, the company not only created hundreds of episodes of this much-loved program, but also extended Fred's values and approach to other efforts in promoting children's social, emotional, and behavioral health and supporting parents, caregivers, teachers and other professionals in their work with children. Now, we honor Fred by carrying on his work under our new name - The Fred Rogers Company. We're proud to be building on Fred's legacy in innovative ways through a wide variety of media, and engaging new generations of children and families with his timeless wisdom.
