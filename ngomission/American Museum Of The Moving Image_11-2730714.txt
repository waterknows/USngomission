Museum of the Moving Image advances the public understanding and appreciation of the art, history, technique, and technology of film, television, and digital media. It does so by collecting, preserving, and providing access to moving-image related artifacts; screening significant films and other moving-image works; presenting exhibitions of artifacts, artworks, and interactive experiences; and offering educational and interpretive programs to students, teachers, and the general public. Museum of the Moving Image has begun a major expansion and renovation of its existing Astoria home. This major undertaking includes a new three-story addition and the complete renovation of the Museum's first floor. When it is completed in 2010, the new Museum building will be ideal for showcasing the moving image in all its forms.
