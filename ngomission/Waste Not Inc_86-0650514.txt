Waste Not occupies a very unique niche in our community. We are not a food bank, yet we feed thousands upon thousands of hungry people every day. Our trucks and drivers are on the road six days per week, beginning at 6:30am, collecting an average of 6,000 pounds of excess perishable food daily from restaurants, resorts, caterers, grocers and various food purveyors - food that would otherwise be thrown away. We deliver the food the same day to more than 100 diverse agencies that feed the hungry including schools, after-school programs, daycare centers, rehabilitation centers, transition homes and senior facilities.
