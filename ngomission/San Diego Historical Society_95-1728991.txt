San Diego History Center (SDHC) was founded by George W. Marston in 1928, then as the San Diego Historical Society (SDHS). Today, the San Diego History Center is dedicated to helping people of all ages learn about, and enjoy, the history of San Diego, and to appreciate how our past, present, and future are interrelated. SDHC's core programs and services include: exhibitions; educational programs; the operation of a research library; and scholarly publications. Permanent and changing exhibitions interpret the history of San Diego from the period prior to European settlement to the present.
