Middle Way House envisions a community where individuals live free from violence and the threat of violence; a community characterized by equality across the gender spectrum and social and economic justice; a community where everyone's contribution is honored and individual and group differences are valued; a community where everyone is adequately fed, housed, educated and employed; a community that provides opportunities for meaningful participation, personal growth, and creative expression. Our purpose includes meeting the specific housing, employment, and service needs of abused women and their children, as well as offering a comprehensive range of services responsive to individual needs and differences. We raise awareness of violence against women, provide information about the cycle of violence and available remedies, and encourage sensitive and appropriate responses to victims of violence.
