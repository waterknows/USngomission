The Colorado Symphony embraces a tradition of musical excellence by presenting a wide variety of symphonic performances - from classical repertoire to innovative new forms - in Boettcher Concert Hall. Established in 1989 as the successor to the Denver Symphony, the CSO is the region's only full-time orchestra. Each season, approximately 200,000 adults and youth attend CSO concerts, including a 16-week Masterworks series of classical programs, as well as Pops, Family, Holiday and Summer concerts.
