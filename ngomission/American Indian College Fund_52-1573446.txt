The American Indian College Fund provides scholarships and other support for the American Indian students. Tribal colleges, the vast majority of which are located on or near reservations, provide opportunity and access to post-secondary education where once there was none. Offering accredited degrees while keeping Indian culture and tradition at the heart of their curricula, tribal colleges are changing the face of Indian education, one graduate at a time. The Fund disburses approximately 6,000 scholarships annually for American Indian students seeking to better their lives through continued education. The number of tribal colleges has grown to more than 30, located in 13 states and serving more than 250 American Indian Nations from every geographic region in the United States.
