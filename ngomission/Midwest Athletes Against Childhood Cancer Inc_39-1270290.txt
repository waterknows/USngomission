Midwest Athletes Against Childhood Cancer (MACC Fund) was formed in 1976 to support research into the effective treatment and cure of childhood cancer and blood disorders. Cancer is the leading disease-related cause of death in children after the newborn period. The MACC Fund has contributed $33 million for pediatric cancer research. This research impacts children throughout the country since the successful protocols become the standard for patient care everywhere. The MACC Fund believes it will one day be cured right out of existence and shares this optimistic, hopeful vision with all the dedicated researchers, doctors, nurses, parents, children and friends who support its work.
