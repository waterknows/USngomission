Worldfund's vision is for every child in Latin America to benefit from exceptional educators who inspire them to learn the skills necessary for dignified work and life. Worldfund delivers world-class, practical, human-centered training and ongoing support to teachers and principals from underserved schools in Latin America. Worldfund works in partnership with state governments and private corporations to achieve scale and sustainability of its three programs - STEM (science and math teachers), LISTO (principal leadership training) and IAPE (public school English language teachers). Since its founding in 2002, Worldfund has trained more than 2,000 teachers and principals in Latin America's public schools. We impact over 350,000 students annually and aim to reach 1.2 million by 2015. Worldfund has offices in New York City, Mexico City, and SÃ£o Paulo.
