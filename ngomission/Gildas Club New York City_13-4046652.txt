Gilda's Club New York City's (GCNYC) mission is to support, educate and empower cancer patients and their families to help them learn to live with a cancer diagnosis-no matter what the outcome. Our comprehensive program for cancer support includes support and networking groups, educational lectures and workshops, and social activities. We also provide Noogieland and Camp Sparkle programs for children (4-12 years old) and a Teens Connect support group for teenagers (13-17 years old). GCNYC was named for Gilda Radner, the brilliant comedian and one of the original cast members of Saturday Night Live. She learned to live with cancer with help from a support community she joined in California, where she felt she could express what she was really feeling. It was her dream that anyone touched by cancer would be able to receive the kind of emotional and social support that she had found.
