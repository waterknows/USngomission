The Exchange Club Family Center works to break the cycle of family violence and child abuse so that children do not grow up to become child abusers. At the Family Center, children can find a safe haven to be nurtured, and parents can learn new behaviors that enable them to take better care of their children. At The Exchange Club Family Center there is help that restores the hopes and dreams of children and adults affected by child abuse, family violence, or traumatic family transitions. The Center offers programs to help both children and adults understand these behaviors and gain the support they need to cope with difficult family situations. Each of these programs improves life skills, helping children and adults learn to modify behaviors, improve self-esteem and deal with anger.
