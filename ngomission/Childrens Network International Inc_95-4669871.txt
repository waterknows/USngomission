Help the Children is a Christian humanitarian relief organization dedicated to help alleviate the suffering of children and their families throughout the United States and around the world. Help the Children's mission is to increase self sufficiency by providing food, clothing, personal care items and medical supplies without regard to political affiliation, religious belief, or ethnic identity. Internationally, Help the Children is committed to serving people with diverse cultural and economic conditions beyond their control. We strive to meet their emotional, spiritual and physical needs with Christ based principles with love and compassion.
