Founded in 1995, Family Scholar House is changing lives, families and communities through education.

Our mission is to end the cycle of poverty and transform our community by empowering families and youth to succeed in education and achieve life-long self-sufficiency. Family Scholar House assists participants in obtaining needed support services and helps them address barriers to education. All participants meet regularly with their Support Manager for service. While the majority of families served by Family Scholar House are in the non-residential programs, those in need of stable housing may apply for the residential program.
