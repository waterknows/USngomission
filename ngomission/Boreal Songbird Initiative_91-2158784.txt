The Boreal Songbird Initiative (BSI) is dedicated to outreach and education about the importance of the boreal forest region to North America's birds, other wildlife, and the global environment. Why is a United States organization working to protect the Canadian boreal forest? Because it is one of the largest intact forest ecosystems left on earth and it is critical to North American birds. International attention is a key part of conserving the Canadian boreal because of the volume of trade between the U.S. and Canada.
