Ferst Foundation for Childhood Literacy makes a difference in the lives of children through the gift of literacy, with the mission to "provide books for local communities to prepare all Georgia preschool children for reading and learning success." The Foundation addresses the growing problem of children from low-income families entering school unprepared to learn with a simple recipe for early literacy development. Ensure that children have age-appropriate books in the home and provide parents with supportive material that reinforces the importance of early learning and encourages them to read frequently with their children. By mailing a new book every month to enrolled children, birth to five, the Foundation is committed to providing early learning opportunities with the hope of breaking the cycle of poverty and illiteracy. Our vision is to afford the best chance to every child to succeed in school, and in life, and to give Georgia an educated, productive and competitive work force.
