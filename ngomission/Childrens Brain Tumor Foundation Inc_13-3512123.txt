Children's Brain Tumor Foundation was founded in 1988 by dedicated parents, physicians and friends. Our mission is to improve the treatment, quality of life and the long term outlook for children with brain and spinal cord tumors through research, support, education, and advocacy to families and survivors. Knowledge is critical for families to access expert care and ensure quality of life. Our free publication 'A Resource Guide for Parents of Children with Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors' is now in its fourth edition, and is full of practical information to sort out the complexities of medical procedures, interruptions in school and social life, and uncertainty about the future. We also offer a toll-free support line, parent to parent network, and we host and sponsor events which offer families fun while building relationships within the community.
