Founded in 1910, the Stevens-Swan Humane Society (SSHS) of Oneida County provides a safe haven to all domestic pets that must be surrendered, are stray, abandoned, homeless, abused, or injured. The SSHS serves as a safe haven for nearly 5,000 animals each year that need to be sheltered, regardless of circumstance. Taking care of these animals 365 days a year is a tremendous responsibility. At SSHS our mission is to protect the health and safety of both the animals and local communities of Oneida County, New York. We make sure that the animals are as comfortable as possible, and that they receive the medical attention they need. We also serve as a source for information for all kinds of animal related problems, questions and help.
