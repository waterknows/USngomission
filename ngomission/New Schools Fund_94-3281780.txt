Founded in 1998, the NewSchools Venture Fund works to transform public education so that all children - especially those underserved - have the opportunity to succeed in the 21st century. As a nonprofit venture philanthropy firm, we raise capital from both individual and institutional investors; we then use those funds to support promising education entrepreneurs, help them grow their organizations to scale, and connect their work with public school systems - particularly within targeted urban areas. We believe that education entrepreneurs can spark this broader transformation in the public school system.
