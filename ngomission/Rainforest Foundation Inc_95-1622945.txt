The Rainforest Foundation helps protect the incredibly rich biological diversity of the rainforest and the cultural integrity of the peoples whose lives and livelihoods are inextricably linked to those forests. By working with indigenous communities to gain control of their ancestral lands we have helped protect 28 million acres of rainforest. We provide project-related grants and technical support to indigenous groups to secure rights to their lands, influence laws and policies to protect their resources and livelihoods, and build strong and sustainable community leadership.
