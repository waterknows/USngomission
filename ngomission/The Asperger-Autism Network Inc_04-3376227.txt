The Asperger/Autism Network (AANE) works with individuals, families, and professionals to help people with Asperger Syndrome and similar autism spectrum profiles build meaningful, connected lives. We do this by providing information, education, community, support, and advocacy, all in an atmosphere of validation and respect. While our primary mission is to assist individuals affected by AS, AANE is an inclusive organization that also serves people who have other neurological differences or who feel our services would be helpful. Individuals do not need to have a professional diagnosis of Asperger Syndrome in order to benefit from AANE's services. In addition to the services we provide from our home base, AANE works in close partnership with other Asperger's and Autism organizations throughout New England, as well as disability organizations that offer services relevant to the autism population.
