The Persecution Project Foundation (PPF) was founded in 1997 for the purpose of mobilizing Christians to engage in active compassion for the persecuted. We bring crisis relief and spiritual hope to victims of civil war, genocide and religious persecution. We also provide on the ground assistance while restoring hope and rebuilding communities through the love of Christ.
