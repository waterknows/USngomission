College Golf Fellowship (CGF) works to share the Good News of Jesus Christ with college golfers and coaches and equip them to be fully devoted followers of Christ. Starting with that our outreach event held over 30 years ago, CGF has since grown and expanded into a national ministry with full-time staff members ministering in seven different regions across the country.
