Positive Coaching Alliance (PCA) is a national non-profit organization founded within Stanford University's Athletic Department in 1998 with the mission to transform the culture of youth sports so every youth athlete has a positive, character-building experience.



During the last 12 years, PCA has impacted more than 4 million youth through partnerships with more than 1,700 youth sports organizations, leagues, schools and cities nationwide. PCA has presented over 9,000 workshops, training more than 430,000 coaches, parents, organization leaders and athletes.



PCA's Double-Goal Coach® curriculum helps coaches adapt the model that the first goal is winning and the second, more important goal is teaching life lessons through sports. PCA material for Second-Goal Parents™ trains parents to focus on children's life lessons and not the scoreboard. PCA's Triple-Impact Competitor™ program develops youth who are committed to improving themselves, their teammates and their sport as a whole.
