Authentic. Innovative. Proud. ArtsMemphis supports arts organizations, funds arts education and outreach efforts, and leads a community-wide Audience Development Initiative to promote engagement in the arts. In 2013 we celebrate our 50th anniversary as the premier funder, advocate and promoter of the arts. In FY12, we distributed $4 million, including more than 100 grants to 60 local arts and culture groups in 10 categories. We have granted more than $40 million over the past 10 years, and more than 95% of every dollar raised in the annual campaign is reinvested in the arts community.
