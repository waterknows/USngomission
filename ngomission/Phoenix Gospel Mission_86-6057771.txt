The Phoenix Rescue Mission was founded in 1952 by six businessmen from the Phoenix area. In the beginning, they ministered to migrant workers and vagrants. Homelessness was not yet a term that was associated with persons who had unfortunate circumstances. The Mission has expanded its services to offer three meals daily, a 24-hour walk in center, showers and clean clothing, up to 150 emergency shelter beds nightly, a 21-bed Residential Addiction Recovery Program, a Career Education Center, Chapel services, and referral information. Hope Coach is a van sent out daily providing lunches, bottled drinks, Christian literature, blankets and a friendly word of encouragement to the homeless on the streets.
