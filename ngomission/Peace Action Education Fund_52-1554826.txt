Peace Action Education Fund works to achieve the abolition of nuclear weapons, promotes government spending priorities that support human needs, and encourages a foreign policy that embodies respect for human rights. The Fund is the sister organization of Peace Action, the nation's largest grassroots peace group with chapters and affiliates in 30 states. For 50 years Peace Action has worked for an environment where all are free from violence and war. We understand that long standing global conflicts require long-term solutions, and that US foreign policy has a lasting effect on the world. PAEF's national office provides national campaign coordination, training of local activists and volunteers, public mobilization and hosting annual strategy meetings for lead organizers.
