Founded in 1989, Extra Mile Education Foundation supports the education of urban children in select Pittsburgh parochial elementary schools. The schools - identified by the Diocese of Pittsburgh - are in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods, and the students are primarily African American and non-Catholic. Extra Mile is dedicated to sustaining these schools for their communities on an ongoing basis as a needed supplement to the financial commitments of the Diocese of Pittsburgh, the schools, and the parents and families of the children. Extra Mile's schools currently serve over 800 children from pre-kindergarten through eighth grade.
