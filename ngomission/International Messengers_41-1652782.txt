Established in 1984, International Messengers is an evangelical interdenominational missions organization comprised of an international staff team. We are committed to making disciples of all nations through partnering with local churches to renew, train and mobilize believers for active involvement in reaching the world for Christ. We believe that the spiritual revival of the Church is a primary key to effectively reaching this world with the love of Christ. We are committed to serving the local church, helping her move towards renewal, and then to again envision her central role in spreading the Gospel locally and globally. We see ourselves as partners with the local church to equip and send people into the world with the truth of Jesus Christ.
