Jubilee Housing is a faith based organization founded in 1973 to provide affordable housing and supportive services to economically disadvantaged residents of the Adams Morgan neighborhood of Washington, DC. Today in the Nation's Capital, as in so many other areas of the United States, there is a growing dearth of safe, affordable housing. As the District of Columbia is in the midst of near-record level growth and development, the availability of quality affordable housing is threatened like never before. But thanks to so many partners and supporters, Jubilee Housing exists as an alternative to current trends and market forces. Neighborhoods and communities can preserve affordable options for all of their residents. Affordable housing and supportive community can be sustained even in the most stressed housing markets.
