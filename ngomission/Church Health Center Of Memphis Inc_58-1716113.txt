The Church Health Center seeks to reclaim the Church's biblical commitment to care for our bodies and spirits.Dr. Scott Morris, a family practice physician and ordained United Methodist minister, founded the Church Health Center in 1987 to provide quality, affordable healthcare for working, uninsured people and their families. Thanks to a broad base of financial support from the faith community, and the volunteer help of doctors, nurses, dentists and others, the Church Health Center Clinic has grown to become the largest faith-based clinic of its type in the country. Currently, we care for 47,000 patients of record without relying on government funding. Fees are charged on a sliding scale based on income. The average visit costs about $25.
