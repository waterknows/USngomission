Aish NY's vision & mission aspires to engage and educate today's young Jewish adults in order that they live inspired Jewish lives, making active positive contributions to Jewish communities and society at large. We provide opportunities for them to meet like-minded young Jews, to gain greater Jewish knowledge and to form lasting relationships with Jewish mentors and role models.
