The Mission of Hope exists to provide Christian ministries during appropriate seasons of the year, including Christmas and Easter, through a system of delivering clothes, food, toys, and school supplies to impoverished families of the rural Appalachian region. In addition, the Mission of Hope assists in repairing existing homes or relocating to other homes, provides scholarships for qualifying children, assists in developing skills or expertise for the creation of new or expanded jobs in the area, and assists in locating jobs for persons who are willing to relocate outside the area.
