Iran Alive Ministries, was founded in 2001 by Dr. Hormoz Shariat. The ministry grew out of successful church planting among Iranian Muslims in Northern California. Through the use of satellite broadcast, in an effort to expand the ministry's reach to Iranian Muslims worldwide, the ministry began to have a significant role in the underground church planting movement in Iran.
