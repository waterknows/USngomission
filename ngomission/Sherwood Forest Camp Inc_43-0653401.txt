Since 1937, Sherwood Forest Camp has been transforming lives through camp experiences. Sherwood Forest Camp creates healthy, caring communities where children develop character and competence.

Our campers learn to respect all people and our environment, build strong relationships, take personal responsibility, solve problems cooperatively, resolve conflicts peacefully, and be positive leaders through service to others.
