Pheasants Forever (PF) is dedicated to the conservation of pheasants, quail and other wildlife through habitat improvements, public awareness, education and land management policies and programs. Since its inception in 1982, Pheasants Forever's wildlife habitat projects have benefited more than 5.3 million acres across the continent. Pheasants Forever launched Quail Forever (QF) in August of 2005 to address the continuing loss of habitat suitable for quail and the subsequent quail population decline. Pheasants Forever and Quail Forever members are a diversified group of hunters, non-hunters, farmers, ranchers, landowners, conservation enthusiasts and wildlife officials. PF and QF are for those who want to make a difference for wildlife by creating habitat, restoring wetlands and protecting prairies.
