Founded in 1979, the mission of Concerned Women for America (CWA) is to protect and promote Biblical values among all citizens - first through prayer, then education, and finally by influencing our society - thereby reversing the decline in moral values in our nation. We help people focus on six core issues, which we have determined need Biblical principles most and where we can have the greatest impact. These issues are: family, the sanctity of human life, education, pornography, religious liberty, and national sovereignty. CWA is a unique blend of policy experts and an activist network of people in small towns and big cities across the country working to address mutually held goals and concerns.
