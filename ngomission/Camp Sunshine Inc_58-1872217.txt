Founded in 1982, Camp Sunshine enriches the lives of Georgia's children with cancer and their families through recreational, educational and support programs. Camp Sunshine provides year-round programs which allow children with cancer and their families to share similar experiences and to participate in activities that promote normal childhood development as they cope with the challenges of childhood cancer.  Although Camp Sunshine began as a summer camp, programs now also include family camps, sibling camp, teen retreats, preschool and school age programs, support and educational programs for families, hospital based camp and a variety of activities throughout the year.
