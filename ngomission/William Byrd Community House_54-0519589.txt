MissionWe provide high quality educational, developmental and nutritional programs to children in the City of Richmond so they are academically, socially and emotionally prepared to succeed in school and in life.VisionWe know that healthy children who are reading at grade level when they enter third grade are more likely to succeed in school and go on to become productive, contributing members of their communities. It is our vision to create an environment for Richmond's children where reading is always an adventure, healthy eating is a way of life, and the child's family is an integral part of the education process.
