Founded in 1948, Gateway Rescue Mission exists to meet the physical and spiritual needs of the homeless. People come to us looking for a haven of rest. Gateway introduces the possibilities of a new life based on Jesus Christ. The first step is to get a good, hot meal in a person's belly. One must be shown the love of God before being told of His love. Food, a hot shower and clean clothes and safe shelter allow the seed of life to be sown. Our desire is to see a broken individual transform into a new person and ultimately re-engage with society and then share God's love with others. Gateway Rescue Mission offers life changing hope in the Gospel of Jesus Christ to homeless men, women and children through programs to deliver food, shelter, counseling and discipleship.
