The Boys and Girls Clubs of Elko works to inspire and enable all young people, especially those who need us most, to realize their full potential as productive, responsible, and caring citizens. Since its establishment, the Club has been enriching the lives of girls and boys other youth agencies had difficulty in reaching, and we are still dedicated to ensuring that the youth of our community have greater access to quality programs and services that will enhance their lives and enable them to become productive and caring citizens. Today, more than 2,000 girls and boys are taking advantage of the programs, activities, and services provided by Boys & Girls Club of Elko.
