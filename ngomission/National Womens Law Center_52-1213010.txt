The National Women's Law Center (NWLC) has been working since 1972 to expand the possibilities for women and their families at work, in school, and in virtually every aspect of their lives. NWLC focuses on major concerns of women and girls, including family economic security, education, employment opportunities, and health, with special attention given to the concerns of low-income women. Over more than three decades, the Center has used the law in all its forms - getting new laws on the books and enforced; litigating ground-breaking cases all the way to the Supreme Court; and educating the public about ways to make the law and public policies work for women and their families - to move closer to our vision of a nation without barriers based on gender.
