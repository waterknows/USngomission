Chabad of Thailand was founded in 1993 with the guidance and blessing of the Lubavitcher Rebbe. Its sole purpose is to "love every Jew, help every Jew, bring every Jew closer to his/her Jewishness" by providing spiritual, material and social support for all Jews regardless of their origin, affiliation or degree of observance. This creates an atmosphere of unity, which transcends all differences/levels of observance and guarantees Jewish continuity. American Friends of Chabad of Thailand supports religious outreach in Thailand by providing grants to multiple outreach centers located in Thailand and in surrounding areas.
