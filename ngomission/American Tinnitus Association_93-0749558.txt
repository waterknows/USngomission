The American Tinnitus Association (ATA) exists to cure tinnitus through the development of resources that advance tinnitus research. Since 1980, ATA has awarded more than $5 million providing researchers with seed money to launch their work. Tinnitus is the perception of sound in the ears or head where no external source is present. In almost all cases, tinnitus is a subjective noise, meaning that only the person who has tinnitus can hear it. People describe hearing different sounds: ringing, crickets, whooshing, pulsing, ocean waves, buzzing, dial tones, even music.
