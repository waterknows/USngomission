Mesa United Way's mission is to increase the ability of the people of our community to care for one another, and to ensure that core services for children, the disabled, the elderly and the needy are available in our community. We pursue our mission in concert with our schools, city government, businesses, faith organizations and non-governmental agencies to create the fabric of a healthy and livable community. Contributions are invested carefully in programs proven to work. Mesa United Way focuses on five areas of need: food, shelter and safety, growing strong children, special needs and disabilities, caring for the elderly, and safe and stable neighborhoods.
