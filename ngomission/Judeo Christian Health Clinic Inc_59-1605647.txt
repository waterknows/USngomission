Founded in 1972, the Judeo Christian Health Clinic provides free, quality care to thousands of people each year. Located behind St. John's Presbyterian Church in Tampa, the clinic houses an increasingly sophisticated array of medical, dental and optometric facilities and equipment. It is the largest and most comprehensive free clinic in the Southeastern United States. In the belief that we should do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with our God, the Judeo Christian Health Clinic provides free, quality, timely, and compassionate health care to the medically indigent residents of the Tampa Bay area who have no other resources for their health care needs.
