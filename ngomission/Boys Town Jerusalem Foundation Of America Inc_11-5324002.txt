The Boys Town Jerusalem Foundation of America raises funds for the development of a comprehensive education program for disadvantaged boys, mainly at the large campus in Israel. Founded in 1949 in response to the Holocaust, and dedicated to providing an outstanding education for Israeli children, regardless of race, class or socio-economic background, Boys Town Jerusalem is a residential school located within Israel's pre-1967 borders. It encompasses grades 7-12 and a two year College of Applied Engineering. The curriculum, which is monitored and approved by Israel's Ministry of Education, combines the timeless values of the Jewish heritage and advanced technology, while inspiring students to serve the State of Israel, as both soldiers and responsible citizens.
