Founded in 1971, Yavapai Big Brothers Big Sisters (YBBBS) mission is to enhance the lives of children through quality mentoring relationships. Many children grow up without the time, attention and direction they need from caring adults. Screened volunteers act as friends, mentors and role models to school-aged children who are predominately from single-parent homes. These relationships are supported by a professional staff. Mentoring is the single most effective way to positively impact the life of a child. Research tells us that compared to all other youth their age, boys and girls matched with a Big Brother Big Sister or Family Match are 40% less likely to get arrested.
