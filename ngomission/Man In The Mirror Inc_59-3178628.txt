In 1991, Patrick Morley, one of America's most respected authorities on the unique challenges and opportunities that men face, founded Man in the Mirror. At Man in the Mirror we work to engage every man in America with a credible offer of Christ and with resources to grow. We serve church leaders who are reaching men. Our desire at Man in the Mirror is to come along side pastors and men's ministry leaders who are equipping men for success. Man in the Mirror is accomplishing this through: men's Bible studies; Christian literature; seminars; leadership training and networking.
