Founded in 1981, The Greater Boston Food Bank is the largest hunger relief organization in New England, and one of the largest food banks in the country. GBFB was able to meet or exceed all of our organizational goals for the 2014 fiscal year. Highlights from the past year include: - GBFB distributed over 50 million pounds of food, or over 40 million meals to community members in need through our member agencies and programs. - Fresh produce accounted for one quarter of our overall distribution, a dramatic 230% increase from only three years ago. - 25,000 volunteers donated their time to GBFB, saving $1 million in labor costs. - GBFB's mobile markets and school-based pantries reached isolated and low-income communities with an average of 30 pounds of healthy food per household per distribution, such as frozen meats and fresh produce.
