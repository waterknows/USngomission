Teen Challenge of Southern California was established in 1963 and includes nine regional facilities with seven strategically placed residential facilities throughout Southern California. It is the mission of Teen Challenge to provide youth, adults and children an effective and comprehensive faith-based solution to drug and alcohol addiction as well as other life-controlling problems. Teen Challenge is committed to enabling and equipping those we serve to find freedom from addictive behavior, to become socially and emotionally healthy, physically well and spiritually alive. Last year Teen Challenge served over 200,000 men, women and children in Southern California through its resident and outreach programs.
