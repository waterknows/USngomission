Pacific Justice Institute (PJI) is a legal defense organization specializing in the defense of religious freedom, parental rights, and other civil liberties. PJI works diligently, without charge, to provide their clients with all the legal support they need. PJI's strategy is to coordinate and oversee large numbers of concurrent court actions through a network of over 1,000 affiliate attorneys nationwide. In addition, PJI offers the Legal Edge, a weekly radio commentary on religious liberty cases or issues in which PJI is currently involved. These commentaries serve both to inform and encourage the public, and the Christian community in particular, about the increasing battle to preserve First Amendment religious freedoms.
