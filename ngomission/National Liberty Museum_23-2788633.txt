The National Liberty Museum, opened to the public in 2000, works to defuse violence and bigotry by celebrating America's heritage of freedom and diversity. Using stunning modern glass artwork and the stories of 2,000 heroes of liberty worldwide, our galleries seek to inspire visitors on an individual level. A resource for more than 2,000 children every month, the Museum's Education Department features interactive diversity and conflict-resolution training. The Museum's collection includes over 150 original paintings, bronzes, and glass sculptures to represent the fragile nature of liberty. The National Liberty Museum is the first institution in the world to correlate freedom with glass for the purpose of protecting our society from violence.
