Founded in 1991, the National Legal and Policy Center (NLPC) promotes a single standard of ethics in public life through research, education and legal action. We do not believe that ethics are advanced through more laws or better guidelines, even as existing ones are ignored. We don't believe the problem is with too few laws, or with too much freedom, but with men and women. NLPC believes the missing ingredients are character, morality and common sense. We recognize that the bigger the government, the more opportunities for corruption; and the more intervention in the economy, the more reason for special interests to seek influence. At NLPC, we believe that the best way to promote ethics is to reduce the size of government.
