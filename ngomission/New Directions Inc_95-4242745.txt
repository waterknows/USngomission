Founded in 1992, New Directions for Veterans works to empower men and women who served in the military, and their families, to lead productive and fulfilling lives. New Directions for Veterans is committed to building a national community in which all at-risk veterans and their families lead lives of honor, dignity, well-being, and respect. New Directions offers a wide array of services, including substance abuse treatment, counseling, remedial education, job training and placement, as well as parenting and money management classes. Legal and tax assistance are available, as is an active aftercare program and resources for alumni.
