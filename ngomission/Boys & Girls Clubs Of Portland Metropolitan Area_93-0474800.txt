Boys & Girls Clubs of Portland Metropolitan Area enables all young people, especially those who need us most, to reach their full potential as productive, caring and responsible citizens. Since 1946, Boys & Girls Clubs of Portland has been providing thousands of young people throughout the Portland metro area with affordable, high-quality after-school and summer programs designed to help them develop the qualities needed to become responsible citizens and leaders. Our Clubs offer kids what they want most: safe, clean, fun places to go when they're not in school; caring adults who respect and guide them; and challenging programs that teach them life skills and keep them engaged in productive activities.
