Since its founding in 1900, Woodward Academy has embraced a philosophy of education that asserts the importance and uniqueness of the individual student. Over the years, the Academy has provided the student many special avenues of success in a structured and caring environment. Our motto - excellence, character, opportunity - expresses the long-standing commitment that enables Woodward Academy to make a positive difference in each student's education. Woodward is the largest independent school in the continental United States, with approximately 2,800 students who come from 24 metro Atlanta counties in a 50-mile radius of our Main Campus in College Park. Our student body is incredibly diverse, bringing together students from many different ethnic backgrounds and religious faiths.
