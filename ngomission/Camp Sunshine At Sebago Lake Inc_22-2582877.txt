Camp Sunshine supports children with life threatening illnesses and their families. The camp has the distinction of being the only program in the nation whose mission is to address the impact of a life threatening illness on every member of the immediate family - the ill child, the parents, and the siblings. Since its inception in 1984, Camp Sunshine has provided a haven for over 30,000 individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds. Our focus is on alleviating the strain that a life threatening illness takes not only on the sick child but also on other family members. Families have an opportunity to rebuild their relationships together and meet other families facing similar challenges.
