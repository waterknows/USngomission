The Lyford Cay Foundation (along with the Canadian Lyford Cay Foundation) was created to enhance and enrich The Bahamas and the lives of its people. To this end, we direct our resources into two principal areas: Increasing the availability of higher education and technical training for Bahamians, supporting local non-profit groups through financial contributions and volunteer initiatives. We have also helped secure almost $13 million in scholarship awards for Bahamian students from the colleges and universities they are attending.
