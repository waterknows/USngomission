The Council for Economic Education (CEE) is the leading organization in the United States that focuses on the economic and financial education of students from kindergarten through high school. For 65 years our mission has been to instill in young people the fourth "R"-a real-world understanding of economics and personal finance. We carry out our mission by providing professional development to teachers, teaching resources across the curriculum and nationally-normed assessment tools. We deliver our programs through in-person local workshops, partner organizations and online. It is only by acquiring economic and financial literacy that children can learn that there are better options for a life well lived, will be able to see opportunity on their horizon line and, ultimately, can grow into successful and productive adults capable of making informed and responsible decisions.
