Founded in 1798, Milton Academy is an independent college preparatory K-12 school, boarding and day in grades 9-12, located eight miles south of Boston. Milton Academy cultivates in its students a passion for learning and a respect for others. The active learning environment, in and out of the classroom, develops creative and critical thinkers, unafraid to express their ideas, prepared to seek meaningful lifetime success. How we attain our goals is what distinguishes Milton Academy from other institutions. Believing that a vital and effective community is built on the self-confidence and respect of individuals, we do our best to foster an atmosphere of intellectual freedom, to avoid standardized solutions to problems, and to encourage initiative and the open exchange of ideas.
