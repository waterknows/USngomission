Partnership for Excellence in Jewish Education (PEJE) is dedicated to positively impacting the day school field through initiatives that will help day schools tackle affordability issues, achieve financial sustainability, and implement effective advocacy campaigns. PEJE believes that day schools are essential for fostering an engaged Jewish people for an enduring Jewish future. To flourish, Jewish day schools must be destinations of choice for students, families, and philanthropic investment.
