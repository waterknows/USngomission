Caramoor is the legacy of Walter and Lucie Rosen who built the luxurious Mediterranean-style villa and filled it with their treasures. Walter Rosen was the master planner for the Caramoor estate, bringing his dream of creating a place to entertain friends from around the world to reality. Their musical evenings were the seeds of the International Music Festival of today. With its outstanding performances, engaging arts-in-education programming, the extraordinary Rosen House, and beautiful grounds, Caramoor is a cornerstone of the cultural life of Westchester County and beyond. Since 1945 visitors have delighted in the exceptional music - from classical to opera to jazz - and the enchanting garden setting that makes Caramoor such a unique and treasured resource.
