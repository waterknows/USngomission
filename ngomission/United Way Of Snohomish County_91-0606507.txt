For more than 68 years, United Way of Snohomish County has been the most effective and efficient way to make a difference here at home. We focus on the underlying causes of the most serious problems. Community leaders from all walks of life - business, government, nonprofits, and ordinary citizens - give financial support,

time and energy to United Way to create long-term, lasting change. These volunteer efforts empower us to touch lives with help and hope, making this a more compassionate, caring place to live for our kids, our families and our whole community. United Way of Snohomish County works for a community where kids matter; family matters; and community matters.
