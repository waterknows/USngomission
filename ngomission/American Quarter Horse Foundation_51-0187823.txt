The American Quarter Horse Foundation encourages support of worthwhile educational projects of interest and benefit to devotees of the American Quarter Horse. We own and operate the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame and Museum in order to preserve and interpret the history and modern uses of the breed through educational programs. We also offer scholarship support for selected members of the American Quarter Horse Youth Association and students pursuing education related to Quarter Horse racing. Since 1976, we have awarded over $4.7 million in scholarship assistance. Finally, we offer financial support for equine research; to date, we have awarded more then $7 million in research grants to collages and universities.
