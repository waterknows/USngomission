Founded in 1917, Buffalo City Mission exists to meet the spiritual and practical needs of the poor through the demonstration of the love and preaching of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Buffalo City Mission's vision is to restore hope to the homeless and hurting of Western New York. We provide emergency shelter and nourishing meals to thousands of homeless men, women and children. With the strengths of our Men's Center and our new state-of-the-art shelter for women and children, Cornerstone Manor, Buffalo City Mission provides comprehensive recovery programs to help homeless men, women and children rebuild stable, healthy, productive lives. We will continue to expand our services and develop innovative programs as the complexities of homelessness change.
