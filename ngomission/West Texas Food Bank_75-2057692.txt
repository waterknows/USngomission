For almost 30 years, West Texas Food Bank's mission has been to alleviate hunger through community partnerships. It all began in 1985, when a small group of concerned citizens joined together to provide needed food to those in our communities who have a hard time making ends meet. The Food Bank distributes over four million pounds of donated and purchased food each year to 75,000 people, working through 80 nonprofit partner agencies. These partners are essential in providing food throughout such a vast 19 county area, covering over 34,000 square miles of the Permian Basin and Big Bend. The Food Bank serves as a clearinghouse to solicit, store, inspect, and repack surplus and purchased food for distribution. We are a member of Feeding America, the nation's largest hunger-relief network, and a member of the Texas Food Bank Network. We also run Kids Caf√©, which provides healthy, nutritious afternoon snacks and evening meals to needy children in after-school child care programs.
