Founded in 1980, United Way of Central Louisiana's (UWCL) mission is to link people and resources for a stronger community in central Louisiana. UWCL dreams of a community in which all their neighbors are linked to each other and to the resources they need to prosper and thrive. UWCL serves nine parishes: Allen (Oakdale area), Avoyelles, Catahoula, Concordia, Grant, LaSalle, Rapides, Vernon and Winn.
