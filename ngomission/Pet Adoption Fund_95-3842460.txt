Pet Adoption Fund is an all breed, 501 (C) (3), Non-Profit, No-Kill Dog & Cat rescue and adoption organization founded in 1983, and it is located in the city of Canoga Park, Los Angeles county, CA. We are staffed primarily by volunteers, and exist solely on donations. Our mission is to rescue, shelter, and find loving permanent homes for the many wonderful, yet previously abandoned, neglected or abused companion animals. Since our inception in 1983, we have cared for, rehabilitated, and found responsible and happy homes for the thousands of pets who have come through our doors.
