Established in 1951, myFace, formerly known as the National Foundation for Facial Reconstruction, addresses the plight of children with a facial disfigurement by supporting state of the art treatment, innovative research, psychosocial support and medical training that inspires a new generation of pediatric doctors. To meet this mission, myFace founded and proudly remains the funding arm of the Institute of Reconstructive Plastic Surgery (IRPS) at NYU Medical Center. The Institute is a center of excellence that diagnoses and provides medical treatment and psychosocial services for over 1,700 patients every year, regardless of the severity of their condition, the length of treatment or the family's ability to afford care - 72% of the patients seen at the Institute are uninsured, Medicaid recipients or clinic care patients.
