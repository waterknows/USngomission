Love thy neighbor. That's the sentiment at the Urban Ministry Center where we see 500-600 of our homeless neighbors each day on our campus. They come to relieve their hunger in our Soup Kitchen, enjoy art or other community programs, to get treatment, to connect with our housing programs - to eventually take steps out of homelessness.
