In recognition of the severe impoverishment of single-parent families in Arkansas, the Arkansas Single Parent Scholarship Fund (ASPSF) was established in 1990. Modeled on successful incentive scholarship funds in two northwest Arkansas counties, the goal of the ASPSF is to assist low-income single parents to complete their post-secondary education in preparation for skilled employment. Our strategy is to work at the county level to organize affiliate scholarship funds operated by local residents and provide on-site assistance with all phases of affiliate development.
