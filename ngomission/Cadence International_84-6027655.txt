Cadence International is an evangelical mission agency dedicated to reaching the military communities of the United States and of the world with the Good News of Jesus Christ. For five decades, Cadence has grown from a small, fledgling mission to an organization with close to 200 missionaries who work in over 50 locations worldwide. Cadence serves all branches of the U.S. military in American and overseas locations. Comprised of nearly 4 million people, the U.S. military community has proven to be one of the largest, most responsive sub-cultures today. Cadence ministers not only to military personnel, but to their spouses and dependents as well. Cadence Student Ministries is the youth division of Cadence, reaching out to children and youth in the military community.
