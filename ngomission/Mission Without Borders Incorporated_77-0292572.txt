Mission Without Borders, Inc. works in six former-Communist Eastern European countries. MWB is dedicated to reaching people for Christ and dedicated to serving the spiritual, physical, educational, and emotional needs of those suffering the effects of poverty or persecution. MWB carries out various programs to accomplish our purpose. These programs are: Child Rescue Intl, Family-To-Family, Community Centers, Summer Camps, Operation Christmas Love, and Operation Winter Rescue. Our priority is to establish programs that have long-term sustainability, and do not create a reliance on aid. For this reason, our projects aim to empower individuals to become self sufficient, enabling people to reclaim their dignity.
