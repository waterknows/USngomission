The Urban League of Greater Oklahoma City was established in 1946 as an affiliate of the National Urban League and a United Way Partner Agency. Today, the Urban League serves more than 10,000 clients annually. Our mission is to assist African Americans, other minorities and the poor achieve social and economic equality. We work to accomplish this mission through advocacy, research and program services in five major areas: employment & training, children & families, entrepreneurship, urban health and affordable housing.
