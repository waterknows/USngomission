Founded in 1952, Young Audiences (YA) works to help make the arts an essential part of young people's education. YA advances the artistic and educational development of youngsters by bringing them together with professional artists of all disciplines to learn, create and participate in the arts. This year, YA's network of 30 affiliates and 4,600 artists reached seven million children in nearly 7,000 schools with 16,300 performance demonstrations, 60,000 workshops and 3,240 teacher services. YA and its affiliates are engaged in several network projects, including Arts for Learning Lessons, MetLife Dance for Life, and Arts for Learning Interactive Media.
