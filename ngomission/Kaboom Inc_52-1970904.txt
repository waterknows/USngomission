KaBOOM! is a national organization that envisions a great place to play within walking distance of every child. We passionately believe that play has purpose, and that unstructured play in particular helps make children happier, fitter, smarter, more socially adept and creative. Celebrating fourteen years of service in 2009, we rally individuals and communities to achieve better public policy, funding and public awareness for increased play opportunities. KaBOOM! inspires mass action for the cause of play, empowers individuals to take action on behalf of play and works to create playspaces through the participation and leadership of communities.
