The San Francisco SPCA is dedicated to saving, protecting and caring for cats and dogs while ending animal abandonment. We were the first humane society founded west of the Mississippi, now celebrating our 145th anniversary. As an independent nonprofit that receives no federal, state or local funding, nor funding from national organizations, we rely on donations from our supporters to provide our many programs and services. These programs include our state-of-the-art veterinary hospital, renowned adoption center, foster and hospice programs, feral cat program, youth programs that teach animal welfare and responsible pet guardianship, vaccine clinic for at-risk communities, dog training, and animal assisted therapy.
