Founded in 1960, Storm King Art Center is a museum that celebrates the relationship between sculpture and nature. Five hundred acres of landscaped lawns, fields and woodlands provide the site for postwar sculptures by internationally renowned artists. The focus of Storm King Art Center's distinguished permanent collection of American and European modern sculpture is on large abstract welded steel works from the 1960s to the present, although figurative works are also on view. At Storm King, visitors are encouraged to enjoy nature as well as art, to meander on trails and discover sculptures, or to traverse the fields to walk among monumental works. Recently the Art Center has developed the North Trail and a wooded grove with sculptures, and has restored several walking paths.
