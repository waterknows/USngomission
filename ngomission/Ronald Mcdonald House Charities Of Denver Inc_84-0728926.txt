Founded in 1979, Ronald McDonald House Charities of Denver provides a home away from home for families of children being treated at area hospitals and supports community programs that serve the needs of children. Our main focus is providing comfortable, low-cost housing to out-of-town mothers and fathers needing to be near their hospitalized children. Our largest residence, the Aurora House opened in March 2008. Only 7 years earlier a new Denver House was built. We award college scholarships to high school seniors and grants to community groups. Each summer, we host a mountain camp for children with cancer and their siblings. With the help of volunteers, Sky High Hope Camp welcomes kids from across America.
