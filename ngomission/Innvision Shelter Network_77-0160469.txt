LifeMoves, formerly IVSN, is the largest and most effective non-profit committed to ending the cycle of homelessness for families and individuals in Silicon Valley. As a results-driven organization, since 1987, our mission has been to provide interim housing and supportive services that create opportunities for homeless families and individuals to rapidly return to stable housing and long-term self-sufficiency. LifeMoves operates 17 major facilities, providing emergency, interim, and permanent supportive housing to the area's most vulnerable citizens. Underpinning all LifeMoves programming is our innovative therapeutic service model continuously proven to break the cycle of homelessness by driving transformation at the source of homelessness rather than treating the symptoms. LifeMoves envisions a world in which homelessness is eradicated and every person, regardless of their background and experience, is given equal opportunity to achieve a stable and sustainable lifestyle.
