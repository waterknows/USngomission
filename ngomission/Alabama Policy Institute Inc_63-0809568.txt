The Alabama Policy Institute, API is a non-partisan, non-profit research and education organization dedicated to influencing public policy in the interest of the preservation of free markets, limited government, and strong families, which are indispensable to a prosperous society. We do this by identifying, developing, and promoting innovative policy ideas and by providing fact-based, objective analysis of key issues. The mission of API is to provide information to the people of Alabama about the legislative issues being debated in Montgomery and Washington D.C. and to be a reliable resource to our elected representatives on public policy issues. As a conservative think tank, API addresses a wide range of emerging policy issues in the areas of economics, education, the environment, government, family and society.
