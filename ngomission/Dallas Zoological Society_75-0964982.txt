The Dallas Zoological Society works to support the Dallas Zoo as an outstanding center of education, entertainment and wildlife conservation. The Society supports this mission through: fundraising; volunteerism; promoting public awareness and participation; and enhancing the visitor experience. We exist to broaden support for worldwide conservation efforts by creating an environment which allows our community and visitors to experience dramatic, engaging and diverse presentations for the living plant and animal world through excellent animal management, solid conservation science (research) and dynamic educational programs.
