The Boys & Girls Clubs of the Big Bend was founded in 1991 to serve the needs of thousands of children and teenagers in the Big Bend area. We provide a positive and safe environment and a compelling alternative to drugs, crime and gang involvement. Our mission is “to inspire and enable all young people, especially those who need us most, to reach their full potential as productive, caring and responsible citizens.” Our number one goal is for every single of our Club Members to graduate from high school on time with a plan for his or her future.
