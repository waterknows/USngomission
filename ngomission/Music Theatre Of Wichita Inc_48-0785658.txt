Music Theatre of Wichita is dedicated to stimulating and nurturing interest in musical theatre by producing/or presenting Broadway quality productions while entertaining and educating patrons, the community and theatrical artists. MTWichita self-produces five Broadway-scale musical productions, using a unique mixture of top-flight professionals from Broadway and Hollywood, working hand in hand with talented Midwesterners. While producing its musicals, Music Theatre simultaneously conducts a specialized training program, geared to helping talented young Midwesterners prepare for professional careers. Largely because of this unique program, Music Theatre can boast young alumni onstage or backstage at almost every Broadway musical currently running, and most of the national tours.
