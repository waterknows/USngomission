Columbia University (CU) was founded in 1754 as King's College by royal charter of King George II of England. It is the oldest institution of higher learning in the state of New York and the fifth oldest in the United States. Today, Columbia is one of the top academic and research institutions in the world, conducting path breaking research in medicine, science, the arts, and the humanities. It includes three undergraduate schools, thirteen graduate and professional schools, and a school of continuing education. CU includes more than 4,000 faculty members and 23,000 students from 150 countries. At Columbia, we expect all areas of the university to advance knowledge and learning at the highest level and to convey the products of its efforts to the world.
