Price Tower Arts Center offers a one-of-a-kind experience: outstanding collections and exhibitions of art, architecture and design, high design hotel accommodations and exclusive shopping within a structure considered to be one of the great buildings of the 20th century. Frank Lloyd Wright's Price Tower was his pioneering experiment in the multi-use skyscraper: a tall, slim, richly detailed structure whose purpose was to combine business offices, retail and apartments. Today, Price Tower Arts Center continues to follow Wright's original design intent by offering a variety of opportunities for guests to learn from and interact with one of the master's greatest achievements.
