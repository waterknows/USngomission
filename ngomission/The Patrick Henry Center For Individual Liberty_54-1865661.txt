Inspired by the determination of our namesake, Patrick Henry, and his famous rousing call to arms, the Patrick Henry Center for Individual Liberty was born in 1998 with the intent of protecting and supporting all those who participate in Patrick Henry's powerful legacy of standing for free speech and political courage. Though the organization has grown in influence and scope over the years, the primary focus remains on the issue closest to our founder's heart- the plight of politically courageous whistleblowers who dare to risk their livelihoods, reputations, and very lives for the purpose of speaking truth to power, thereby protecting national security.
