The mission of Northeast Indiana Public Radio (NIPR) is to engage our community with content that enriches the human experience. NIPR is the licensee for WBNI, WCKZ, and W204BF. NIPR promotes and manages a non-commercial education and fine arts radio broadcasting station. We employ a staff of eleven, complemented by more than 50 regularly scheduled area volunteers who assist with on-air operations and off-air support.
