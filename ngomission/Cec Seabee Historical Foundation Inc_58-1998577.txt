Founded in September, 1991, the CEC/Seabee Historical Foundation's purpose is to ensure the proud heritage and rich history of the Navy's Civil Engineer Corps and the Navy's military construction force, the Seabees, are properly documented, preserved and maintained. Public awareness of the contributions and accomplishments of the Seabees and the Civil Engineer Corps is a primary goal. The Foundation is the private support arm of the CEC/Seabee Museum, providing funds for the improvement, expansion, and upgrade of the Museum. The development, restoration, and construction of major exhibits, displays, and artifacts are also funded.
