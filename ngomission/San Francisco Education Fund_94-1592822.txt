The San Francisco Education Fund acts as a bridge between the community and the classroom in order to increase the availability and impact of resources for students and teachers throughout San Francisco public schools. Our integrated approach: supports teachers with training and resources to enhance their classroom practice; matches volunteer skills with teacher requests; engages students to create positive changes in their schools; unites families, service providers, businesses and others to build stronger school communities; and informs district policy through community input and strategic partnerships. Implementing both school site and district level strategies enables the Education Fund to incubate and disseminate innovative approaches to improving student success and build a shared sense of responsibility to strengthen our public schools.
