WestSide Baby is a nonprofit organization that collects previously owned items for children and babies and distributes them free of charge to King County families in need. We work through local social service agencies already assisting low-income families. Agencies order items from us and deliver them to families who are homeless, living in transitional housing, or simply in need of a little help during a difficult time. We work toward a day when all babies and young children in our community have their basic physical needs met â€“ enough diapers, food, adequate clothing, appropriate toys, books, and safe equipment for their care.
