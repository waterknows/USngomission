Founded in 1999, Warren Family Mission is a Christ-centered rescue mission which provides food, shelter, clothing, spiritual and drug and alcohol rehabilitation help free of charge to participants from Trumbull County and its surrounding area. We work to serve our community in a way that helps people; recover from addictions, get back on their feet, rebuild broken relationships, restore families and become a vital part of a growing community with a positive influence. The mission has a six month program that includes mental, physical, financial, and spiritual guidance.
