Research at the Institute focuses on understanding the genetic control of normal development and disease susceptibility using the mouse as a model system. The Institute works to ultimately improve human health by conducting highly interactive and creative biomedical research aimed primarily at understanding the genetic basis of susceptibility to disease. Research results are disseminated through participation in organized educational programs, publications in scientific journals, and other means. The Institute is also committed to being a resource for science education and training for students and teachers in a rural region.
