MCC Theater was founded in 1986 as Manhattan Class Company, then a collective of young actors, writers and directors eager to take a leadership role in their own artistic development. Initial peer-based “classes” led to showcases and eventually to the kinds of full-scale productions that have made MCC Theater one of New York's leading off-Broadway theater companies. The philosophy and aesthetic on which MCC Theater was founded continues to fuel our work in three main areas of focus: annual productions to bring together exceptional artists to explore emotional and moral issues of contemporary life, development of new york by emerging and established playwrights, and education and outreach programs that encourage New York City high school students and recent graduates to find -- and use -- their own unique voices through the creation and performance of original work for the stage.
