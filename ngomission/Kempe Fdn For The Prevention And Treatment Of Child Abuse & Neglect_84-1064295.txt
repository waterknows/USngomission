Established in 1976, the Kempe Foundation for the Prevention and Treatment of Child Abuse and Neglect works to increase awareness, engage in advocacy, and secure and provide resources for the prevention and treatment of child abuse. The Kempe Foundation also provides fundraising, awareness and advocacy for the work of The Kempe Center. The Kempe Center's mission is to provide and improve direct clinical services, improve clinical service delivery systems, and provide training, education and consultation programs to prevent and treat child abuse and neglect in Colorado and throughout the nation. The Kempe Center and Foundation recently moved into its own home, a new 48,000 square foot facility located on the first three floors in the Gary Pavilion at The Children's Hospital.
