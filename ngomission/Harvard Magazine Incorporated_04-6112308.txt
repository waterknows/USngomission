Founded in 1898 by Harvard University alumni, the mission of Harvard Magazine is to keep alumni of Harvard University connected to the university and to each other. Harvard Magazine is an independently edited and separately incorporated affiliate of Harvard University. It is the only publication covering the entire University and also regularly distributed to all graduates, faculty and staff. The affiliation with the University gives Harvard Magazine the insider's point of view; our editorial independence means that we cover the University and its alumni with editorial objectivity and integrity. We try to bring the most interesting research and thinking being done at Harvard to our readers, connecting them with an intellectual experience, and raising contemporary social and political issues and reflecting upon them.
