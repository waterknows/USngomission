The SPD Foundation is a world leader in research, education, and advocacy for Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD), a neurological condition that disrupts the daily lives of an estimated one in twenty children and adults.

The mission of the SPD Foundation is to enhance the quality of life for children with SPD and their families by: conducting rigorous research into the causes, diagnosis, and treatment of SPD; providing education for those with SPD and for families, health care providers, policy makers, and the public; and conducting advocacy for recognition of SPD.
