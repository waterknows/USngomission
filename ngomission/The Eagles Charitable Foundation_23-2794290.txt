Eagles Youth Partnership (EYP) was founded in 1995 and serves over 50,000 low income children in the Greater Philadelphia region every year with a focus on health and education programming. EYP takes its services directly to kids at their schools and in their neighborhoods. Our signature mobile programs - the Eagles Eye Mobile and Eagles Book Mobile - leverage the celebrity and excitement of the Eagles football team, enabling us to capture the attention of some of the hardest to reach children. Additionally, EYP produces an extensive annual playground build, which brings spectacular new murals, mosaics, landscaping and even a mini Eagles practice field to area schools. The organization also partners with other local non-profits for a variety of vital youth programs.
