Founded in 1986, the mission of Big Brothers Big Sisters of Palm Beach and Martin Counties is to provide children facing adversity with strong and enduring, professionally supported one-to-one relationships that change their lives for the better, forever. We provide professionally supported adult mentors to children and youth in our community through one of our three proven programs: Community Based Mentoring, School Based Mentoring, or Career Skills Mentoring. Being a mentor, or Big, can have an incredible impact on the life of a child. All you have to do is be there.
