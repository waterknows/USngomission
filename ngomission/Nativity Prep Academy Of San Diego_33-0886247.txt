Nativity Prep Academy is a private, WASC-accredited, all-scholarship middle school in the Jesuit tradition dedicated to providing a rigorous and enriching education to hardworking young men and women from low-income families who will be the first, or among the first, in their families to graduate from college. Our programs support more than 230 students in middle school, high school, and college. We make an 11-year commitment to our students, continuing our support after middle school through a comprehensive Graduate Support Program, to assure our students transition to and succeed at a top regional high school and matriculate to college or university. Our Vision is to be a regional leader in the education of young men and women from impoverished families, well known for the caliber of its teachers, the rigor and creativity of its programs, and the academic and service achievements of its students. Our vision is that our students excel in high school, college, and career, and that they become role models and leaders in their communities.We believe the best hope for low-income children is a great education earned through hard work, founded on personal care, and focused on service to others.
