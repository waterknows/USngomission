Resist, founded 1967, is a progressive foundation that supports grassroots organizing for peace, economic, social, racial, and environmental justice, and provides political education for social change activism. For 48 years, Resist has funded groups that challenge reactionary government policies, corporate arrogance, and right-wing fanaticism through organizing, education and action. Today, Resist remains committed to radical social change, and the activist groups that are funded reflect Resist's goal of a much more equitable distribution of wealth and power both within and between nations. Resist funds groups in the US who struggle towards a broad vision of social justice, while continuing to oppose political and institutional oppression.
