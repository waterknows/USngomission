Housed in a gracious 19th century stone Victorian mansion on six acres in the Chestnut Hill section of Philadelphia, the Woodmere Art Museum first opened its doors to the public in 1940. Today, the permanent collection houses more than 2,500 works of art, much of it celebrating the art and artists of the Philadelphia region. Nine galleries and salons, including a grand rotunda and a uniquely designated Children's Gallery, provide superb space for exhibiting both the permanent collection and numerous special exhibits each year. Numerous public programs - lectures, tours, trips - and an impressive library and slide registry ensure that the community has ongoing access to a wide spectrum of art education resources.
