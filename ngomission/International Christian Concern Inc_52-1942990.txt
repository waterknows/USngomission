The International Christian Concern (ICC) is an interdenominational human rights organization dedicated to assisting and sustaining Christians who are victims of persecution and discrimination due to practicing their faith. Since 1995, we have been assisting the worldwide persecuted Christian church by providing assistance, awareness, and advocacy striving to exemplify faithfulness to our Lord and to our donors. We are non-denominational and support all Christians who affirm to the Apostles' Creed and believe the Bible is the inspired word of God.
