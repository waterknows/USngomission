Founded in 1882, the YMCA of Metropolitan Los Angeles puts Judeo-Christian principles into practice through programs that build healthy spirit, mind and body for all. We are dedicated to the objective of bringing people together in purposeful association to accomplish important personal and social goals. The 25 Los Angeles YMCAs bring together people of every age, race, and faith in programs that teach character, promote healthy living, support the pursuit of positive life skills and encourage the acceptance of responsibility. Through a lifetime of progressive YMCA membership experiences, members gain the desire and ability to contribute to a thriving, larger community. Being involved, as part of a community, not merely as the participant in an activity, is itself an essential ingredient in living a healthy life.
