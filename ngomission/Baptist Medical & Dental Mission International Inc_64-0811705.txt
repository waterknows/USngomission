Baptist Medical & Dental Mission International (BMDMI) exists under the Lordship of Jesus Christ to evangelize the lost, disciple the saved, and minister to the needs of the poor. Since its founding in 1974, BMDMI has served the poor of Central America through short-term mission teams that offer medical-dental care, planting local churches, and preparing Christian leaders. BMDMI also operates Christian schools, children's homes for abused and abandoned children, a hospital and permanent clinics, and vocational training centers. The staff and 2,500+ volunteers of BMDMI have made Honduras and Nicaragua our mission field, caring for the body and soul as Christ calls us to do.
