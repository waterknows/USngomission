The Rainbow Connection is a local organization that focuses its efforts exclusively on Michigan children and their families. Founded in 1985 by L. Brooks Patterson in memory of his best friend and two children who died in a plane crash, The Rainbow Connection is a Michigan-based charity dedicated to making dreams come true for Michigan children with life threatening illnesses and providing emergency support services to these families. To date, The Rainbow Connection has granted over 2,500 wishes to children across Michigan suffering from life-threatening or terminal illnesses. From something as simple as a new computer to meeting the President of the United States at the White House, to the most requested wish of all, a trip to Disney World, The Rainbow Connection grants wishes throughout the year.
