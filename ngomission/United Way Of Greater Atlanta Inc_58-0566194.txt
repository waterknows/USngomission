United Way of Greater Atlanta engages all segments of our community to drive sustainable change in education, income, health and homelessness while continuing to address urgent and basic human care. Our vision is for metro Atlanta to be a place where all individuals and families thrive. We are working on six important goals to ensure a strong community: ensuring that babies are born healthy; children enter school ready to learn and graduate prepared for careers; young people avoid risky behaviors; families are self sufficient; people have access to primary health care; and homeless people are housed within one year.
