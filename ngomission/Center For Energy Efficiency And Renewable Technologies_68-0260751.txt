The Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies (CEERT) is a public-benefit organization founded in 1990 originally to pool the combined resources of key public interest and environmental groups together with new energy technology private sector companies to jointly approach the California Public Utilities Commission for consensus policies to encourage greater utilization of renewable resources for utility electricity supplies. We have since expanded our activities before the full spectrum of federal, state, regional and local energy decision agencies and built our capacity to provide technical and policymaking assistance regarding cost effective, less polluting, and climate-friendly non-fossil fuel resources and technologies.
