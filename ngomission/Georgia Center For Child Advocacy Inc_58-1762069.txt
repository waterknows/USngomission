The mission of Georgia Center for Child Advocacy is to champion the needs of sexually and severely abused children through prevention, intervention, and collaboration. GCCA is the only organization of it type, providing intervention and treatment services to child abuse victims in the Greater Atlanta area, as well as child abuse prevention and awareness initiatives across the State of Georgia. These services are provided at no cost to child victims of abuse and their non-offending caregivers. The Georgia Center for Child Advocacy's role throughout the criminal investigation is to focus on the child's needs, rather than focusing on the crime itself. Since 1987, the Georgia Center for Child Advocacy has provided investigative and intervention services to any child in Fulton or DeKalb County suspected of having been a victim of child sexual abuse, severe physical abuse or was a witness to violent crime.
