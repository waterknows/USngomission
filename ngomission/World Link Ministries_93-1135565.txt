World Link Ministries is dedicated to training and deploying national leaders, promoting discipleship, and evangelizing un-churched people. We began as the Spanish Seminary for Theological and Evangelistic Training (Seminario Espa침ol de Formaci칩n Teol칩gica y Evangelizaci칩n) or SEFOVAN, founded in 1991 under the auspices of TEAM by Manny Fernandez, a graduate of Multnomah School of the Bible and Dallas Theological Seminary. World Link Ministries provides funding, administrative, and management support from its North American headquarters to SEFOVAN in Spain and other ministries in Italy, Romania, Ukraine, North Africa, Equatorial Guinea, Cuba, Mexico, and Vietnam.
