Advancing Native Missions (ANM) has been called to seek out, evaluate, and support native missions groups who have a clear and defined evangelical statement of faith, who are open and transparent in their finances, and who are working among unreached people groups. We share information about these native missions with evangelical churches and individuals in North America and other regions of the world who are willing to pray and give for the advancement of God's Kingdom through these ministries. ANM exists for one purpose: to help take the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the world's remaining unreached and unevangelized peoples. We do this by standing behind thousands of native missionaries who are reaching their own people for Christ in more than 100 countries.
