CSB Ministries builds godly men of today and tomorrow. CSB Ministries was founded in 1937 by Joe Coughlin, who dreamed that his Sunday school class of boys could become the nucleus of an army of Christian young men marching for the cause of Christ. The movement grew, molding thousands of boys into mature men of Christ. We train, equip and encourage men for ministry in general and ministry to young men and boys specifically. We empower men to use their own gifts, talents and experience to teach the truth of God's Word with insight and enthusiasm. Today, Joe's dream has been fulfilled many times over in Christian Service Brigade and Girls Alive.
