Founded in 1976, the International Center for Research on Women (ICRW) works to empower women, advance gender equality and fight poverty in the developing world. To accomplish this, ICRW works with partners to conduct empirical research, build capacity and advocate for evidence-based, practical ways to change policies and programs. ICRW seeks to promote a world free of poverty in which women and men, girls and boys have equal opportunities to achieve their potential and realize their rights. ICRW tackles the complexities of the world's most pressing problems - poverty, hunger and disease - by demonstrating that a focus on women and gender is necessary for lasting social and economic change.
