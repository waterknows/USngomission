Trees Atlanta is a nationally recognized citizens group that protects and improves Atlanta's urban forest by planting, conserving and educating. Founded in 1985, Trees Atlanta has been a prime force in addressing Atlanta's tree loss, creating increased green space, and conserving our city's trees. We have planted and distributed more than 100,000 shade trees, cared for more than 120,000 trees, recruited thousands of volunteers and educated an average of 3,500 children and adults annually about the importance of urban trees and how to plant and properly care for them. In addition to planting trees and educating the community, Trees Atlanta works with communities and municipalities to restore Atlanta's remaining forest spaces through its Forest Restoration program. Trees Atlanta has also begun work on a 22-mile linear arboretum along the Atlanta BeltLine, a series of unused rails encircling the city.
