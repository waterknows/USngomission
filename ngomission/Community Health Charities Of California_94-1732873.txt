Community Health Charities of California supports health charities fighting life-threatening illnesses. Contributions assist work with hospice programs, Alzheimer's, cancer, AIDS, Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, cystic fibrosis, and others. Established in 1971, Community Health Charities of California raises funds through workplace-giving campaigns to support the local California chapters of over 50 national and regional member health charities. Community Health Charities of California makes no decisions as to which charities receive funding. The donors determine which of our member charities receive money by means of donor designations.
