The Boy Scouts of America, Sagamore Council prepares young people to make ethical and moral choices over their lifetime by instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Law. Founded in 1972, our programs allow children and young adults to experience positive leadership from adult and youth leaders while taking on leadership roles of their own.
