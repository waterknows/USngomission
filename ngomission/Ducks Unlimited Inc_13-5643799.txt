The vision of Ducks Unlimited (DU) is wetlands sufficient to fill the skies with waterfowl today, tomorrow and forever. DU conserves, restores and manages wetlands and associated habitats for North America's waterfowl. These habitats also benefit other wildlife and people. 
The core values and guiding principles of Ducks Unlimited's team of staff and volunteers are: 

conserving North America's waterfowl and wetlands; 

acting to uphold the reputation of DU, treating people and wildlife with respect; 

evaluating our programs to guide us and ensure credibility; 

working together as volunteers and staff; 

valuing and enjoying the sport and heritage of hunting; 

partnering with those who share common goals and values; and 

celebrating the culture of DU as we serve our members.
