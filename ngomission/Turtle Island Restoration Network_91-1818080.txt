Turtle Island Restoration Network's (TIRN) mission is to take swift and decisive action to protect and restore marine species and their habitats and to inspire people in communities all over the world to join us as active and vocal marine species advocates. Our Sea Turtles Restoration Project provides public education, action, and hands-on conservation to protect endangered sea turtles and marine biodiversity worldwide. Our GotMercury project works to educate the public about the impacts of consuming mercury tainted seafood. Our Salmon Protection and Watershed Network (SPAWN) works to protect California's largest remaining run on endangered Coho salmon through research, restoration, public education and policy change.
