The Hemophilia Association of New Jersey (HANJ) was founded in August 1971 by 10 concerned families, and offers assistance to persons with hemophilia and their families from our office located in East Brunswick, New Jersey. Our mission is to improve the quality of life for persons with a bleeding disorder by providing and maintaining access to highly qualified medical treaters and successfully proven medical regimens. The services and programs HANJ offers its members are the life's blood of our organization. HANJ has a long history of innovative programs and legislative accomplishments. Services include our Insurance Grant; Hemophilia Homecare Standards; Campership and Scholarship programs; and the Women's Committee.
