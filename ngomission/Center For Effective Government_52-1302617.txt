The mission of the Center for Effective Government (formerly OMB Watch) is to build an open, accountable government that invests in the common good, protects people and the environment, and advances the national priorities defined by an active, informed citizenry.To ensure government is effective and responsive to the priorities of the American people, we conduct policy research and develop policy proposals; create tools to encourage citizen participation and government accountability; and build broad-based coalitions to advance these values. To ensure the American people understand the vital role of government, we produce and disseminate educational tools and communications materials. We are a resource for policymakers, the media, advocacy groups, community organizations, and the public.
