Partnership With Native Americans (PWNA) is a 501c3 nonprofit committed to championing hope for a brighter future for Native Americans living on remote, isolated and impoverished reservations. Collaborating with reservation partners, we provide immediate relief and support long-term solutions for strong, self-sufficient Native American communities. A BBB-accredited charity, PWNA provides consistent aid and services for Native Americans with the highest needs in the U.S. We care about quality of life and the self-determined goals of the tribes. Formerly known as National Relief Charities, we provide critical supplies; support education, community initiatives, and capacity building for emerging leaders; and connect outside resources directly to the reservations through our distribution network. PWNA programs (AIEF, ROAR, AIRC, SNRF, NAA, CIN, SWIRC and NRF) support education, Northern Plains and Southwest reservation aid, and animal welfare. PWNA provides aid for 250,000 Native Americans each year and yet there is more to do.
