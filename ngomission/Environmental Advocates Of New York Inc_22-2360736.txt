Founded in 1969, Environmental Advocates of New York's mission is to protect our air, land, water and wildlife and the health of all New Yorkers. Based in Albany, we monitor state government, evaluate proposed laws, and champion policies and practices that will ensure the responsible stewardship of our shared environment. We work to support and strengthen the efforts of New York's environmental community and to make our state a national leader. We are the New York State affiliate of the National Wildlife Federation (NWF) and confer regularly with colleagues in across the country through our membership in the State Environmental Leadership Conference.
