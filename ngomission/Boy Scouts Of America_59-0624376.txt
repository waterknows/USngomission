Boy Scouts of America, Central Florida Council was chartered in 1922 by the National Council to implement a quality scouting program to all youth in its geographic area. The Central Florida Council serves the youth of Brevard, Flagler, Lake, Orange, Osceola, Seminole, and Volusia counties. The mission of the Boy Scouts of America is to prepare young people to make ethical choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Law. Scouting has grown in meeting the needs of today's youth; teaching youth and adults to make value judgments and the importance of traditional values continue to make the Scouting program strong.
