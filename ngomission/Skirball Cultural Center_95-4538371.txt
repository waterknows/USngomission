The Skirball Cultural Center's mission is to explore the connections between 4,000 years of Jewish heritage and the vitality of American democratic ideals. Open to the public since 1996, the Skirball has established itself as one of the world's most dynamic Jewish cultural institutions and among the leading cultural venues in Los Angeles. It seeks to welcome and inspire people of every ethnic and cultural identity in American life. Guided by our respective memories and experiences, together we aim to build a society in which all of us can feel at home. The Skirball achieves its mission through: educational programs that explore the literary, visual, and performing arts from around the world; the display and interpretation of its permanent collections and changing exhibitions; an interactive family destination inspired by the Noah's Ark story; and outreach to the community. More than 600,000 people visit the Skirball each year, including 80,000 schoolchildren and their teachers.
