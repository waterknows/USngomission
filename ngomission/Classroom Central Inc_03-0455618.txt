Classroom Central equips students living in poverty to effectively learn by collecting and distributing free school supplies. Classroom Central ensures that all children living in poverty have all the tools they need to not only learn but to succeed. When equipped with the proper supplies, we believe there's no limit to what children can achieve. Classroom Central serves high-poverty schools in six school districts: Charlotte-Mecklenburg, Gaston, Iredell-Statesville, Union, Kannapolis & Lancaster.
