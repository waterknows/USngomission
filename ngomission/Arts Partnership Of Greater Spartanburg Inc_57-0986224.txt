The Arts Partnership of Greater Spartanburg (TAP) was founded in 1993. Our mission is to provide cultural leadership for greater Spartanburg by developing, strengthening and promoting the excellence, scope of educational role of the arts, humanities and sciences and furthering their financial strength, as well as their significance in the life of our community and the lives of its citizens. In addition to its work supporting nine community arts and cultural organizations, TAP directly funds, plans and implements a variety of annual programs of its own. From education programming that serves nearly 50,000 students and teachers in Spartanburg County every year to the CenterStage Series, which brings nationally renowned artists and speakers to the David Reid Theatre stage, TAP makes the arts accessible to people in a number of ways.
