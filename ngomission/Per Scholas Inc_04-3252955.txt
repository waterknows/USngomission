Founded in the South Bronx, Per Scholas is a 20-year-old nonprofit social venture that generates powerful free technology education, training and career opportunities for low-income, unemployed individuals. To date, we have provided training to more than 5,000 and placed more than 3,500 in jobs. In 2014, we will train at least 700 adults across five sites nationwide.In 2014, we were recognized by the White House for best practices in helping the long-term unemployed back to work. The Social Impact Exchange named us to its S&I100 index: the nation's top 100 nonprofits poised for growth. The Robin Hood Foundation has called our approach "indisputable proof that the American Dream still lives."Our approach is backed by strong results for nearly two decades, and our track record fuels our national replication as employers, funders, and government recognize our value and want to partner and invest in success.
