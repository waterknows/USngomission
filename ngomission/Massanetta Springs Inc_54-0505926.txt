Since 1922 Massanetta Springs has been providing God's people with welcoming hospitality and a beautiful place for rest, reflection, spiritual growth and renewal. Nestled on 200 acres of woodlands and meadows, our campus and facilities are an idyllic setting for a wide variety of events. Massanetta Springs is a place for discovery and renewal through worship, nurture and fellowship. We strive to make Massanetta Springs a place where guests experience God's grace and hospitality. Continuing a tradition of service since the early 1900s, our staff and facilities serve over 20,000 guests each year.
