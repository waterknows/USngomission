North Cascades Institute (NCI) seeks to inspire a closer relationship with nature through direct experiences in the natural world. Our mission is to conserve and restore Northwest environments through education. Since 1986 we have helped connect people, nature and community through science, art, literature and the hands-on study of natural and cultural history. Our goal is to help people of all ages experience and enjoy the mountains, rivers, forests, people and wildlife of the Pacific Northwest so all will care for and protect this special place. NCI is committed to innovation and excellence in environmental learning and leadership. We believe that sustainable communities are built on healthy environments, vibrant economies and social equity.
