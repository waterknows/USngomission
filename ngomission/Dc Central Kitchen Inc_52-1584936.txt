DC Central Kitchen uses food as a tool to strengthen bodies, empower minds, and build communities. Since our founding in 1989, DC Central Kitchen has prepared 27 million meals for our low-income neighbors in Washington, DC - but don't mistake us for a soup kitchen.The 5,000 meals we prepare each day are distributed at little or no cost to 80 homeless shelters, transitional homes, and nonprofit organizations, saving them money and nourishing their clients.Most importantly, we're working to shorten DC's line of hungry people by the way we're feeding it. In our main kitchen, we offer a rigorous Culinary Job Training program for unemployed men and women who want to replace homelessness, addiction, and incarceration with new careers and changed lives. Our graduates have averaged a 90% job placement rate during the recession, and we now employ 60 graduates in social enterprises that create living wage jobs, serve healthy food, and earn the majority of our annual revenue.
