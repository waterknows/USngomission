Created in 1988, the San Joaquin River Parkway and Conservation Trust works to preserve and restore San Joaquin River lands having ecological, scenic or historic significance; to educate the public on the need for stewardship; to research issues affecting the river; and to promote educational, recreational and agricultural uses consistent with the protection of the river's resources. In partnership with state and federal agencies and local governments, the River Parkway Trust has been successful in protecting land through fee title acquisition and wildlife habitat restoration. In addition, the River Parkway Trust provides outdoor education programs for school children and recreational opportunities for the community.
