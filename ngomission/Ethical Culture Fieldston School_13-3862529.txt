Ethical Culture Fieldston School (ECFS) was founded in 1878 by Felix Adler. His educational vision - to develop individuals who will be competent to change their environment to greater conformity with moral ideals - is as important today as it was when ECFS was founded. We continue to realize that vision by exploring what it means to be an ethical and responsible member of society, valuing inclusion and economic and racial diversity, striving for academic excellence, and teaching students to become independent thinkers through progressive education. ECFS provides educational instruction for approximately 1,670 students in various classes from pre-kindergarten through the twelfth grade. Our school challenges students to reach their highest potential in body, mind and spirit through the humanities, sciences, the arts and physical education.
