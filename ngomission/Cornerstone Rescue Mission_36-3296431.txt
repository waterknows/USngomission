The CornerStone Rescue Mission, established in 1981 in Rapid City, South Dakota, serves the physical and spiritual needs of more than 500 people everyday and we've impacted the lives of thousands more over the years. Many have gone on to lead fulfilling, independent lives and contribute to the community in many ways. The Cornerstone Rescue Mission is the main provider of shelter and the only ongoing and free source of meals for the homeless in the Black Hills region.
