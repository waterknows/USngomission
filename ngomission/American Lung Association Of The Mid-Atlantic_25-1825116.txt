The American Lung Association is the nation's oldest voluntary health agency originally organized to fight a specific disease, that being tuberculosis. Since 1892, the American Lung Association of the Mid-Atlantic (ALAMA) has been fighting lung disease through education, community service, advocacy, and research. Our mission is to save lives by improving lung health and preventing lung disease. ALAMA serves the areas of Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. We offer a number of programs throughout the state that are designed to help people quit smoking, learn to live with and control their asthma, prevent children from smoking, and many other lung health problems.
