The Samaritan Inn began in 1984, and today is the largest residential homeless program in Collin County. We serve the mission "We are a comprehensive homeless program that helps willing people regain dignity and independence". The Samaritan Inn teaches self-sufficiency and life skills through its Transitional Residential Shelter Program to help people regain sustainable employment and permanent residency. In 2014, we sheltered 624 individuals, 218 children and 406 adults.
