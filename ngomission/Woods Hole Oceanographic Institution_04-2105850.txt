Founded in 1930, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) is dedicated to research and education to advance understanding of the ocean and its interaction with the Earth system, and to communicating this understanding for the benefit of society. Its primary mission is to develop and effectively communicate a fundamental understanding of the processes and characteristics governing how the oceans function and how they interact with the Earth as a whole. WHOI promotes and develops the use of advanced instrumentation and systems (including ships, vehicles and platforms) to make the required observations at sea and in the laboratory. WHOI makes the results of its research known to the public and policymakers and foster its applications to new technology and products in ways consistent with the wise use of the oceans.
