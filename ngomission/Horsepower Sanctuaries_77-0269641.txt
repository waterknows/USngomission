Created in 1991, Redwings Horse Sanctuary works to eliminate the causes of equine suffering through education and community outreach programs, rescue abused and neglected equines, and provide permanent sanctuary or select foster homes for those equines. The Sanctuary also addresses educational, financial, and other factors behind equine neglect. Our programs include an equine education program for new owners, and an equine medical assistance program for low-income owners. In 2000 Redwings moved to a 167-acre ranch in southern Monterey County, California. Redwings has provided permanent sanctuary to hundreds of equines that had been in abusive and/or neglectful situations, and placed more than 30 equines in securing, caring foster homes.
