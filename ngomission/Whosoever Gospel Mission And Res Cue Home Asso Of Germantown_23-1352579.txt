The Whosoever Gospel Mission is a Christian nonprofit organization whose purpose is to provide shelter, food, clothing, education, counseling, rehabilitation and other assistance to homeless and/or needy men, women and children in the Philadelphia Metropolitan Area. As the lighted sign on our rooftop proclaims each night, we seek to offer the love of Jesus and the hope of the Gospel in both word and deed to those who are hurting. We operate our residential New Life Program for homeless men year-round, and we anticipate opening Hannah's Place, a residential facility for homeless or needy moms and their young children, in the future.
