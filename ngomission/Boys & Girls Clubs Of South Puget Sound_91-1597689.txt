Boys and Girls Clubs of South Puget Sound enables all young people, especially those who need us most, to reach their full potential as productive, caring, responsible citizens. Boys & Girls Clubs programs have taken members from the Clubhouse to the White House; from the games room to the corporate boardroom; from the high school orchestra to Carnegie Hall. Boys & Girls Clubs give Kids a place to call their own, where they can have fun, get a hot meal, be creative, be a part of a team, get help with homework...or just hang out with friends. We offer safe, fun, inclusive, and inspiring places that Kids and their families count on--every day.
