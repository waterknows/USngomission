The mission of Christian Life Resources is to use life and family issues as bridges to convey the love of God and to share the message of salvation through Christ. This organization educates people on what God's Word has to say about the value and sanctity of human life. The intent is to mobilize Christians to make God-pleasing decisions about life and family issues. We focus attention on many issues such as: abortion, infertility, birth control, post-abortion syndrome, infanticide, medical directive statements, assisted suicide, and euthanasia. To date, the organization consists of 24 chapters which operate 22 pregnancy counseling centers across the United States. These centers are visited by approximately 4,000 clients each year.
