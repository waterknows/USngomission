Founded in 1966, the Naval Aviation Museum Foundation (NAMF) is the educational and fundraising organization that supports the development of the National Naval Aviation Museum. NAMF works to foster and perpetuate the National Museum of Naval Aviation as a medium of informing and educating the public on the important role of US naval aviation, inspiring students undergoing naval flight training to complete the program and become career officers. NAMF's programs include a flight simulator, which allows visitors to experience the simulation of actual flight take-off and landing; the film project and IMAX theater, which educate the public on the important role of US naval aviation through films; and the Flight Adventure Deck, a hands on approach to teaching principles of math and science - integral components of aviation - to approximately 6,000 students in grades 7-12.
