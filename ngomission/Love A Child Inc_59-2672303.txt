Love A Child, Inc. is a Christian humanitarian organization working to spread the word of God and show the love of Jesus by example, as we minister to the poorest of the poor in Haiti. With the help of our partners, our outreach programs have established 15 churches in remote villages; started and operate 15 Love A Child schools, where we educate and feed over 5,000 children each day; conduct food distribution programs that feed thousands of Haitian families; hold remote medical clinics and operate a regional medical clinic; and operate a top-rated orphanage which is now home to more than 70 Haitian children. We oversee many other projects to benefit the poor in Haiti. We have great hope for these children and families. Our dream is for them to grow up as strong Christians and receive the best possible education, even college.
