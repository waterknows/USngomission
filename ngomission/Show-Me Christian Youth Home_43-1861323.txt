Founded in 1967, Show-Me Christian Youth Home is dedicated to providing a loving, stable, Christian home for children with backgrounds of abuse, neglect, abandonment and unfortunate circumstances. It is our goal to help children realize we love them, God loves them, and they can learn to love themselves. We feel there are four major areas essential in this complete development process: spiritually, academically, emotionally, and physically.
