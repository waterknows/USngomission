The New Memphis Institute trains leaders with a mission - to develop their personal potential so Memphis reaches its full potential. All that is done contributes to a mission with a purpose: leadership that ripples from New Memphis' programs and improves all facets of Memphis- neighborhoods, schools, government, economic development, and civic life. Some of the most important impacts are those made through the Community Action Projects which help local nonprofits deliver on their missions.
