Habitat for Humanity of East Jefferson County seeks to put God's love into action, Habitat for Humanity of East Jefferson County brings people together to build homes, communities and hope. Habitat offers people a hand up rather than a handout. Community volunteers work side by side with neighbors in need to build and repair houses. Habitat homeowners pay back the cost of their housing materials through an affordable, no-profit mortgage. Their mortgage payments, together with donations from the public and earnings from two second-hand furniture stores, build more houses. Neither religion nor race is a factor in choosing the families who receive Habitat houses.
