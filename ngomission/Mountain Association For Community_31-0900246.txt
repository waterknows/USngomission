The Mountain Association for Community Economic Development (MACED) partners with local people to build upon the strengths of Kentucky and Central Appalachia. We create economic alternatives and strive to make Appalachian communities better places to live. Since 1976, MACED's commitment to the communities of Central Appalachia has shown us that high expectations, vision and hard work are essential to accomplish results. Three core strategies help us work toward our goal of transforming the lives of people and places in need in Central Appalachia through sustainable development.
