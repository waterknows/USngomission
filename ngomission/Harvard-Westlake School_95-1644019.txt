Harvard-Westlake School is an independent coeducational college preparatory day school, grades 7-12. It is the result of a merger between Harvard School, founded in 1900, and Westlake School for Girls, established in 1904. Coeducation began in September of 1991. The school strives to provide an education which enables and empowers its diverse students to develop their intellectual, spiritual, emotional, and physical gifts; to understand and respect the similarities and differences among themselves and others in their local and world communities; and to learn the habits of mind and self-discipline necessary to live with integrity and purpose as contributing members of society.
