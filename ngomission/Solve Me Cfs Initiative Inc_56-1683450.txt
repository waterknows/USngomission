The Solve ME/CFS Initiative (formerly known as the CFIDS Association of America) was founded in 1987 and has established itself as the leading charitable organization dedicated to chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) - also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) and chronic fatigue and immune dysfunction syndrome (CFIDS). Our mission is to make ME/CFS widely understood, diagnosable, and treatable by stimulating participatory, patient centered research aimed at the early detection, objective diagnosis and effective treatment of ME/CFS through expanded public, private and commercial investment.
