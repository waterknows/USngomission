The Crossroads Nogales Mission was founded in October 1995 by Ben and Bert Wenke. It is a Christ centered recovery program serving the needs of individuals, developing life skills, giving the disadvantaged, homeless and poor a better quality of life and providing a full range of opportunity for restoration to obtain a productive and stable life. The Mission started with a homeless shelter for men and women. A few weeks later a community lunch program was started and today we have four shelters, five programs for men and women, a domestic violence shelter for women and children, holiday meals, and Bible clubs for children five times a year. Last year we were able to feed over 35,000 individuals thanks to the financial generosity of our donors. Our newest addition is the Crossroads Family Fellowship Center which was dedicated February 18, 2009.
