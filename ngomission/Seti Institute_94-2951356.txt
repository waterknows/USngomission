Founded in 1984, the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) Institute is dedicated to scientific research, education and public outreach. Its mission is to explore, understand and explain the origin, nature and prevalence of life in the universe. We believe we are conducting the most profound search in human history to know our beginnings and our place among the stars. This mission encompasses projects covering a broad range of disciplines that include: astronomy and planetary sciences, chemical evolution, origin of life, biological evolution, cultural evolution, and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. The Institute comprises three centers, the Center for SETI Research, the Carl Sagan Center for the Study of Life in the Universe and the Center for Education and Public Outreach.
