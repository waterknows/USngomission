Faith Radio serves the Christian community and strengthens the family unit and the local church as we provide spiritual encouragement and personal challenge with a Christ-centered focus, through biblical teaching, relevant information and uplifting music to the glory of God. We operate radio stations in Central and South Alabama that broadcast religious and educational programming.
