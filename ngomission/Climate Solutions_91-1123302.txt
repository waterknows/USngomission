Climate Solutions aims to accelerate practical and profitable solutions to global warming by galvanizing leadership, growing investment, and bridging divides. We have pioneered the vision and cultivated the political leadership in the Northwest for the proposition that clean energy and broadly shared economic prosperity can go hand-in-hand. For over 15 years, we have led successful initiatives to deliver climate and clean energy policies, models, and partnerships that accelerate the transition from fossil fuels to a clean energy economy.
