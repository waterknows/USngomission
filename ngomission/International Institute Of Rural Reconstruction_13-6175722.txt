The International Institute of Rural Reconstruction (IIRR), is a rural development organization working in Africa and Southeast Asia. Formally incorporated in 1960, IIRR promotes people-centered development through capacity building for poor people and their communities, other development organizations and governmental agencies. We believe that communities can help themselves out of poverty if we can provide the stimulus. The US Office coordinates fundraising activities from all sources in the U.S.; promotes the public profile of IIRR within the U.S.; assists senior IIRR staff in partnership building and networking with U.S. based organizations; and acts as a liaison between IIRR and its board of trustees in the U.S.
