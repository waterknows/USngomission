Organized in 1984, Concerns of Police Survivors (COPS) provides resources to assist in the rebuilding of the lives of surviving families and affected co-workers of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty as determined by Federal criteria. Furthermore, COPS provides training to law enforcement agencies on survivor victimization issues and educates the public of the need to support the law enforcement profession and its survivors. COPS programs for survivors include the National Police Survivors' Conference, scholarships, peer-support at the national, state, and local levels, COPS Kids counseling reimbursement program, the COPS Kids Summer Camp, COPS Teens Outward Bound, special retreats for spouses, parents, siblings, adult children, and in-laws, trial and parole support, and other assistance programs.
