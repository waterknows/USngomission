United Way of Brevard's mission is to be Brevard's leader in mobilizing the caring power of our community. United Way of Brevard County was started in 1957 by a group of concerned individuals who wanted to help those who were in need. United Way is about people helping people. We care deeply about our friends and neighbors in Brevard. United Way is about accountability - taking action and producing measurable results. We also ensure that our partner agencies can provide measurable outcomes so that you can see the real difference you are making here at home. United Way is continually exploring new ways to solve community problems. Through partnerships with governmental agencies, community leaders, neighborhoods and many other groups, we are working as never before to address our community's most pressing needs.
