New England Wildlife Center is a native wildlife preservation and educational organization located in South Weymouth, Massachusetts. We provide rehabilitation animal habitat and environmental protection, affording humane care to native and naturalized wild animals through our wildlife medicine hospital. Our humane wildlife rehabilitation hospital and education center is staffed with licensed veterinarians and certified veterinary technicians who care for sick, injured and orphaned native animals. All activities in the hospital serve an educational function. We care for 225 naturalized and native animal species of New England. Our goal is to provide care for sick, injured and orphaned wild animals to enable them to become healthy, self-reliant members of the native habitat.
