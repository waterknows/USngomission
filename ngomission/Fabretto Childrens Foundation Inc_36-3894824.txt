Fabretto provides program services to more than 18,000 children and youth in Nicaragua, through seven community education centers and more than 50 rural schools. The organization's mission is to empower underserved children and their families in Nicaragua to reach their full potential, improve their livelihoods, and take advantage of economic opportunity through education and nutrition. Fabretto works in partnership with students, families, and communities to achieve this goal through five strategic program areas: Early and Primary Education Enrichment, Rural Secondary Education, Vocational & Life Skills Education, Food Security & Nutrition and Community Well-being & Development. Inspired by the legacy of Father Rafael Fabretto, the organization envisions a prosperous Nicaragua where all children and youth have meaningful opportunities to grow and learn, in communities that offer access to quality education.
