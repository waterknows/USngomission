Samaritan's Feet is a 501(c)(3) humanitarian aid organization that shares a message of hope and love through washing the feet of impoverished children around the world and adorning them with new shoes. There are an estimated 1.2 billion children who go without shoes every day and more than one million that die each year from foot borne diseases. The goal of Samaritan's Feet is to provide 10 million pairs of shoes for children in the next 10 years. Since its founding by Manny Ohonme in 2003, Samaritan's Feet and its team of ambassadors and partners have blessed more than five million children in more than 60 nations.
