Founded in 2002, the mission of Miles Perret Cancer Services is to help families fight, survive, and live with cancer. Our mission is founded on the principle that life is sacred, and quality of life should not be forgotten or neglected, particularly when battling cancer. Many cancer patients and their families need the organized and deliberate support of a cancer services center invested in their welfare and healing. They need Miles Perret Cancer Services.
