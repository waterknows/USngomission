The Friedreich's Ataxia Research Alliance (FARA) is a national, public, 501(c)(3), non-profit, tax-exempt organization dedicated to curing Friedreich's ataxia (FA) through research. FA is a debilitating, life-shortening, degenerative neuromuscular disorder affecting one in 50,000 people in the United States. FARA focuses on grant making for FA research and building collaborations with organizations dedicated to advancing treatments for FA. Due to the progressive nature of the disease and the promise of treatments in development, there is urgency to our efforts. Directing attention and resources to FA research and partnering with others who share this commitment, FARA believes we can help bring forward the first effective treatments and a cure for FA.
