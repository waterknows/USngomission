The Santa Barbara Rescue Mission (SBRM) is a ministry of Christian people bringing physical, emotional, educational and spiritual resources to men, women and children in need, particularly those struggling with addictions. Since our founding in 1965, we have grown into an organization that provides immediate help--in the form of food and shelter 365 nights a year to those with no place else to go. SBRM provides lasting hope in our 12-month residential recovery program for men and women desiring to break free from cycles of addiction, poverty, homelessness and crime. This care is given by an exceptional staff, most of whom have been there and bear witness to the fact that God's love can rebuild lives and transform even the most desperate circumstances.
