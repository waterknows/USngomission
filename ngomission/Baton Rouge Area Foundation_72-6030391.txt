The Baton Rouge Area Foundation (BRAF) provides two essential functions for the capital region. One, the Foundation connects philanthropists with capable nonprofits to make sure the needs of our communities are met. Two, the Foundation invests in and manages pivotal projects that can change the community. Since 1964, we have made tens of thousands of grants totaling more than $225 million. Nonprofits have used the grants to feed and clothe people, protect the abused, preserve the wilderness, create an arts center, educate children who deserve a second chance, protect young girls from cancer, revive downtown Baton Rouge and raise more than $45 million for hurricane relief.
