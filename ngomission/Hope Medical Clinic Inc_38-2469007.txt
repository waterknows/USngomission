Founded in 1987, Hope Clinic, an interdenominational Christian organization, provides compassionate and practical help to those in need, ministering to the whole person with dignity and respect. We offer medical care and dental care to the uninsured, plus a variety of social services to minister to the whole person. Hope partners with many local churches, plus a number of agencies and others to ensure that our patients and clients receive the comprehensive care that they need.
