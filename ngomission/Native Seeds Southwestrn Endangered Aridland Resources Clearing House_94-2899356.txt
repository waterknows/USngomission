For 25 years, Native Seeds/SEARCH (NS/S) has endeavored to conserve the rich legacy of agro-biodiversity in the arid Southwest because of its genetic potential and cultural importance. NS/S conserves, distributes, and documents the adapted and diverse varieties of agricultural seeds, their wild relatives and the role these seeds play in cultures of the American Southwest and Northwest Mexico. We envision the Greater Southwest as a place where farms and gardens, kitchens and tables, stores and restaurants are brimming with the full diversity of arid lands-adapted heirloom crops; people are keeping the unique seeds and agricultural heritage alive; and the crops, in turn, are nourishing humankind.
