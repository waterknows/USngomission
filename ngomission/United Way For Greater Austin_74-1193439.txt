United Way Capital Area addresses critical social issues by bringing people and resources together to create opportunities for individuals, families and neighborhoods to prosper. United Way Capital Area is working to advance the common good by focusing on education, financial stability and health. These are the building blocks of a good life-a quality education, enough income to support a family through retirement, and good health. By bringing together people and resources to address these issues, and by attacking their underlying causes, we hope to make lasting, fundamental change---for everyone.
