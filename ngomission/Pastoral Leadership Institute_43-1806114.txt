The Pastoral Leadership Institute (PLI) launched in response to the need for missional leadership training for pastors as well as a concern over the steady decline in church membership in our Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod. Today, PLI continues to look at advanced leadership training as an opportunity to involve not only the pastor and his spouse, but also the congregation and community members. PLI's emphasis on personal accountability and multiplication of leaders continues to provide the common core across every PLI program and module. By God's grace, leaders will continue to grow, communities will continue to transform, and God's people will continue to grow in number and depth of discipleship throughout the world.
