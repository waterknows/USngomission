Founded in 1975, WhyHunger (aka World Hunger Year) is a leader in the fight against hunger and poverty in the United States and around the world. WhyHunger advances long-term solutions to hunger and poverty by supporting community-based organizations that empower individuals and build self-reliance, i.e., offering job training, education and after school programs; increasing access to housing and healthcare; providing microcredit and entrepreneurial opportunities; teaching people to grow their own food; and assisting small farmers. WhyHunger connects these organizations to funders, media and legislators. At WhyHunger, we envision a world without hunger and poverty. If we can shift the prevailing viewpoint on why hunger and poverty exist, then we can influence the policymakers and put an end to this human tragedy.
