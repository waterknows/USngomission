Orphan Grain Train (OGT) is a Christian volunteer network that shares personal and material resources with needy people in America and around the world. Grain Train volunteers gather donations of clothing, medical supplies, food, Christian literature, and other aid to meet real needs. Since 1992, Orphan Grain Train's 23 regional divisions have delivered nearly 35 million pounds of humanitarian aid to needy people in 64 countries and in 25 states for victims of natural disasters. Grain Train's regional divisions collect, pack and ship more than 125 semi-loads of donated clothing, relief supplies and humanitarian aid each year. Many shipments have been in cooperation with Lutheran Hour Ministries, LCMS World Mission, LCMS World Relief, and other Christian ministries.
