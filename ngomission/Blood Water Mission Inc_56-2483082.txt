Blood:Water Mission is a grassroots organization that empowers communities to work together against the HIV/AIDS and water crisis. Founded by the multi-platinum, GRAMMY Award-winning band, Jars of Clay, Blood:Water Mission began as a call to personalize the HIV/AIDS crisis in Africa. The members of the band were committed to share the often-untold stories: those of creative, compassionate, hard-working Africans bringing health, hope and healing into their respective communities. Since its launch, Blood:Water Mission has raised millions of dollars from individuals seeking to make a difference. We have partnered with more than 800 communities in Africa, providing life-saving water and health needs for over 500,000 people.
