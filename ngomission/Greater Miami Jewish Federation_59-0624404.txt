Founded in 1938, the Greater Miami Jewish Federation exists to ensure that we act collectively and responsibly to meet the needs and safeguard the freedoms of all Jewish people. Since its inception, the Federation has worked to build our community and enrich the quality of Jewish life in the Greater Miami area. Governed by a committed and dynamic volunteer Board of Directors, the Federation brings together the people, services, resources and leadership necessary to secure a strong and vibrant Jewish community for generations to come. The Greater Miami Jewish Federation reaches all segments of our unique local population by advancing Jewish continuity while supporting a broad range of vital human services at home and abroad.
