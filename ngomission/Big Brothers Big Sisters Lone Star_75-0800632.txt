Big Brothers Big Sisters Lone Star is the largest Big Brothers Big Sisters agency in the world. As a donor-supported volunteer youth mentoring organization, our program has been placing caring adults in the lives of children in one-to-one mentoring relationships since 1927. Through the positive impact of those friendships, children with a Big Brother or Big Sister are more likely to graduate from high school and are less likely to begin using drugs, begin using alcohol or engage in negative conflict. Our professional staff carefully works with both the volunteers and the children to ensure that the experience of Big Brothers Big Sisters is one that is dynamic, fulfilling, memorable and enjoyable for both the child and the volunteer.
