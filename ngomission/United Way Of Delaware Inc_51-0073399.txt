United Way of Delaware's (UWD) mission is to maximize the community's resources to improve the quality of life for all Delawareans. United Way of Delaware partners with social service agencies, businesses, government, other nonprofits, and concerned individuals to achieve results that matter and a lasting impact on the quality of life in our community. In 2006, United Way celebrated 60 years as Delaware's premier fundraiser for health and human service programs in our community. But UWD is much more than a fundraiser. Today, UWD is a bridge linking community leaders and agencies together to address Delaware's most pressing problems via these focus areas: Success By Six; strong families, strong children; healthy and independent communities; financial stability; and strong neighborhoods.
