Since 1943, YouthFront has engaged in innovative youth ministry, ministering to millions of young people. YouthFront engages in many strategies to minister to today's adolescents. But more important than programs, processes, or events, YouthFront is about people--from the thousands of youth involved in YouthFront to the staff, volunteers, youth workers, donors, and all the rest who are passionate about helping those young people to know Jesus Christ. The YouthFront staff believes first and foremost that we must be people who live and do youth ministry out of the fullness of their life with God. We all share a common focus and desire and it is summed up by our mission statement to bring youth into a growing relationship with Jesus Christ.
