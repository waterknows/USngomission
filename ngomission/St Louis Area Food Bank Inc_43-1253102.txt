The St. Louis Area Foodbank feeds hungry people by distributing food through its member agencies, and educates the public about the nature of and the solutions to the problems of hunger. We gather and distribute nearly 13.4 million pounds of food each year to 500+ food pantries, homeless shelters, soup kitchens and emergency feeding programs throughout 14 counties in eastern Missouri and 12 counties in southwestern Illinois. We help the elderly, single-parent families and the working poor. Children comprise the largest segment of the population in need of food. Hunger does not discriminate. It affects poor and homeless people in urban and rural areas.
