The Latin School of Chicago, founded in 1888, is a co-educational independent day school for students in grades junior kindergarten through twelve. The school was designed to provide students with a rigorous college-preparatory education in the classical tradition, with a curriculum that was heavily influenced by Classical studies and the study of the Greek and Latin languages, hence the name "Latin School." Latin is still taught at the school today and is offered starting in sixth-grade. The Latin School of Chicago provides its students with a rigorous and innovative educational program in a community that embraces diversity of people, cultures and ideas. Latin inspires its students to pursue their passions and lead lives of purpose and excellence.
