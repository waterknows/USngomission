The Virginia Symphony Orchestra's mission is to inspire, educate, and connect audiences of all ages. We do this by providing world-class musical and educational services for the enrichment, inspiration, and enjoyment of Hampton Roads communities. The vision of the Virginia Symphony Orchestra is to help grow a vibrant community using the arts as a cultural resource, a driver of economic activity, and a partner in education. At the time it was founded in 1920, the Norfolk Symphony was the only American orchestra between Baltimore and Atlanta. In 1979, the Norfolk Symphony merged with the Peninsula Symphony Orchestra and the Virginia Beach Pops Symphony to become the Virginia Symphony Orchestra, which was incorporated on April 10, 1979. Now in its 95th season, the Virginia Symphony Orchestra is Southeastern Virginia's preeminent professional symphony orchestra.
