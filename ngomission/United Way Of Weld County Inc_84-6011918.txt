Founded in 1970, United Way of Weld County works to improve lives by mobilizing the caring power of our community. We exist to improve the lives of people in Weld County. We are a proven method to tackle the community's most pressing concerns. Working together, we can solve problems better than we can alone.

Whether you make a contribution of dollars or time, you help more than one person or charity. You support a network of services that provide children with a good start, invest in the future of youth, help people through crisis, encourage self sufficiency, support the elderly, support health and wellness, and help people overcome disability.
