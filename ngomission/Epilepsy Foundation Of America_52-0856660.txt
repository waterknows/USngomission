Founded in 1968, the Epilepsy Foundation is the national voluntary agency solely dedicated to the welfare of people with epilepsy in the U.S. and their families. The mission of the Epilepsy Foundation is to stop seizures and SUDEP, find a cure and overcome the challenges created by epilepsy through efforts including education, advocacy and research to accelerate ideas into therapies. In addition to programs conducted at the national level, epilepsy clients throughout the United States are served by Epilepsy Foundation affiliates around the country. In December 2012, the Epilepsy Therapy Project was merged into the Epilepsy Foundation
