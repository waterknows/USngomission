Pendle Hill is a center of God's work in transforming the world. Pendle Hill nurtures the life and witness of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) through worship, work, study and service. We welcome those of all spiritual paths. For more than 75 years Pendle Hill has brought together people from around the world and from many religious traditions. At Pendle Hill worship, study, work and service are integrated every day in our curriculum and community life. We offer the rare opportunity to step back from contemporary culture, reflect on our lives and our relationship with the Divine, and prepare for renewed witness in the world.
