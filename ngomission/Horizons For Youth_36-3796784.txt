Horizons for Youth is the only scholarship organization offering comprehensive support services such as tutoring and mentoring to students as early as kindergarten and continuing through high school graduation. With a 99% high school graduation rate and 80% college attendance rate, our program is a proven model for academic achievement and personal growth. We provide children from low-resource areas the opportunity for a quality education and the support services to take full advantage of it. Our participants are Chicago residents with limited income and who have at least one child in grades K-3. We select families after a thorough interview process that confirms a strong foundation at home and a commitment to making the most of education.
