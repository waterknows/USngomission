Community Catalyst, a national advocacy organization, has been giving consumers a voice in health care reform for more than a decade. We provide leadership and support to state and local consumer organizations, policymakers and foundations that are working to guarantee access to high-quality, affordable health care for everyone. Our contributions, which range from policy analysis and strategic assistance to managing national campaigns, enable consumer groups to provide leadership in the hard work of transforming the U.S. health care system. Since 1997, in states and communities across the country, we have been a catalyst for collaboration, innovation, and action in health care reform.
