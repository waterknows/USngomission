Front Range Equine Rescue, established in 1997, is working to prevent the abuse and neglect of horses through rescue and education. The rescue program is at the heart of Front Range's work. Incoming horses with unknown backgrounds are quarantined. Horses are obtained from auctions, kill lots, animal control impound, abandonment cases, and owner surrender. The focus is on abused and neglected horses with emphasis on those bound for slaughter. The educational program consists of a number of annual events including an Equine Education Awareness Day held each May. Annual clinics and seminars are conducted to educate horse enthusiasts on a variety of horse care topics and horse related issues.
