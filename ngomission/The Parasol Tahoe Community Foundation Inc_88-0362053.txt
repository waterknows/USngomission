Parasol Tahoe Community Foundation was founded in 1996 to be a unique foundation that serves the Lake Tahoe community by promoting philanthropy and non-profit collaboration. We exist not to support a single organization, but to address the broadest range of charitable issues by building a perpetual source of community capital. We manage charitable funds for individuals, families, businesses and organizations that turn to us to help fulfill their philanthropic intent. The Parasol Tahoe Community Foundation (PTCF) provides leadership in the Lake Tahoe Basin as an effective, independent arena for addressing difficult issues and advocating for needed programs, services or policies.
