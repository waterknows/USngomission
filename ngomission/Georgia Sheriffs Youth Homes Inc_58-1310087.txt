The Georgia Sheriffs' Youth Homes works to give our state's most at-risk children the love, security, and structure every child needs to become a mature, successful adult. We provide quality care for Georgia's children who, through no fault of their own, may be products of abuse, neglect, and dysfunctional families. We also provide opportunities for boys and girls in care to resolve their personal conflicts, find their identities, and learn proper values as they work toward a lawful, productive and secure future. Georgia Sheriffs' Youth Homes serve over one hundred children in residential care and hundreds of children in its camping program.
