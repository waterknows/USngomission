Clean Water Fund (CWF) works to develop strong grassroots environmental leadership and to bring together diverse constituencies to work cooperatively for changes that improve their lives, focused on health, consumer, environmental and community problems. Since 1978, Clean Water Fund has helped people campaign successfully for cleaner and safer water, cleaner air, and protection from toxic pollution in our homes, neighborhoods and workplaces. Clean Water Fund's programs build on and complement those of Clean Water Action, which has helped develop, pass, strengthen and defend the nation's major water and toxics laws.
