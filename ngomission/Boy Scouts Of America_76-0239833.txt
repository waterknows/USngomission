The Boy Scouts of America, Sam Houston Area Council is dedicated to providing the opportunity for all youth to engage in age appropriate, positive and impactful programs within the 16 counties served in southeast Texas. The mission of the Boy Scouts of America is to prepare young people to make ethical and moral choices over their lifetime by instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Law. The Boy Scouts of America provides youth with programs and activities that allow them to try new things, providing service to others, building self-confidence and reinforcing ethical standards. While team sports programs and many other youth activities teach basic skills and promote teamwork, Scouting goes beyond that - developing character and encouraging youth to achieve a deeper appreciation for service to others in their community.
