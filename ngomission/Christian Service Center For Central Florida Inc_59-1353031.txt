The Christian Service Center for Central Florida is a service agency which, since 1971, has provided the hurting of our community with programs designed to meet physical, emotional, and spiritual needs. Millions have been served regardless of race, religion, financial status, or the nature of their need. In addition to food and clothing, Christian Service Center for Central Florida provides rent and utilities to those in immediate need; gasoline vouchers for transportation to and from a job; travel vouchers for emergency cases; employment counseling and referral; drug and alcohol addiction referrals; phone calls; adult day care programs; after school tutoring; and non-residential mentoring program such as Fresh Start. Our newest program (Love Pantry) addresses food insecurity of children by putting an emergency food supply directly into schools.
