Poets & Writers (P&W) is the primary source of information, support, and guidance for creative writers. Founded in 1970, it is the nation's largest nonprofit literary organization serving poets, fiction writers, and creative nonfiction writers. The mission of P&W is to foster the professional development of poets and writers, to promote communication throughout the U.S. literary community, and to help create an environment in which literature can be appreciated by the widest possible public. P&W's programs introduce writers to the larger literary community and connect them to audiences, making today's writing visible and accessible in major cities and small towns across the country.
