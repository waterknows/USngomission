Moving Traditions inspires people to live fuller lives and to work for a better world for all by advocating for a more expansive view of gender in Jewish learning and practice. Teens in our programs Rosh Hodesh: It's a Girl Thing! and Shevet Achim: The Brotherhood apply a gender lens and Jewish values to the challenges of their everyday lives.
