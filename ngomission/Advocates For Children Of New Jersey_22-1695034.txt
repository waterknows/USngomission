Advocates for Children of New Jersey is the trusted, independent voice putting children's needs first for more than 30 years. We educate the public and policymakers and equip caregivers with the information they need to be their child's strongest ally. Our work results in better laws and policies, more effective funding and stronger services for children and families. This means more children are given the chance to grow up safe, healthy and educated.
