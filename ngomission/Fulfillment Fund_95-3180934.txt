As a college access organization, the Fulfillment Fund is dedicated to making college a reality for students growing up in educationally and economically under-resourced communities. Through classroom instruction, college counseling, mentoring and scholarships, we transform the lives of students, beginning in high school and extending to college graduation. Our impact spans beyond the students we serve directly. They, in turn, influence siblings, peers and their community by becoming role models, volunteers, mentors and donors.
