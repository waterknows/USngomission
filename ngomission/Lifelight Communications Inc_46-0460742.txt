Since 1998 LifeLight Communications has worked to unite churches and ministries together in moving forward with the call that God has given us, and that call is stronger than ever. There are three parts of our calling: reaching, raising, and sending. Sharing the life-changing power of Jesus is at the front of everything we do. Our goal in the years ahead is to expose one million people with a clear presentation of this Good News. Partnering with churches and other ministries, we help disciple teenagers and adults in knowing and living God's word in their daily life. This involves developing student leaders on campus, raising youth pastors, preparing counselors at events, equipping those going on mission trips, and following up on new believers. We send people into their world and into the world to reach people for Christ.
