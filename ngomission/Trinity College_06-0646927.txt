Founded in 1823, Trinity College is an independent, nonsectarian liberal arts college, and is one of the oldest colleges in the country. With an undergraduate student body consisting of 2,018 students, Trinity's key asset is the strength and quality of faculty and student interaction, and has a student-to-teacher ratio of 11:1. Trinity offers 38 majors, including engineering and environmental science, as well as interdisciplinary offerings, with nearly 900 courses to choose from. We are a community united in a quest for excellence in liberal arts education. Our purpose is to foster critical thinking, free the mind of parochialism and prejudice, and prepare students to lead examined lives that are personally satisfying, civically responsible, and socially useful.
