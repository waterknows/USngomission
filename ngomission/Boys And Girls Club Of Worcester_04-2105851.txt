Founded in 1893, the Boys and Girls Club of Worcester works to help youth, especially those who need us most, develop the qualities needed to become responsible citizens and community leaders, through caring professional staff who forge relationships with our youth members and influence their ability to succeed in life. We not only change lives, we save lives. We provide informal education and recreation facilities to youth in the Worcester area.
