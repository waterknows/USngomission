Founded in 1871, the Kentucky United Methodist Homes for Children and Youth has a vision to be a Christ-centered ministry of hope for the healing and wholeness of children and families. They strive to demonstrate God's creating and renewing roles in this world by recognizing the unique value and worth of each person, offering a continuum of services to meet the unique and changing needs of children and families, emphasizing the positive benefits of reconciliation and restitution in all persons, treating each person with respect, being an agency of the United Methodist Church and forming partnerships with the state of Kentucky and other appropriate agencies and institutions to serve children and families.
