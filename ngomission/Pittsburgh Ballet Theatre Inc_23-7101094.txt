Founded in December of 1969, Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre (PBT) has toured extensively throughout its history to 28 states, Canada, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic, with a repertoire rich in classics, and works by contemporary choreographers. PBT's Ballet School features a unique program for its high school age students in collaboration with Pittsburgh's Schenley High School, which offers an opportunity for education concurrent with rigorous professional ballet training. An understanding of PBT's impact on the community has led to comprehensive program of Arts Education and Community Engagement initiatives that deepen the experience in the arts for many who would not otherwise be exposed to the performing arts.
