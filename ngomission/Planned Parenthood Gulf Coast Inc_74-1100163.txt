Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast is a provider of reproductive health care, sexuality education and advocacy for reproductive rights. For just over five years, our Louisiana and our Houston and Southeast Texas affiliates have been working as one team but we held on to our different names. Our name change to Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast reflects our unity, and the incredible care every staff person provides to women and men in need across the 418 miles of the Gulf Coast region from Bryan to New Orleans. We work to ensure that all women, men and teens have access to safe, affordable health care and accurate information. With a network of twelve health centers in Houston, Southeast Texas and Louisiana we help people get the health care they need so they can live and love the way they want to.
