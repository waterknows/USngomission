The Fund for Park Avenue is one of the earliest examples of a public-private partnership working to improve and beautify New York City's public spaces. Because of the contributions received annually from the community, The Fund for Park Avenue has been able to consistently fulfill its mission of planting and maintaining the trees and flowers on the Park Avenue malls since it was founded in 1980.
