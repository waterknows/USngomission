Out & Equal Workplace Advocates educates and empowers organizations, human resources professionals, employee resource groups, and individual employees through programs and services that result in equal policies, opportunities, practices, and benefits in the workplace inclusive of all sexual orientations, gender identities, expressions, and characteristics. We believe that people should be judged by the work they do, not by their sexual orientation or gender identity. Every day, we work to protect and empower employees to be productive and successful so they can support themselves, their families, and contribute to achieving a world free of discrimination for everyone.
