Heritage for the Blind provides free, practical, hands-on information to enhance quality of life and independence for adults with vision loss, their families and friends, caregivers, and vision professionals. Our goal is to provide useful techniques that can help adults cope with vision changes, adapt everyday tasks, keep their jobs, enjoy their hobbies, and retain their independence.
