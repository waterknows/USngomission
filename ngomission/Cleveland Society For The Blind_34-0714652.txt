Cleveland Sight Center is a multi-faceted agency founded in 1906 serving people of all ages who are blind or visually impaired. We provide preventative, educational, rehabilitative, and many other vision support services directly to approximately 10,000 clients in the greater Cleveland area each year. Through community outreach and our radio-reading service, that number increases significantly. In addition to our educational and rehabilitative programs, we have a Low Vision Clinic, offer a wide array of social and recreational activities, and have a residential camp, Highbrook Lodge, in Chardon. Our comprehensive services are available to residents of Cuyahoga, Lake, and Geauga counties, with onsite services available to anyone who can travel to Cleveland Sight Center's University Circle location.
