Founded in 1991, Rainbow Village works to transform lives for homeless families with children of North Metro Atlanta through a community based transitional housing program that promotes self-sufficiency. Our program invites families to move into a complete furnished home for one to two years. Upon entry into the Rainbow Village program, families are assessed in terms of financial status and available resources, career development, education attainment, life skills, available support systems, and mental/physical health, all of which are used to establish a baseline from which to create a realistic plan for achieving self-sufficiency. The end-goal is the same for all families, the ability to lead healthy and sustainable lifestyles on their own.
