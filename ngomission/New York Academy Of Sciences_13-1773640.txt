Since 1817, the New York Academy of Sciences has had a three-pronged mission: to advance scientific knowledge, to help resolve major global challenges facing society with science-based solutions, and to increase the number of scientifically informed individuals. One way the Academy accomplishes this is by convening - in New York and throughout the world - leading and, especially, emerging experts in scores of meetings, seminars, and interdisciplinary conferences annually. To drive scientific progress, the Academy disseminates the speakers' insights through both print and innovative electronic media including the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, Academy electronic briefings, and the Science & the City Podcast. The Academy also convenes the foremost authorities in science, technology, innovation and sustainability to help inform policymakers.
