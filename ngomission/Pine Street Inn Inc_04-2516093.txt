Pine Street Inn works to be a community of respect and hope for each guest it serves; to be a resource through which neighbors and friends can help to meet the basic needs of others; and to serve as a national leader in the fight to end homelessness. Our services include permanent supportive housing, emergency and transitional shelter, over 3,000 prepared meals served each day, street outreach, job training, and mental health support and substance abuse treatment. Founded in 1969, Pine Street Inn serves more than 1,300 homeless individuals daily and 10,000 annually, providing the full spectrum of services to help men and women reach their highest level of independence and get back to a place they can call home.
