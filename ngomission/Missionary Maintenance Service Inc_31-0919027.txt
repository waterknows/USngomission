MMS Aviation prepares aircraft for missions while training aircraft mechanics for mission service. Since 1975, MMS has provided an aircraft maintenance apprenticeship for those who wish to serve God through mission aviation. MMS also provides aircraft repair, overhaul and modification free of any labor charge to Christian missionary organizations. We want every thing we do to help people come to know Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. To do that, God has called MMS Aviation to serve.
