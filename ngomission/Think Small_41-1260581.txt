Think Small's mission is to advance quality care and education of children in their crucial early years. We remain as dedicated to our mission now as we have always been-and to the principles that gave rise to our organization in 1971: That the quality of a child's early experiences greatly influences his or her success later in life.

That there is much that can be done to improve the quality of early childhood settings to optimize a child's development.
