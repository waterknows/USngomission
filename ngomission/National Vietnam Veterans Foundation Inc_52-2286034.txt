The National Vietnam Veterans Foundation was created by veterans on behalf of veterans. We are a national organization dedicated to aiding, supporting and benefiting America's veterans and their families. Veterans helping veterans with the generous support of the American people is our mission. The Foundation is guided and directed by a board made up entirely of veterans who have served in a combat zone. Our mission is to raise the level of public pride in the achievement of Vietnam Veterans; provide educational seminars, workshops, conferences, and training programs; and sponsor scholarships for the education of dependent children of Vietnam Veterans.
