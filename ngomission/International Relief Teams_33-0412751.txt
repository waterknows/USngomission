International Relief Teams (IRT) alleviates human suffering by providing health services and humanitarian assistance to victims of disaster, neglect, and profound poverty worldwide. Since 1988, IRT has provided $6.5 million in volunteer services and $308 million in medicines and supplies to families in desperate need in 68 countries worldwide. IRT focuses on two core activities: 1) disaster relief and 2) building healthy communities. During disasters, IRT chooses appropriate responses to leverage donor resources to their highest effectiveness, including deploying medical and reconstruction teams, providing relief supplies, or financing the restoration of livelihoods and infrastructure. IRT builds healthy communities by providing a) medical training to save babies' lives, b) surgeries for the forgotten poor, c) eye glasses to improve sight, d) medicines for rural hospitals and clinics, e) nutrition and education support for abused, abandoned and homeless children.
