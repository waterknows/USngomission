Kimberly Home is a non-denominational pregnancy resource center that offers assistance to women in unplanned or troubling pregnancies. Opened in 1983, we provide a host of services including counseling, material assistance, infant and toddler daycare, and transitional housing as well as referrals to the resources throughout the community. For 25 years, we have been assisting women in making healthy and positive choices for themselves and their babies. All of our services are provided on a confidential basis.
