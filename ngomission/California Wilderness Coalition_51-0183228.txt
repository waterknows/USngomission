The California Wilderness Coalition (CWC) protects the natural landscapes that make California unique, providing clean air and water, a home to wildlife, and a place for recreation and spiritual renewal. CWC is the only organization dedicated to protecting and restoring California's wild places and native biodiversity on a statewide level. Since 1976, we have empowered local communities and conservationists to be the voice for wild California. Our work focuses on federal legislation to secure wilderness designation for wilderness quality lands, lakes, and rivers in California. We also monitor and respond to changes in management policy, administrative directives, planning, or legislation at federal or state level that impacts wilderness areas. We work to secure federal wilderness designation, build diverse constituencies to protect the desert.
