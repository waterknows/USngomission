Created in 1943, the American Architectural Foundation (AAF) seeks to educate individuals and community leaders about the power of architecture to improve lives and transform the places where we live, learn, work, and play. Through numerous outreach programs, grants, and educational resources, AAF aims to inspire people to become thoughtful and engaged stewards of the world around them. AAF's programs include The Mayors' Institute on City Design and Great Schools by Design--highly regarded initiatives that help improve the built environment through the collaboration of thought leaders, designers, and local communities.
