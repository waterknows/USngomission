Founded in 2001 by the parents of a child with cancer, Flashes of Hope is a volunteer driven organization solely focused on children's cancer. Flashes of Hope's mission is to raise funds to accelerate a cure for children's cancer while honoring the unique life and memories of every child fighting cancer. With chapters in 55 cities, Flashes of Hope photographs more than 50% of the children annually diagnosed in the United States. In 2009, Flashes of Hope began funding research and has already raised millions of dollars through the Kick-program and other initiatives.
