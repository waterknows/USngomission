Interfaith Ministries for Greater Houston (IM) brings people of diverse faith traditions together for dialogue, collaboration and service, as a demonstration of our shared beliefs. IM provides four main services: Meals on Wheels for Greater Houston which delivers more than one million meals each year to seniors in Harris county; Refugee Services which, in conjunction with the U.S. State Department, resettles hundreds of refugees in Houston each year; Office of Disaster Preparedness and Response (ODPR) which facilitates communication on behalf of Houston's faith communities during relief and recovery efforts and; Interfaith Relations which provides a safe harbor for Greater Houston through its many interfaith programs and dialogue efforts.
