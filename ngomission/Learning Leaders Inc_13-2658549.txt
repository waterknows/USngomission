Founded in 1956 as the New York City School Volunteer Program, Learning Leaders was the first program of its kind in the country and served as a model for developing school volunteer programs in other major cities. Learning Leaders has grown to become the largest school volunteer and parent engagement program in the city and a valued partner of the New York City Department of Education. Learning Leaders has helped students succeed by providing individualized instructional support through the implementation of the Fundamental Program, essentially the one-on-one tutoring model. This program establishes volunteers to assist with reading, writing, ESL, math and other academic activities. Learning Leaders recruits, trains and supports up to 10,000 school volunteers who work with over 230,000 students.
