Established in 1982, Second Harvest Food Bank of East Tennessee works to eliminate hunger in our 18 county service area by providing food, services and education to address the nutritional needs of all people at-risk of hunger. Second Harvest distributes food to roughly 140,000 hungry people every month through a network of partner agencies throughout East Tennessee. Agencies are non-profit organizations dedicated to feeding the hungry and include church pantries, shelters, group homes, local kitchens, after-school program sites, rehabilitation centers and many others.
