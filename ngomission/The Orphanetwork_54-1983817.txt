ORPHANetwork equips vulnerable and orphaned children to fully realize their God-given potential. We work through local church partners in Nicaragua to accomplish each of our four missional targets: to rescue abandoned, abused, and orphaned children, to prevent vulnerable children from becoming abandoned, to create opportunities for new life, and to share Christ with everyone.
