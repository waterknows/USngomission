The University of Chicago was founded in 1890 by the American Baptist Education Society and oil magnate John D. Rockefeller. The University of Chicago has had a profound impact on American higher education; curricula across the country have been influenced by the emphasis on broad humanistic and scientific undergraduate education. The University enrolls approximately 4,900 undergraduates and 9,820 graduate, professional and other students. In addition to the undergraduate College, the four graduate divisions, and the six professional schools, there are libraries, laboratories, museums, clinics, and other institutions; nursery and K-12 schools; a continuing-studies program; and an academic press.
