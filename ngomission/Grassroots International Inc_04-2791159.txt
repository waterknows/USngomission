Grassroots International works to create a just and sustainable world by building alliances with progressive movements. We provide grants to our Global South partners and join them in advocating for social change. Our primary focus is on land, water and food as human rights and nourishing the political struggle necessary to achieve these rights. Grassroots is a human rights and international development organization that supports community-led sustainable development projects. Since 1983 we have worked in the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and the Americas, concentrating our efforts in areas where U.S. foreign policy has been an obstacle to positive change and where creative grassroots movements build local solutions to global problems.
