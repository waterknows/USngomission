United Way of the Greater Triangle was born out of the consolidation of the United Ways of Durham, Orange and Wake counties in 1996 and the addition of Johnston County in 2009. The mission of the United Way of the Greater Triangle is to improve lives by mobilizing the caring power of communities. Last year we touched the lives of 300,000 people in need across Durham, Johnston, Orange and Wake counties. Our priorities are health, education, income and safety. Regional initiatives include financial stability and ending homelessness.
