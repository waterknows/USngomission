Founded in 1999, Green Dot Public Schools is the leading public schools operator in Los Angeles and an important catalyst for education reform, locally and nationally. Its mission is to transform public education in Los Angeles so that all young adults receive the education they deserve to be prepared for college, leadership, and life. Green Dot's work is directly focused on influencing Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) to transform its failing secondary schools and helping the district reinvent itself as one of the best school districts in the country. We do this by operating our schools sustainably on public funds and with an independent and progressive teachers' union. Green Dot operates 18 successful charter high and middle schools in the highest need areas of Los Angeles, almost half of which are whole school turnarounds of what were formerly the three lowest performing schools in Los Angeles - Locke High School, Jordan High School, and Henry Clay Middle School.
