URI is a global network of over 500 grassroots organizations, called Cooperation Circles, dedicated to peace and justice through interfaith and cross-cultural cooperation. Our nearly half a million members are overcoming distrust and hostility every day for the good of their communities-mediating religiously motivated conflict; building schools, orphanages and health clinics; campaigning for citizenship rights and more in 78 countries. Through our San Francisco headquarters and eight regional offices, URI provides a framework for local, regional and global organizing and action; access to resources and support; and an international network and brand that empowers, connects and amplifies the work of our members worldwide.
