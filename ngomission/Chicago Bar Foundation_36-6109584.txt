The Chicago Bar Foundation (CBF) mobilizes our legal community around a cause that is a distinctive responsibility of our profession: ensuring that everyone in the Chicago metropolitan area has equal access to justice, particularly the low-income and disadvantaged people who are in most critical need of the protections of the legal system. Through grants, advocacy, pro bono and partnerships, the CBF takes a system-wide approach to improving access to justice and focuses on those objectives that are best achieved by the legal community working together.
