Planned Parenthood Southeast works to ensure that every child is a wanted child and to protect reproductive health by providing comprehensive, medically-accurate sex education and quality health care, while advocating for the reproductive rights of women, men and families. The Atlanta, Georgia affiliate of Planned Parenthood began in 1964. In 1930, a Planned Parenthood affiliate was created in Birmingham, Alabama, the oldest in the Southeast. Services were added in Mississippi in 1989 and all three states joined forces in 2010 under the name Planned Parenthood Southeast.
