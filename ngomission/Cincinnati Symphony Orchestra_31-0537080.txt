Embarking on its 117th year, the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra (CSO) is a dynamic ensemble of world-class musicians, conductors and guest artists. Founded in 1895, the CSO proudly serves the Greater Cincinnati community as the fifth oldest orchestra in the United States and the first orchestra in the state of Ohio. The CSO is no stranger to the national spotlight, as it became the third orchestra to professionally record in 1917 and the first orchestra to be broadcast to a national radio audience in 1921. These early achievements have paved the way for the CSO's continued longevity and success. Innovative programming featuring world-renowned artists, national and international tours, as well as countless awards and recordings have placed the CSO as one of the world's most acclaimed and recognized symphony orchestras.
