Founded in 1971, the Christian Relief Fund (CRF) is dedicated to following Christ's example of ministering to human needs spiritually, physically, and emotionally, by feeding the hungry, healing disease and heartbreak, fighting ignorance and poverty through education and preaching the Gospel through word and deed. Since its founding, CRF has grown to provide child sponsorship, family sponsorship, and operate children's homes and schools in third-world countries. CRF sponsorship programs and homes provide food, clothes, medical care, schooling, and Bible teaching in 33 countries. Currently nearly 5,200 children are being sponsored in our programs.
