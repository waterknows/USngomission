Marine Toys for Tots Foundation (MTFTF) is the fund raising, funding and support organization for the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve Toys for Tots Program. From 1991 - 2012, the Foundation supplemented local toy collections with over 102 million toys valued at $750 million. Concurrently, the Foundation provided over $10.5 million worth of promotion and support materials, which enable local Toys for Tots Coordinators to conduct more effective local campaigns. The primary goal of the Foundation is the same as that of the overall Toys for Tots program: to deliver, through a shiny new toy at Christmas, a message of hope to needy youngsters that will motivate them to grow into responsible, productive, patriotic citizens and community leaders.
