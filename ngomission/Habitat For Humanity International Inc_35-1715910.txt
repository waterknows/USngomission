Habitat for Humanity of Greater Indianapolis is an ecumenical Christian ministry that envisions greater Indianapolis as a place where every resident has access to quality and affordable homeownership opportunities. We seek to build self-sufficiency for residents in need through the life-changing opportunity of homeownership. We want to see vibrant neighborhoods where engaged homeowners participate in building safe and healthy communities.
