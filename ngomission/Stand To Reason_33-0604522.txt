Founded in 1993, Stand to Reason (STR) equips Christian ambassadors with knowledge, wisdom, and character. STR trains Christians to think more clearly about their faith and to make an even-handed, incisive, yet gracious defense for classical Christianity and classical Christian values in the public square. We focus on the basics, the fundamentals of theology and ethics, and the fundamental tools of thought. STR teaches the value of using our minds to love God and share the Gospel. We encourage Christians to develop coherent answers to questions that challenge Christianity so that their faith is deepened and thereby are emboldened to share the Gospel. STR develops religious educational materials such as audio tapes and written commentaries for Christians.
