Nicky Cruz Outreach (NCO) targets urban environments in order to reach out to those who are most frequently trapped by destructive lifestyles and who are caught in a downward spiral of intense violence, drug abuse and gang activity. The goal is two-fold: first, introduce them to a fundamental and permanent spiritual change by presenting to them the only real solution: Jesus Christ; second, invest in their leadership development, equipping them to live healthy, productive lives, and training them to go back into their worlds to reach others for Christ.
