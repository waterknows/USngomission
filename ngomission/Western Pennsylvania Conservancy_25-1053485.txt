The Western Pennsylvania Conservancy (WPC) protects and restores exceptional places to provide our region with clean waters and healthy forests, wildlife and natural areas for the benefit of present and future generations. The Conservancy creates green spaces and gardens, contributing to the vitality of our cities and towns, and preserves Fallingwater, a symbol of people living in harmony with nature. Pennsylvania's first conservancy, WPC has protected nearly 225,000 acres of natural lands in Pennsylvania since it was established in 1932. WPC has restored watersheds around the state and saved numerous natural habitats to preserve Pennsylvania's rich diversity of life.
