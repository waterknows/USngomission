The mission of Cancer Support Community North Texas is to ensure that all people impacted by cancer are empowered by knowledge, strengthened by action, and sustained by community. Completely free of charge and nonprofit, Cancer Support Community offers support groups, networking groups, lectures, workshops and social events in a non-residential, home-like setting. Cancer Support Community is a place where people with cancer and their families and friends learn to live with cancer, and hopefully beyond it. It is their lifeline to strength, hope and guidance. The effects are often life-changing.
