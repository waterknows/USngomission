Established in 1970, The Peregrine Fund works nationally and internationally to conserve birds of prey in nature. We conserve nature by achieving results - results restoring species in jeopardy, conserving habitat, educating students, training conservationists, providing factual information to the public, and by accomplishing good science. We succeed through cooperation and hard-work, using common sense, being hands-on and non-political, and by emphasizing solutions. At our world headquarters, the World Center for Birds of Prey in Boise, Idaho, we propagate birds of prey for release to the wild and house about 200 falcons and condors for breeding.
