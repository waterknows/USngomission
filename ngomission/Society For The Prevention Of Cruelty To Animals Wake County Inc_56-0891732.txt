Founded in Raleigh in 1967, the SPCA (Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) of Wake County is dedicated to creating a more humane community where every adoptable animal has a home. Each year the SPCA rehomes over 3,000 animals through its innovative adoption programs and lost and found efforts. The SPCA's mission is to protect, shelter and promote the adoption of homeless animals; to provide education about responsible pet ownership and to reduce pet overpopulation through spay/neuter programs. The SPCA of Wake County operates two animal shelters: the Curtis Dail Pet Adoption Center focuses on pet adoption and public education, and the Holding Center located in Garner. This facility is used to shelter animals waiting for space at the Curtis Dail Pet Adoption Center. The SPCA also operates the Saving Lives Spay/Neuter Clinic, providing low-cost surgeries to the general public. In July 2010, the SPCA became a no-kill agency working towards a no-kill community.
