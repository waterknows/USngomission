Liberty Science Center (LSC) is dedicated to offering exceptional science learning experiences onsite, offsite and online. Located in Liberty State Park, Jersey City, NJ, we engage learners of all ages in science excitement, provide professional development for teachers, and actively connect people of all backgrounds to pivotal science and society issues. First opened in 1993, LSC engages diverse audiences in relevant issues that connect nature, humanity and technology. Through innovative and meaningful experiences, we inspire action to strengthen communities and advance global stewardship. LSC re-opened in July 2007 after a nearly two-year, $109 million renovation with all-new exhibitions, a 20,000 square-foot center devoted to science learning and teaching, and a focus on making a difference in society - and inspiring others to do the same.
