Since 1858, the YMCA of Metropolitan Chicago has contributed to the lives of girls, boys, women and men of all ages, races, religions and economic backgrounds. Whether teaching children to swim, rescuing young men from gangs, training adults for the workforce, providing expectant mothers with prenatal care or serving transients with housing and supportive care, YMCAs collaborate with public service providers, government agencies, churches and neighborhood associations to improve life quality and encourage individual achievement. The YMCA of Metropolitan Chicago operates 21 fitness centers, four resident camps, seven human service centers, five single room housing residences, four senior housing centers, and one supportive housing for young adult males.
