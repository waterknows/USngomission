Shake-A-Leg Miami is South Florida's premier adaptive water sports community that serves people of all abilities.

With many programs offered seven days a week, Shake-A-Leg Miami provides many opportunities for children, youth and adults with or without physical challenges to experience beautiful Biscayne Bay. We use the marine environment to improve the health, education and independence of people with disabilities, disadvantaged youth and their families in an inclusive setting.
