The mission of Fun Time is to provide safe, quality, affordable education and care for children of low-income working families and to prepare the children for kindergarten, ready to read and ready to learn. Fun Time provides a comprehensive early childhood learning environment. It is guided by The Florida School Readiness Performance Standards and Head Start Performance Standards. The children are taught by teachers with early childhood education and credentialed staff members. The research-based Creative Curriculum provides a framework and a focus on the interest areas in all classrooms as well as supporting the teachers in providing an emergent curriculum. Fun Time offers an academic content in the curriculum for all children 2-5 years old while recognizing the importance that children learn through play.
