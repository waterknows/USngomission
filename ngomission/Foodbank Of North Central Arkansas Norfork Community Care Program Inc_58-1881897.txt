The Food Bank of North Central Arkansas obtains, processes, warehouses and distributes food, supplies and donated items to approximately 90 agencies across our nine county service area. Our mission of "Building Bridges from Hunger to Hope" goes beyond our core of feeding the hungry, to providing educational tools and connecting individuals, churches, schools, and civic organizations in our service area in the common goal of "Create Communities without Hunger." We understand that we can accomplish much more together than we could ever accomplish on our own. That is why part of our mission focuses on making these connections. We believe a community working together can solve its problems.
