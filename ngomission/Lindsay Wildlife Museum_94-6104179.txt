Lindsay Wildlife Museum is a unique natural history and environmental education center where live, wild animals are just inches away. Visitors can listen to the cry of a red tailed hawk, go eye-to-eye with a gray fox and watch a bald eagle eat lunch. More than 50 species of live, non-releasable, native California animals are on exhibit. Founded in 1955, the museum's programs connect people with wildlife to inspire responsibility and respect for the world we share. The museum houses a hands-on discovery room for children, a pet education section with small domestic animals and changing natural history and art exhibits. The on-site wildlife rehabilitation center is one of the oldest and largest wildlife hospitals in the United States, treating nearly 6,000 injured or orphaned wild animals each year.
