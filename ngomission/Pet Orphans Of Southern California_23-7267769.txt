Since its founding in 1973, Pet Orphans of Southern California (POSC) has been dedicated to combating the national crisis of overpopulation, abandonment and euthanasia through extensive education programs. While focusing on the universal concern, POSC is committed to serving its community by rescuing and rehabilitating homeless dogs and cats, providing them with exceptional care and then carefully matching them with suitable adoptive families. In addition to education and rescue, POSC provides broad community support by offering a wide range of services including medical/financial, spay/neuter and training assistance, encouraging responsible pet guardianship thus reducing abandonment and other consequences that deepen the national crisis.
