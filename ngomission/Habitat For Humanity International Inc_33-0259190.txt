Founded in 1988, San Diego Habitat for Humanity (SDHFH) is the local affiliate of Habitat for Humanity International and serves San Diego County. Seeking to put God's love into action, SDHFH brings people together to build homes, communities, and hope. Habitat was founded on the conviction that every man, woman and child should have a simple, decent and affordable home to live in dignity and safety. Habitat builds homes for ownership by low-income families in need. Habitat homes are sold to Partner Families and are financed by a 0%-interest 25 to 30-year mortgage. The mortgage payments create a revolving fund that Habitat uses to construct future homes for local families in need. Families qualify for the program by showing a demonstrated need for improved housing, a willingness to partner with Habitat by committing to 250-500 hours of "sweat equity" helping to build their own home, and the ability to repay the 0%-interest, 25 to 30-year mortgage.
