The mission of Urban Homeworks is to perpetuate the hope of Jesus Christ through innovative community development that produces dignified housing for low-income families, a strategic network of good neighbors and the redemptive development of real estate. Since 1995, Urban Homeworks has been responding to the voices of our neighbors by providing dignified housing opportunities, creating space for construction training, intentionally weaving together a network of engaged neighbors, and mobilizing volunteers. Our focus on stability and connecting resources so that individual and communal assets emerge, thrive, and invigorate our neighborhoods has resulted in more than 200 redeveloped properties and a network of 17,000 volunteers, 1,200 construction trainees, and over 400 Urban Neighbors.
