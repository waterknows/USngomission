The Louisiana Children's Museum promotes hands-on participatory learning for children of all ages. Encouraging discovery through observation, inquiry, creative construction, role-playing, problem-solving and free play, the Museum motivates children to develop their cognitive, physical and social skills while enjoying fruitful interaction with adults and peers. Since opening its doors in 1986, the Louisiana Children's Museum has been one of the city's premier attractions for children. We welcome 147,000 visitors per year, engaging children, families, caregivers, and school groups in memorable interactive experiences designed to make learning fun.
