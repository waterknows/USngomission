Since 1983, Dollar Energy Fund has been working to meet our mission to improve the quality of life for households experiencing hardships by providing utility assistance and other services that lead to self-sufficiency. Dollar Energy Fund has grown to become the fourth largest fuel fund in the country. Our organization has been there for those who need help with their utility bills and the need is growing due to increased costs of everyday living expenses and severe winters. Our unique program model allows us to leverage the generosity of the community to maximize the support from the utility companies and their customers.
