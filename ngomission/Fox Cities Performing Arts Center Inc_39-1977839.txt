The mission of the Fox Cities Performing Arts Center is to serve as a gathering place for the community to engage in educational opportunities and enhance understanding and enjoyment of life through the creation and presentation of the arts. We will do this by providing a premier venue for performing arts attractions and a dynamic environment for our arts organizations. The Performing Arts Center opened its doors to the public on November 25, 2002 in Appleton, Wisconsin to rave reviews. The Center houses the 2,100-seat Thrivent Financial Hall and the smaller, multi-purpose Kimberly-Clark Theater. Additionally, the Center is dedicated to helping educators expand their classrooms and bring the influential power of the arts to their students.
