The Food Bank of the Golden Crescent advocates for a hunger-free Texas. We are committed to working together with other food banks and non-profit organizations to provide a single, trusted and credible voice to the challenge of ending hunger in Texas. We are agents of change and move with urgency on behalf of Texas' most vulnerable citizens. We are collectively committed to treating all people in need with respect and dignity. We view hunger as impacting all communities and counties in Texas and seek solutions to local challenges.
