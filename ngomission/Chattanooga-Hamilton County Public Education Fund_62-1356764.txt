At Public Education Foundation (PEF), we believe there's nothing more important to our community's future than strengthening our public schools. For almost twenty-five years, PEF has provided training, research and resources to teachers, principals and schools in Hamilton County and surrounding areas. Our initiatives give each student access to quality teachers and leaders and, in particular, provide support for reading and writing. Our mission is simple: we want to increase student achievement so all students succeed in learning and in life.
