Hope & Heroes Children's Cancer Fund's mission is to support and expand existing therapies at the Herbert Irving Child & Adolescent Oncology Center at Columbia University Medical Center, located at New York-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital in New York City. In addition, we support the development of new initiatives and enhance the research that is vital to continuing to fight against pediatric cancer.
