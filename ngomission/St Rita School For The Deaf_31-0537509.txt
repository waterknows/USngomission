Founded in 1915, St. Rita School for the Deaf is a Catholic day/residential program whose primary mission is to educate infants and students who need special methods of communication and technological support. We are committed to providing a safe, value-oriented environment which facilitates the educational, social and spiritual development of each student. We offer programs for children from birth to three years old, a Montessori preschool, elementary through high school classes, and a vocational school. Classes provide training in literacy as well as technology, and students can participate in a diverse after school activities program.
