The Make-A-Wish Foundation of North Texas works to grant the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions, in order to enrich the human experience with hope, strength and joy. We want to provide children with the hope for better times, the strength for the tough times and the joy to experience the present. The Make-A-Wish Foundation of North Texas has granted more than 7,000 wishes since our inception in 1982. Our goal is to be a unique part of the treatment process. With doctors providing the medicine, and the Make-A-Wish Foundation supplying the magic, we strive to create miracles in the lives of some very special children.
