The Paleontological Research Institution serves society by increasing and disseminating knowledge about the history of life on Earth. Founded in 1932, PRI has outstanding programs in research, collections, publications, and public education. The Institution cares for a collection of nearly three million specimens (one of the 10 largest in the U.S.). PRI is a national leader in the development of informal (i.e., outside the classroom) Earth science education resources for educators and the general public. PRI's Museum of the Earth was established in 2003 to provide the public an opportunity to explore our world through a mix of natural history displays, interactive science features, and art exhibitions. In 2013, the Cayuga Nature Center became PRI's newest public venue for education. The Nature Center cultivates an appreciation and responsibility for the natural world through outdoor and environmental education and the goal is to create a premier educational center for teaching and learning about the impact of climate change. PRI is separate from, but formally affiliated with Cornell University, and interact closely with numerous University departments in research, teaching, and public outreach.
