The Center for Courageous Kids uplifts children who have chronic or life-threatening illnesses by creating experiences year-round that are memorable, exciting, fun, build self-esteem, are physically safe and medically sound. We have nine separate week-long summer camps where we can serve up to 128 children per week. We also have at least 30 Family Retreats during the year with each Retreat serving up to 30 families. The Family Retreats allow the child and their family to attend camp for an entire weekend. Each week of summer camp and family retreat is designated for a specific illness or disability. We never charge any child or family who attends camp.
