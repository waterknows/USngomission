Incorporated in 1954, SAGE Eldercare is concerned with the health, happiness and general welfare of older citizens and their families. SAGE is distinguished among eldercare agencies with being both the oldest eldercare agency in New Jersey and one of the few not-for-profit eldercare agencies in the United States that offers a comprehensive array of services under one roof. SAGE has been a pioneer in providing community-based care for the elderly. SAGE started one of New Jersey's first Meals-on-Wheels programs in 1966 and opened one of New Jersey's first adult day care programs in 1975. SAGE offers eleven programs and serves 5,000 elders and their families annually in Union, Morris, Somerset and Essex Counties.
