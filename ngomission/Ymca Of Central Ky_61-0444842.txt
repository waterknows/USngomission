Founded in 1853, the YMCA of Central Kentucky strives to put Christian principles into practice through programs that build healthy spirit, mind and body for all. The Y is a powerful association of men, women and children joined together by a shared commitment to nurturing the potential of kids, promoting healthy living and fostering a sense of social responsibility. We believe that lasting personal and social change can only come about when we work together to invest in our kids, our health and our neighbors. That's why, at the Y, strengthening community is our cause. Every day, we work side-by-side with our neighbors in our communities to make sure that everyone, regardless of age, income or background, has the opportunity to learn, grow and thrive.
