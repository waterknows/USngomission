Founded in 1987, in cooperation with the Issaquah School District, the Issaquah Schools Foundation drives resources to help all students achieve the promise of their academic potential. We strive to be the unifying organization that enables the Issaquah School District to provide access to exceptional opportunities district-wide that ignite learning, improve educational outcomes and prepare all students to be confident, competent and engaged citizens.
