The mission of Big Brothers Big Sisters of Greater Pittsburgh is to make positive differences in the lives of children by providing one-to-one mentoring programs and related services that help youth discover their highest potential and grow to become responsible adults leading productive and rewarding lives. The Big Brothers Big Sisters program is all about preventing problems among youth by getting to kids early, before destructive behaviors can take root. When a positive, supportive mentor- someone with a different background and perspectives- gets involved in a child's life, the child often discovers a potential they didn't know they had. And the child always feels better knowing that someone cares for them.
