MiNDTV is the newest initiative of Independence Media, the non-profit organization which owns and operates WYBE Channel 35 in Philadelphia, PA. In 1990, WYBE debuted as one of the nation's only independent public TV stations. WYBE has served its community with international news, documentaries, and unique programs on diverse topics. In 2005, Independence Media started developing MiND, a new multi-platform television and internet channel. Deeply rooted in WYBE's local and global community orientation, MiND emphasizes learning, social awareness, and a hands-on approach to media. MiND's schedule is filled with five minute programs, half of them are made by MiND members. By providing access to individuals, non-profit organizations, and businesses, MiND is reinventing television. We reach nearly six million people every day.
