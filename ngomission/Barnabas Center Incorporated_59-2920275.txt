Founded in 1986 Barnabas Center provides qualifying residents of Nassau County with assistance during a crisis. This assistance includes food, subsidies that cover rent and utilities, and vouchers to our New to You resale store for clothing and household goods. We operate the largest food pantry in Nassau County, and offer nutrition education and cooking classes. Barnabas Center also offers medical and dental services to adult residents of Nassau County. Services include primary, preventative, and behavioral healthcare. Clients and patients qualify for services at 200% or below the Federal Poverty Level income guidelines. Our strategic plan includes helping people beyond their crisis through case management and programs that are focused to return clients to self-sufficiency with hope and happiness in their future. Our community partnerships have resulted in an improvement of service delivery, minimizing duplicate services and maximizing resources.
