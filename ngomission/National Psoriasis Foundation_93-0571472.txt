From its origins in a tiny newspaper classified ad in 1966, the National Psoriasis Foundation has grown to be the largest psoriasis patient advocacy organization in the world. In over 40 years, the Foundation has grown from a small group of volunteers interested in support to a national nonprofit organization that lobbies on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., and offers extensive programs and services, providing help to more than a million people each year. The National Psoriasis Foundation is the voice for millions of Americans who are affected by psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Our mission is to find a cure for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis and to eliminate their devastating effects through research, advocacy and education.
