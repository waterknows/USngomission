Boy Scouts of America Blue Ridge Council prepares young people to make ethical choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Law. The Blue Ridge Council serves eight counties in the Upstate of South Carolina. In the future, Scouting will continue to: offer young people responsible fun and adventure; instill in young people lifetime values and develop in them ethical character as expressed in the Scout Oath and Law; and train young people in citizenship, service, and leadership.
