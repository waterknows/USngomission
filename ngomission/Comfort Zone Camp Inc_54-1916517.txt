Comfort Zone provides grieving children with a voice, a place and a community in which to heal, grow and lead more fulfilling lives. Comfort Zone Camp is a bereavement camp that transforms the lives of children who have experienced the death of a parent, sibling, or primary caregiver. The free camps include confidence building programs and age-based support groups that break the emotional isolation grief often brings. Comfort Zone Camps are offered to children 7-17, and are held year-round in California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Virginia. Comfort Zone plans to expand to Texas in 2011.
