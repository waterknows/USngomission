For over 30 years, Barnabas Foundation has been advancing God's kingdom by providing quality planned giving and estate planning services. The goal is to help caring Christians strengthen support for the ministries of almost 200 member organizations. With that goal in mind, Barnabas also offers a stewardship education and development program for churches, known as a FirstFruits. These programs serve as catalysts for churches to grow good stewards, based upon God's ownership of all gifts.
