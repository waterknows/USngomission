The Salina Rescue Mission is a faith-based, nondenominational facility changing lives one at a time. Our ambition is to give more than the basic needs by providing Christian ministry to persons in need of food, shelter, clothing, or other basic needs, and to rehabilitate through teaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The Salina Rescue Mission has responded to homeless men and countless others for over 20 years. The number of beds have more than doubled since the ministry was founded in 1981. Over 50,000 meals are served yearly.
