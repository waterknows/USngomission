Serving Nebraska since 1973, the Nebraska Humanities Council (NHC) enhances the quality of life in communities across our state through programs that study the human race, its achievements, its creations, its dreams and aspirations, its failures and triumphs. The NHC promotes a better understanding of Nebraska - who we are and where we have been - to build a better future. The NHC enriches peoples' lives through programs incorporating history, literature, music, politics, philosophy, and other humanities-based disciplines that illuminate the human condition.
