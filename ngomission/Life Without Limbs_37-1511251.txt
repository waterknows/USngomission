Life Without Limbs works to cross boundaries and break down barriers, to build bridges that bring people to the love and hope found in Jesus Christ. Life Without Limbs was founded by Nick Vujicic who was born without arms or legs but was given the strength by God to surmount countless challenges and obstacles. Life Without Limbs is all about sharing this same hope and genuine love that Nick has personally experienced with people all over the globe through the Life Without Limbs website and live speaking events.
