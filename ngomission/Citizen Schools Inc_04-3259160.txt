Founded in 1995, Citizen Schools operates a growing national network of after-school education programs for students in the middle grades (6th, 7th and 8th). Our programs complement classroom learning by engaging students in hands-on learning projects led by adult volunteers after school and supported by a staff of professional educators. Through the demonstration of our powerful impact and partnerships with out-of-school advocates, we are at the forefront of a movement to transform the learning day and improve the educational trajectories of young people across the country. Today Citizen Schools operates in middle schools in seven states, serving 4,400 kids and engaging 3,200 volunteers.
