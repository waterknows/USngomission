The mission of the Montgomery Area Food Bank is to nourish the hungry by educating and mobilizing the community, engaging in partnerships that advance self-sufficiency, and gathering then distributing food and other necessities across 35 Alabama counties.MAFB is a non-profit, 501(c)(3) organization devoted to doing all possible to minimize hunger and food insecurity throughout 35 Alabama counties. Poverty in Alabama is rooted in history and deeply entrenched in the communities we serve. Of the 35 counties served by the MAFB, 11 are considered part of the "Black Belt"- counties that are historically among the poorest in the nation. However, pervasive poverty affects nearly all the communities we serve.  Each year, we reach out to more than 330,000 hungry Alabamians. Those we serve include children (40%), seniors (20%), and others (40%) including the newly unemployed, low-pay working families, the homeless, and disaster victims, among others.
