The YMCA was founded in 1844 in London, England and was first formed in Greenville, South Carolina in 1876. Part of a worldwide movement, the Y puts Christian principles into practice by teaching and modeling the values of CARING, RESPECT, HONESTY and RESPONSIBILITY and by programs that promote good health, strong families, youth leadership and community and international understanding. YMCAs are for people of all faiths, races, abilities, ages and incomes. No one is turned away for inability to pay. YMCAs are at work in more than 120 countries around the world, serving more than 30 million people.
