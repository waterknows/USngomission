An Achievable Dream Middle & High School works to provide a unique challenging disciplined academic environment for children in elementary grades through high school. It is our mission to challenge and motivate all students to exceed their own expectations in academic achievement and social progress and to instill in all children respect for themselves, respect for their adult leaders and respect for core human values by providing all children with a social academic, and moral education. It is our mission to enable each child with the support of his/her family, to attain a vision; to develop a personal, Achievable dream that will light the way for success and job in life as a productive citizen.
