Established in 1981, Homeless Connections has adapted to meet the needs of people both homeless and at-risk of homelessness in the Fox Valley community. Our mission is to end homelessness by connecting individuals and families to resources that promote self-sufficiency and prevent future homeless episodes. Homeless Connections is a leader in the fight against homelessness in the Fox Valley, working collaboratively to improve the quality of living for the people we serve as well as the community as a whole.
