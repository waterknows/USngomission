The Westmoreland County Food Bank (WCFB) supplies food to hungry people through a network of food assistance programs in Westmoreland County. Our 40,000 square foot facility is located in Delmont, Pennsylvania. We serve over 7,000 disadvantaged families each month throughout Westmoreland County. By acquiring food through local donations and government food assistance programs (State Food Purchase Grant and The Emergency Food Assistance Program), WCFB is able to serve the community in several ways: we provide food to meal programs, soup kitchens, food pantries, emergency shelters and child care programs; we provide the means for donors to put their food to good use while gaining tax credits; we keep perfectly good food that can't be sold from becoming garbage in land fills.
