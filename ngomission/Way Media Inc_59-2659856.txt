WAY-FM is a non-profit, faith-based and donor-supported organization. We use media in a culturally relevant way to influence this generation to love and follow Jesus. Since the 1980's WAY-FM remains the only national non-profit media group featuring Christian music and award-winning air talent on local radio stations, social media outlets including listening online, and producing live local concerts for this impressionable generation. Our results are best demonstrated by our local involvement that positively and tangibly impacts every community's youth and young adult culture we serve in.
