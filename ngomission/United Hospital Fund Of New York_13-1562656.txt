Founded in 1879, the United Hospital Fund's primary mission is to shape positive change in health care for the people of New York. We advance policies and support programs that promote high quality, patient-centered health care services that are accessible to all. We undertake research and policy analysis to improve the financing and delivery of care in hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, and other care settings. We raise funds and give grants to examine emerging issues and stimulate innovative programs. And we work collaboratively with civic, professional, and volunteer leaders to identify and realize opportunities for change.
