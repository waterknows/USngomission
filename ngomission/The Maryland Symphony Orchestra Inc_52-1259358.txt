Since its founding in 1982, the Maryland Symphony Orchestra's influence and reputation has reached far beyond Western Maryland. It is one of only four professional symphony orchestras in Maryland and has become a first-class orchestra of exceptional artistic quality. By keeping in mind its mission to provide musical performances and programs that educate and entertain while enhancing the cultural environment of Western Maryland and the surrounding region, the Maryland Symphony Orchestra remains one of the area's greatest treasures.
