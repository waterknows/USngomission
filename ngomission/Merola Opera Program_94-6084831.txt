Named for Gaetano Merola, San Francisco Opera's first General Director, the Merola Opera Program is an 11-week summer training program featuring classes and public performances of operas to give the selected artists a comprehensive education at this early point in their careers. Each year, nearly 800 artists between the ages of 20 and 34 audition at sites across the country and approximately 29 are chosen, making it an illustrious honor to be accepted into the program. Merola participants receive intensive training for 11 weeks. The program is offered free of financial burden to the artists, including their transportation, housing, all training, and a weekly stipend.
