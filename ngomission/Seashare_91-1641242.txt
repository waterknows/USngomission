SeaShare's mission is to engage the seafood industry in a collective effort to improve nutrition for the people served by food banks and feeding centers around the country. It is the only organization that focuses on seafood, and the seafood industry, as a source of nutrition for hunger-relief. SeaShare brings the resources of the fishing industry and related service organizations together to help fight hunger not only in Western Washington, but around the country through the strategic partnership with Feeding America and their national network of food banks.
