Helping Abused Neglected Disadvantaged Youth (HANDY) was founded in 1985 to meet the fundamental needs of Broward County's foster care children. In an effort to keep families together and keep children from entering the foster care system, more children have been placed in the care of non-relative and relative caregivers under Protective Supervision. HANDY provides comprehensive, direct-service programs designed to ensure healthy childhood development by meeting emergency needs for food, clothing, and beds; independent living skills training to assist youth with the transition into adulthood; and providing educational, and independent living skills training including daily transitional living assistance and monitoring, life coaching, and rental subsidy management to assist youth with their transition into adulthood.
