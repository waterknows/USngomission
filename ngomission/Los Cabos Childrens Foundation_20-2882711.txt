Founded in 2005, Los Cabos Children's Foundation works to provide medical, educational and humanitarian assistance to the children, their families and supportive organizations of the Los Cabos area. They assist in providing medical treatment both in Mexico and the U.S. for the children of the Los Cabos area, in providing follow-up medical care for recipients, and in obtaining medical, educational and humanitarian equipment, technology and supplies for the children of the Los Cabos area. In addition, they engage both the non-Mexican community members as well as the Mexican community members in building supportive relationships for the well-being of the children, families and communities of Los Cabos.
