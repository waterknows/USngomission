Scripture Memory Mountain Mission, established in 1932, works to win the unsaved to Christ and encourage them in their Christian walk. Emphasis is placed upon constructive, consistent teaching of the Word of God on the level of the age group concentrating on evangelism, discipleship and Christian service. The mission does this in many ways with the intent of strengthening the local churches. SMMM/Camp Nathanael strives to minister across the spectrum, economically and spiritually. The youth outreaches draw many unchurched young people and opportunities for evangelism are great. The adult programs primarily attract Christians from a variety of denominational backgrounds and various stages of spiritual maturity.
