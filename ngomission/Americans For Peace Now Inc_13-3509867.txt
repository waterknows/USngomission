Americans for Peace Now (APN) was founded in 1981 to support the activities of Shalom Achshav (Peace Now in Israel). APN is the leading United States advocate for peace in the Middle East. APN's mission is to help Israel and the Shalom Achshav movement to achieve a comprehensive political settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict consistent with Israel's long-term security needs and its Jewish and democratic values. APN has a wide array of educational programs that reach out to communities around the country, and is a powerful force for mobilizing grassroots support among U.S. citizens. By demonstrating this support, and by working directly with decision makers and government officials, APN promotes U.S. policies that further the peace process.
