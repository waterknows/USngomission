The United Way of Kennebec Valley serves the community by identifying human care needs, raising and allocating funds to meet those needs, and encouraging volunteers to participate in community service. We are proud supporters of many community initiatives that have been spearheaded by local businesses and citizens to provide help where there is a need.
