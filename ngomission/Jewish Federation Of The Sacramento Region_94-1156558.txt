The Jewish Federation of the Sacramento Region is a philanthropic, not-for-profit organization that provides educational, cultural, and social services and programs within the Jewish community locally and around the world. The Federation movement, collectively among the top 10 charities on the continent, protects and enhances the well-being of Jews worldwide through the values of tikkun olam (repairing the world) and tzedakah (charity and social justice). We serve to empower and give a voice to the community.
