The Music Center Foundation's mission is to provide endowment support through asset management and planned giving fundraising for the Music Center of Los Angeles County, its programmatic and educational activities and its affiliated performing arts companies: Los Angeles Philharmonic, Center Theatre Group, Los Angeles Opera Company, and Los Angeles Master Chorale. The Music Center opened in 1964 and is the home of the 3,197-seat Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, the 740-seat Mark Taper Forum and the Ahmanson Theatre, which offers flexible seating for 1,600 to 2,100. In 2003, the Music Center added the Frank Gehry-designed Walt Disney Concert Hall, which seats 2,265 and is home to the Los Angeles Philharmonic.
