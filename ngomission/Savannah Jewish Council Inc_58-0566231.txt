The Savannah Jewish Federation is charged with the mission to "advance the welfare of the total Jewish community." Through its annual campaign, the Federation is the primary collector and distributor of funds for Jewish causes for Savannah and the surrounding areas. We oversee the distribution of approximately $2,000,000 annually, including Federation allocations to beneficiary agencies in Savannah and around the world, grants through the Jewish Community Foundation of Savannah and financial assistance to the needy.
