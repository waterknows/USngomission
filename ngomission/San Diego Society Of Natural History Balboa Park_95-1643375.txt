The San Diego Natural History Museum traces its roots to an enthusiastic group of amateur naturalists, who formed the San Diego Society of Natural History in 1874. The Museum is the oldest scientific institution in southern California and the third oldest west of the Mississippi. 



The Museum's mission is to interpret the natural world through research, education and exhibits; promote an understanding of the evolution and diversity of southern California and the peninsula of Baja California; and inspire in all a respect for nature and the environment.



Approximately 500,000 individuals enjoy the Museum and its programs each year, including 160,000 pre-schoolers through seniors who participate in environmental science education activities.



In addition to award-winning exhibitions about the natural world, the Museum's Biodiversity Research Center of the Californias serves as the region's "biodiversity hub" of specimens, research and data informing natural resource management.
