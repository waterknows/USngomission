The National Defense University Foundation (NDUF), established in 1982 provides private sector support for the National Defense University (NDU) in mission-oriented areas otherwise not funded by the government. NDU is America's preeminent institution for military, civilian, and diplomatic national security education, research, outreach and strategic studies. Today, NDU provides a rare environment in which senior military officers, diplomats, and professionals from the intelligence, law enforcement, and homeland security communities are educated together in vital national security matters, building networks that will last for years to come.
