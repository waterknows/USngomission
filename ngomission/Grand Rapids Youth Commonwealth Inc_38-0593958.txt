The Boys & Girls Clubs of Grand Rapids Youth Commonwealth mission is to enable all young people to reach their full potential as responsible citizens through education, recreation, and other positive community experiences in partnership with the Grand Rapids Police Department. Boys & Girls Clubs subscribe to the theory that programs should provide youth with a Sense of Belonging, a Sense of Usefulness, a Sense of Competence, and a Sense of Power or Influence. When this has been established, the self-esteem of youth will be enhanced.
