The Chattanooga Area Food Bank (CAFB) was founded in 1982 as an outgrowth of a task force on hunger issues led by area congregations and civic-minded leaders. We work to gather and share grocery products with our neighbors in need. The food bank is a bridge between America's food bounty and those who cannot provide for themselves. Through a network of over 360 nonprofit agencies and churches, CAFB services a 20 county area in Tennessee and Georgia.
