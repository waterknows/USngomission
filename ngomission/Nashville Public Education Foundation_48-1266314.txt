Nashville Public Education Foundation, in collaboration with the leadership of Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools, government officials and community leaders, identifies opportunities and raises private funding for strategic initiatives that will result in transformative improvement in educational outcomes for Nashville's students. We envision a Nashville where all children can attend an excellent public school that will open the door to a rewarding, opportunity rich life; a Nashville where K-12 public education is the pride of the city and a model for the state, country and the world.
