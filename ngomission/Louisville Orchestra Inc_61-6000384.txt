Founded in 1937 by conductor Robert Whitney and Charles Farnsley, Mayor of Louisville, the Louisville Orchestra has been called the cornerstone of the Louisville arts scene. From its beginnings as a part-time ensemble known as the Louisville Philharmonic Society, the Louisville Orchestra has grown to become a major arts organization. A full-time, 71-member ensemble offering a wide variety of concert series to the community, including classical programs featuring world-renowned guest artists, lighter classical and pops performances, and education and family offerings, the Orchestra is also the resident performing group for the Louisville Ballet and the Kentucky Opera. The Louisville Orchestra also performs concerts and provides educational programming throughout both Kentucky and Southern Indiana.
