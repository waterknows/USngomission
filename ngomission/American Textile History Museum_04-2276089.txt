Founded in 1960, the American Textile History Museum (ATHM) tells America's story through the art, history, and science of our textiles. ATHM houses one of the largest collections of its kind in the world. Its collections contain thousands of books, trade catalogs, business records and personal papers, prints and photographs, a growing costume collection, millions of textiles samples, and hundreds of machines used in textile manufacture.
