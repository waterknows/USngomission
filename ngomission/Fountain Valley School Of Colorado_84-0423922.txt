Founded in 1929, Fountain Valley School of Colorado (FVS) offers a college-preparatory, boarding and day school program for motivated students within a close knit and supportive community. FVS is dedicated to providing a rigorous college-preparatory curriculum in academics, athletics and the arts. Our community endeavors to foster a lifelong love of challenge and learning in an environment of diversity and mutual respect, and to prepare adolescents to become individuals who are open-minded, curious, courageous, self-reliant and compassionate. FVS seeks to nurture all students in their pursuit of excellence and strives to develop in all students the core values of open-mindedness, curiosity, courage, self-reliance and compassion.
