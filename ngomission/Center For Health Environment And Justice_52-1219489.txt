Founded in 1981, the Center for Health, Environment and Justice (CHEJ) works to build healthy communities, with social justice, economic well-being, and democratic governance. We believe this can happen when individuals from communities have the power to play an integral role in promoting human health and environmental integrity. Our role is to provide the tools to build strong, healthy communities where people can live, work, learn, play and pray. Our current campaigns focus on environmental health threats to children and building public support for preventive action to protect public health, the environment and our economy. By organizing one school, one neighborhood, one community at a time, CHEJ is making the world cleaner and healthier for all of us.
