Founded in 1979 By the Lubavitcher Rebbe Rabbi M. M. Shneerson, Bris Avrohom has continuously seen to the needs of Russian Jewish immigrants. Bris Avrohom has touched the lives of over 28,000 people by enriching their outlook towards Yiddishkeit and by acquainting them with their 3,300-year-young Jewish heritage and traditions. Through providing brissin, bar mitzvahs, weddings and education for young and old, we are ensuring Jewish vibrancy and continuity. With centers in New Jersey as well as New York, Minnesota and Ukraine, we offer daily minyanim, classes, holiday celebrations, programs and activities for all age groups. Bris Avrohom is open to all Jews from any walk of life and all levels of Jewish knowledge.
