The Bulldog Club, chartered in 1974, is committed to supporting the athletic program at Mississippi State University, primarily by providing scholarships for student-athletes and facilities necessary for the program. Athletics joins academics at Mississippi State to enhance the image of our university. Both go hand-in-hand to promote excellence. The athletic program strives to build the type of program which is first class in every respect, in order to attract quality student-athletes, and to provide facilities necessary for them to successfully compete in the Southeastern Conference.
