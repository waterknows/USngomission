Incorporated in 1969, Bible Broadcasting Network works to get God's word into the hearts and minds of people using the most efficient means at our disposal, radio and the internet. We fulfill our purpose using the unique tools of technology along with a unique blend of ministry-focused programming. The microphones of the Bible Broadcasting Network are as sacred as any pulpit in the world so we broadcast daily prayer times, children's programs, Bible teaching, teen programs and family guidance programs. We also provide a toll-free number for personal guidance. We operate AM and FM radio stations in fourteen countries that reach over 200 million people.
