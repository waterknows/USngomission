Founded in 1908 as a nonsectarian organization through the generosity of Cleveland industrialist Benjamin Rose, the Benjamin Rose Institute on Aging works to raise the standards of care for older adults. The Institute has been an innovator in service delivery, a leader in research, and an advocate for older adults in Northeast Ohio and nationally. Benjamin Rose services include providing home care, adult day care, social work, mental health services, and senior companions through the Eldercare Services Institute; conducting applied gerontological research at the Margaret Blenkner Research Institute; identifying and influencing public policies that impact older adults and their caregivers through the Katz Policy Institute; and providing housing for low-income seniors in the Margaret Wagner Apartments. Expertise in the areas of aging service, research and advocacy is shared through a series of educational programs scheduled throughout the year.
