OneAmerica's works to advance the fundamental principles of democracy and justice through building power in immigrant communities, in collaboration with key allies. Initially named Hate Free Zone, the organization was founded immediately after September 11, 2001 to address the backlash in a post 9/11 world against immigrant communities of color, primarily Muslims, Arab Americans, East Africans, and South Asians. OneAmerica has expanded into the largest immigrant advocacy organization in Washington State and also plays a leading role in national coalitions within the immigrant rights and due process arenas.
