Formed in 1967, The Voice of the Martyrs (VOM) works to: encourage and empower Christians to fulfill the Great Commission in areas of the world where they are persecuted for their involvement in propagating the gospel of Jesus Christ; to give relief to the families of Christian martyrs in these areas of the world; to equip local Christians to win to Christ their enemies who are opposed to the gospel in countries where believers are actively persecuted for their Christian witness; to undertake projects of encouragement, helping believers rebuild their lives and Christian witness in countries that have formerly suffered Communist oppression; and to emphasize the fellowship of all believers by informing the world of atrocities committed against Christians and by remembering their courage and faith.
