The mission of City of Refuge (COR) is to bring light, hope and transformation to the last, lost and least of Atlanta. City of Refuge offers both life saving resources and life building tools to individuals and families in Atlanta who are living on the margin. We understand the need for programs that span multiple areas of need - from food, clothing and shelter to job training, placement, housing, healthcare and education. Our goal is to provide access to and information about the best possible opportunities for success to those who are willing to work hard for positive change.
