Beginning in 1939, the West Virginia Symphony Orchestra (WVSO) provides symphonic concerts throughout West Virginia at a minimal cost to attendees, reaching audiences that would not otherwise have the opportunity to hear live classical music. The WVSO maintains a significant commitment to music education by supporting education programs in Kanawha County Schools, bringing Young People's Concerts to thousands of West Virginia elementary school students annually, and providing support to the West Virginia Youth Symphony. With the assistance of the Segal & Davis Family Foundation, the WVSO has also issued a series of educational CD-ROMs, designed to integrate the Young People's Concert experience into the regular school curriculum.
