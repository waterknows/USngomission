At the Western Pennsylvania Humane Society, the area's oldest and largest animal welfare organization, we believe that every pet deserves a loving home and the chance to be someone's best friend. Since 1874, we have been providing shelter and care for Pittsburgh's unwanted animals - over 130 years of matching wonderful pets with wonderful people. Our goal is to make this region a better place for people and their pets, and in doing so we have developed many innovative outreach and educational programs. In addition to facilitating adoptions, we helped establish the first spay/neuter program for Pittsburgh shelter animals; helped develop a therapeutic program for children with disabilities; investigate over 1,000 cruelty and neglect cases a year; offer obedience classes; and operate www.TelephonePole.org, an online pet lost and found site.
