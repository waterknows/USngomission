The Charlottesville-Albemarle SPCA is a nonprofit animal welfare organization that provides a safe environment for the lost, abandoned, and homeless animals of Charlottesville and Albemarle County and places them in good homes. We strive to set a standard of excellence and leadership in animal care, humane education, and progressive animal welfare programs. Our vision is to save all dogs and cats that are medically treatable and can be behaviorally rehabilitated.
