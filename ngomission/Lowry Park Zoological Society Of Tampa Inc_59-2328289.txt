The region's only dedicated zoological garden, Tampa's Lowry Park Zoo was designed to enhance quality of life in greater Tampa Bay as an affordable leisure destination and center for education and endangered species conservation. Natural outdoor exhibits for more than 2,000 animals from Florida and similar habitats include a Florida wildlife center and manatee hospital, Asian Gardens, Primate World, Free-Flight Aviaries, Wallaroo Station children's zoo, and Safari Africa. The Florida Environmental Education Center (The Zoo School) serves more than 147,000 children annually. Programs offered are summer and holiday camps, daycare, preschool, and kindergarten. Re-opened at its current site in 1988, Lowry Park Zoo is today the number-one family-friendly zoo in the U.S. and recognized by the State of Florida as a center for Florida wildlife conservation and biodiversity.
