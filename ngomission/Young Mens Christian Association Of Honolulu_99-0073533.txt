Founded in 1869, the YMCA of Honolulu is a fellowship dedicated to putting Christian principles into practice through programs that build healthy spirit, mind, and body for all. Since its founding, the YMCA of Honolulu has been a place where families, friends and neighbors come together to build strong communities. Each year the YMCA of Honolulu serves thousands of children, teens and adults in a wide variety of programs, including before and after school, youth sports, teen leadership programs, substance abuse counseling and treatment programs and health and wellness. The YMCA of Honolulu currently operates nine branches throughout Oahu, including Atherton, Central, Kaimuki-Waialae, Kalihi, Leeward, Mililani, Nuuanu, Windward, and Camp H.R. Erdman, the YMCA resident camp on the North Shore.
