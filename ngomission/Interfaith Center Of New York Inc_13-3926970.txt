The Interfaith Center of New York (ICNY) is a secular educational organization founded in 1997. The Interfaith Center of New York seeks to make New York City and the world safe for religious difference by increasing respect and mutual understanding among people of different faith, ethnic, and cultural traditions and by fostering cooperation among religious communities and civic organizations to solve common social problems. ICNY continues to extend its connections with the grass roots religious and community leaders groups across New York City, including Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Muslim, Native American, Shinto, Sikh and Yoruba, Zoroastrian and Afro-Caribbean faiths.
