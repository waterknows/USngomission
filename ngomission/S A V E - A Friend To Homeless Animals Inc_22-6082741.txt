Founded in 1941, SAVE, A Friend to Homeless Animals is an independent non-profit animal shelter dedicated to protecting the health and welfare of homeless companion animals in the greater Princeton area. Through six core programs of Rescue, Shelter, Health and Welfare, Spay/Neuter, Adoption, and Humane Education, SAVE focuses on the rehabilitation and successful placement of treatable and adoptable animals. SAVE endeavors to build, foster, and strengthen the human-animal bond. SAVE operates as a limited admission shelter with contracts to serve Princeton Township, Princeton Borough and Lawrence Township animal control centers. SAVE depends mostly on private contributions to support its six core programs. The shelter facility houses approximately 75 dogs and cats at a time, and helps an average of 400 animals a year.
