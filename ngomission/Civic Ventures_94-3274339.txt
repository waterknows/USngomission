Civic Ventures is leading the call to engage millions of baby boomers as a vital workforce for change. Through an inventive program portfolio, original research, strategic alliances, and the power of people's own life stories, Civic Ventures demonstrates the value of experience in solving serious social problems - from education to the environment and health care to homelessness. Founded in 1998 by social entrepreneur and author Marc Freedman, Civic Ventures works to define the second half of adult life as a time of individual and social renewal. Civic Ventures programs include: encore.org, a network for people who want work that matters in the second half of life; the Purpose Prize; Experience Corps; Encore Career Community College grants; the Next Chapter; and the BreakThrough Award.
