AIDS Foundation Houston, Inc. has been in the fight against HIV/AIDS since the first cases were reported in 1981. Immediately after the first cases began to surface, a group of caring community members came together to provide food and clothing to those devastated by the disease. In June 1982, this group of community activists became officially known as the KS/AIDS Foundation Houston, later renamed, AIDS Foundation Houston (AFH).As expressed in our mission statement, "AIDS Foundation Houston leads the innovative efforts in the prevention of new HIV infections and empowers individuals, families, and communities affected by HIV/AIDS to create and sustain healthy lives." AFH envisions a supportive community free of new HIV infections where individuals affected by HIV/AIDS lead healthy and productive lives without stigma and discrimination. With passion and creativity our staff provide direct care services to over 7,000 men, women and children and prevention education,
