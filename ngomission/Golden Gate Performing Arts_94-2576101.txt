During the fall of 1978, a call went out to men in and around the Castro who liked to sing inviting them to a gathering with the purpose of possibly creating a chorus and, in November of 1978, from the steps of San Francisco City Hall, the world's first openly gay men's chorus sang in public for the very first time. The San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus toured the country, inspired thousands, and helped to ignite the worldwide gay and lesbian choral movement. We create extraordinary musical experiences that inspire community, activism, and compassion.
