Founded in 1929, the Boys & Girls Clubs of Wichita Falls work to inspire and enable all young people, especially those who need us most, to realize their full potential as productive, responsible and caring adults. Boys & Girls Clubs provide a safe place to learn and grow; ongoing relationships with caring adult professionals; life-enhancing programs and character development experiences; and hope and opportunity.
