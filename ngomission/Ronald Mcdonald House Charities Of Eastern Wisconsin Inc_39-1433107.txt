Ronald McDonald House Charities Eastern Wisconsin is dedicated to easing the burden of families whose lives have been disrupted as a result of their child's illness or injury. We provide a home away from home and caring outreach initiatives. Ronald McDonald House is a home away from home for families of seriously ill or injured children. Since our doors opened in 1984, more than 33,000 families have called the Ronald McDonald House in Milwaukee home. In 2011 alone, we served more than 1,000 families. We have been at full occupancy with our 38 guest rooms - often with a wait list of anywhere from 5 to 20 families each day.
