Founded in 1917, United Way of Central Iowa's mission is to improve lives by uniting the caring power of our community. United Way convenes and unites action in three important areas: education, income and health. By making steady advances together, we create opportunities for a better life for all. The partnerships built by United Way of Central Iowa accomplish much more than any single group on its own, because it takes everyone in the community working collectively to address the underlying causes of problems. This is how United Way of Central Iowa is working to advance the common good. It's what we mean to live united.
