Colonial Heights Food Pantry is committed to alleviating hunger and developing collaborative strategies to encourage self-reliance and preserve human dignity. We work to improve the nutrition, health, and quality of life of qualifying needy, poor individuals and families by prociding them assistance in the form of groceries to supplement their dietary needs. We also identify other basic needs of life to which the food pantry, working with other organizations, provides referrals to social services, medical service organizations, and community non-profits.
