Riley Children's Foundation was founded in 1921 to honor beloved Hoosier poet James Whitcomb Riley. Riley Children's Foundation is committed to improving the health and well-being of Indiana's children through our philanthropic leadership in support of Riley Hospital for Children and its research programs, Camp Riley for Youth with Physical Disabilities and the James Whitcomb Riley Museum Home.
