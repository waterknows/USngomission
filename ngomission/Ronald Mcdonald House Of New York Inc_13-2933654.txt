Founded in 1978, the Ronald McDonald House of New York provides temporary housing for pediatric cancer patients and their families. Here families find a strong, supportive and caring environment which encourages and nurtures the development of child-to-child and parent-to-parent support systems. Ronald McDonald House in New York City is the largest facility of its type in the world. The House can accommodate 83 families, and it is filled to capacity almost every night. The House's location in Manhattan, in close proximity to 12 major cancer treatment centers, draws children and families from across the country and the world, as well as from the metropolitan New York City area.
