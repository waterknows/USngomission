United Way of Central New York is here to help people in Onondaga County, to make things better in this community, and to take care of what matters. Our vision is to create a community reaching its full caring potential by focusing community investments on achieving measurable impact. We do the background work that ensures every gift is used as effectively and efficiently as possible. We do research to know where funds are needed and can do the most good. Every funded program addresses one of these five vision areas: nurture, protect and teach young children; help our youth grow into thriving adults; provide a safety net during crisis; enable people living with self sufficiency and independence; and support people facing difficult personal and family problems.
