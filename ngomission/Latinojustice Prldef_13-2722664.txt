For the past 40 years, LatinoJustice PRLDEF has been changing the way Latinos live their lives in the United States and the way our country has lived up to its ideals. By litigating precedent-setting impact cases across the country and training young people to be leaders in their community, LatinoJustice PRLDEF has profoundly improved the way Latinos are treated in U.S. society, working to ensure that they have more opportunities for political, economic, social and educational equality. Litigation has proven to be the best vehicle to pursue social change for national racial/ethnic minorities in the face of a recalcitrant executive and legislative branch.
