Founded in 1973, "Mujeres Latinas en Acci√≥n (Mujeres) empowers Latinas by providing services which reflect their values and culture and by being an advocate on the issues that make a difference in their lives." With this mission and the needs of the community always at the forefront, Mujeres provides high-quality, client-centered, bilingual/bicultural human services addressing critical issues such as domestic violence and sexual assault, leadership and youth development, positive parent support, and economic self-sufficiency. Mujeres also acts as a leading advocate on critical issues to ensure that the voices of those in the communities served are recognized among local and national lawmakers.
