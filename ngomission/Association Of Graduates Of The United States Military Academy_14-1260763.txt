The West Point Association of Graduates is the alumni association of the United States Military Academy. Its mission is to serve West Point and its graduates. The Association of Graduates was founded in 1869 to reunite Academy graduates who found themselves on opposing sides during the American Civil War. Today, the Association continues to strengthen the bonds of the Long Gray Line through assistance to graduates, West Point Societies, and USMA Classes worldwide.
