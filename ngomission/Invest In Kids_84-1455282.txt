Invest in Kids' Mission is to partner with communities to improve the health and well being of Colorado's youngest children (prenatal to age 8), particularly those from low-income families, through effective, research-based programs. Our unique team of professional and socially-minded individuals helped create the foundation of standards and execution essential to our high level of effectiveness. Working in partnership with local communities, we identify, introduce, implement and ensure the success of research-based, proven programs.
