Through research, educational efforts and outreach, the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) Foundation encourages gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Americans to live their lives openly and seeks to change the hearts and minds of Americans to the side of equality. Programs funded in part or in full through the HRC Foundation include: The HRC Coming Out Project, which encourages GLBT and straight-supportive Americans to come out and live openly; The HRC Family Project, which empowers members of the GLBT community to take action to protect their families; The HRC Historically Black Colleges and Universities Outreach Program, which trains student activists to sustain dialogue, build viable student-led GLBT organizations; The HRC Religion and Faith Program, The HRC Research Center, and The HRC Workplace Project.
