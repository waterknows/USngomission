Founded in 1891, Boys & Girls Clubs of San Francisco (BGCSF) serves more than 1,200 youth (ages 6-18) per day, offering a safe place to learn and grow. Our mission is to inspire and enable all young people, especially those from disadvantaged circumstances, to realize their full potential as productive, responsible and caring citizens. We operate nine Clubhouses in the city's toughest neighborhoods, as well as Camp Mendocino, a residential summer Camp in Mendocino County. Dedicated to helping the kids who need us most, BGCSF provides a broad range of programs that inspire young people to realize their full potential as productive, responsible and caring citizens.
