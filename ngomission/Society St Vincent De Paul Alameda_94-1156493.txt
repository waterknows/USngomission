The SVdP mission is to provide direct help to anyone in need in Alameda County. SVdP provides this help through our Dining Room, which serves free meals to the hungry five days a week in downtown Oakland. We operate our Community Center, which includes: two drop-in centers for men, women and children; the Clothing Closet; Homeless & Caring Court; two job-training centers; medical clinics; and referrals. We operate social enterprises (three thrift stores, the Redux Studios & Gallery in Alameda; and electronics recycling) to help fund our programs. And we have a large pool of dedicated volunteers (called "Vincentians") throughout Alameda County who provide grassroots one-on-one assistance to those in need in their communities.
