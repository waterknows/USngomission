Founded in 2001, Angel Foundation helps adults with cancer and their families so that they may live life well with stability, strength and resilience. We accomplish this with an innovative and integrated approach of financial assistance, education and support. Through our "Emergency Financial Assistance" program, adults in active cancer treatment in the Twin Cities receive emergency financial assistance for non-medical basic needs such as food, gas, utilities, rent or mortgage payments. Our "Facing Cancer Together" program provides education and support to families facing a parental cancer diagnosis.
