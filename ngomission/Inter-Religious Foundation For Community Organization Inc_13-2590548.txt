The Interreligious Foundation for Community Organization (IFCO) was founded in 1967 by progressive church leaders and activists. Its purpose is to advance the struggles of oppressed people for justice and self -determination. For almost 40 years, IFCO has assisted the poor and disenfranchised in developing and sustaining community organizations to fight human and civil rights injustices. This work includes education about the realities of the poor in the US and the third world. Through our project Pastors for Peace, IFCO carries out similar work in Chiapas, Mexico; Haiti; and other nations of Central America and the Caribbean. IFCO also provides support for grassroots community organizing projects in urban and rural regions of the United States.
