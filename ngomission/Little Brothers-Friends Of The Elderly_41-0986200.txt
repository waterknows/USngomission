Little Brothers - Friends of the Elderly is a national network of non-profit volunteer-based organizations committed to relieving isolation and loneliness among the elderly. We offer to people of goodwill the opportunity to join the elderly in friendship and celebration of life. In living out this mission, the Minneapolis/St. Paul Chapter of Little Brothers - Friends of the Elderly strives to promote the well-being and independence of older adults in the Twin Cities Metro Area. LBFE staff provides in-home visits and phone calls, acts as advocates, makes referrals to other services, and helps these older adults solve problems. Program staff may also utilize Visiting Volunteers who can offer friendship to these older adults, help reconnect them to their community, and enhance their personal independence. The Twin Cities Chapter was founded in 1972.
