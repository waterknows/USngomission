New Mexico Christian Children's Home is a multi-service agency meeting family needs through residential homes for children; adoptive homes; and single parent homes. We work with family, church, and community to transform each child we serve into a Christian champion who is a respected, responsible citizen through quality group, adoptive, foster, and single-parent homes and services provided by a dedicated professional team under God's direction.
