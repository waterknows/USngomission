Good News Radio, or KSGN, is a ministry that draws people closer to God by providing encouragement, edifying believers and building community through Christian music, mission outreach, and events. Good News Radio is helping fulfill the great commission of Jesus Christ. Christ's commission to us is twofold: to proclaim the Gospel, and to teach all things He has commanded us. Therefore, both an evangelistic and an educational thrust are part of the broadcast ministry of Good News Radio.
