Founded in 1984, Clean Ocean Action (COA) is a broad-based coalition of over 125 active boating, business, community, conservation, diving, environmental, fishing, religious, service, student, surfing, and women's groups. These Ocean Wavemakers work to clean up and protect the waters of the New York Bight. Clean Ocean Action stops ocean pollution with a continuous, relentless effort using research, education, and citizen action to convince our public officials to enact and enforce strict laws to protect our marine resources for today's and future generations.
