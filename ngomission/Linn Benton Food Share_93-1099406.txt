Linn Benton Food Share is the regional food bank for Linn and Benton Counties. Since 1981, Food Share has been committed to fulfilling our goal that Everybody Eats. Through our network of 74 agencies we attempt to reach every person who cannot find enough resources to adequately feed themselves or their family. We prevent hunger by soliciting, transporting, storing and distributing over 5.3 million pounds of food each year to our member agencies--emergency food pantries, soup kitchens, emergency shelters, child and senior care centers, shelter homes, and gleaning groups.
