With roots tracing back to 1911, United Way of Greater Richmond & Petersburg leads the way to solutions for a better community. We accomplish this by: providing community leadership, developing solutions, and raising and leveraging funds for impact. Our goal is to create lasting changes that prevent problems from happening in the first place and it takes everyone in the community working together to reach this goal. We bring together people from all across the community - government, business, faith groups, nonprofits, the labor movement and ordinary citizens - to tackle the issues. United Way advances the common good by focusing on the building blocks of a good life: education, income, and health.
