Junior Achievement of Kentuckiana inspires and prepares young people to succeed in a global economy.

From kindergarten through twelfth grade, Junior Achievement's programs provide financial literacy, work readiness and entrepreneurship education experiences to students that are both unique and exciting, yet fully correlate with the requisite standards of learning in both Kentucky and Indiana. Learning about economics - whether it is a concept as simple as "wants and needs" or as complex as "modern international trade" - is a valuable and enriching experience for students.
