The Make-A-Wish Foundation of New Jersey grants the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions to enrich the human experience with hope, strength and joy. We have granted over 7,000 wishes since our inception in 1983. No child should ever have to endure the struggle and pain that come with battling a life-threatening illness. Giving back to these children, what their illness has taken away - laughter, strength, hope and joy, is our sole purpose at the Make-A-Wish Foundation of New Jersey. The New Jersey Chapter serves the entire state of New Jersey.
