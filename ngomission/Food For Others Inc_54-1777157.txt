Established in 1995, Food for Others obtains and distributes free food to the hungry of Northern Virginia and supports food programs of other community-based organizations. We provide a channel for people to help their neighbors by actively volunteering their service. Food for Others is part of Northern Virginia's safety net for those needing food when an emergency strikes, and for the growing number of working poor who are unable to make ends meet and need to supplement their inadequate food supplies. Food for Others distributed over 2.7 million pounds of free food in FY 2011.
