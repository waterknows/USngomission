Houston Audubon Society (HAS) works to promote the conservation and appreciation of birds and wildlife habitat. HAS owns and maintains 17 nature sanctuaries in the Gulf Coast Area, providing nearly 4,000 acres of habitat for birds and wildlife. Our education department presents innovative natural science programs to nearly 25,000 children and adults annually. Houston Audubon's sanctuaries include pinewoods, coastal mud flats, bottomland hardwood forests, coastal marshes, and urban forests. Our ever-growing sanctuary system includes the internationally known High Island sanctuaries and the Bolivar Flats Shorebird Sanctuary, critically important migratory stopover and nesting habitats that are open to the public year-round.
