The Boy Scouts of America, Central Minnesota Council works to prepare young people to make ethical choices over their lifetime by instilling in them the values of the Scout Law and Oath. Boy Scouts prove themselves in an environment that challenges their courage and tests their nerve. After they've been given the proper guidance from those with experience and know-how, they take their own lead, going places they've never gone, seeing things they've never seen, and diving into the rugged world of outdoor adventure, relying on teamwork and character to accomplish what everyone else thinks is impossible.
