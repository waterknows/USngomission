Founded in 1970, Save The Bay is committed to fostering a personal connection between people and Narragansett Bay and encouraging investment in the Bay's future. Save The Bay and its supporters are an active force in southern New England, working to protect, restore and explore Narragansett Bay and its watershed. Together, we: advocate for better Bay management on the local, state and federal levels; restore Bay habitat - salt marshes, eelgrass beds, fish runs and shorelines - to healthier and functioning conditions; encourage discovery and knowledge of the Bay through our educational programs; and seek to create a community of Bay citizens who will preserve the Bay for generations to come.
