Cool Girls was founded by Dawn Smith in 1989 in response to the desperate plight of young girls living in the East Lake Meadows housing community. Cool Girls' community partners, mentors, and volunteer networks support girls in all aspects of their development by breaking the cycles of poverty, low self-esteem, and teen pregnancy. Our life skill programs develop girls into confident women through education and exposure to a broader world of opportunity. Cool Girls serves over 500 girls through our partnerships with Eleven Title 1 schools in DeKalb and Fulton Counties.
