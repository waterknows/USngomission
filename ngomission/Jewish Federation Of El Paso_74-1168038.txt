The mission of the Jewish Federation of El Paso is to enhance the quality of Jewish life here and overseas to enable Jewish organizations to provide Jewish-oriented cultural, educational, social, and recreational programs and services; and to raise sufficient funds to accomplish this. Among others, our mission focuses on: providing our children, grandchildren and young adults with positive Jewish experiences, programs and services so they will be and remain committed Jews; maintaining and strengthening our ties and relationships with Israel and with Jews in need wherever they live; and strongly advocating for Jewish causes and for Israel within our own community and its media outlets.
