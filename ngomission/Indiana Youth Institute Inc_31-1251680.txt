Founded in 1988, the Indiana Youth Institute (IYI) promotes the healthy development of Indiana children and youth by serving the people, institutions and communities that impact their well-being. Their organizational vision is that all Indiana children and youth will attain five critical elements of healthy youth development: physical health and safety, emotional fulfillment, academic achievement, civic engagement and economic self-sufficiency. IYI provides capacity-building programs and resources for the state's youth workers and nonprofit youth-serving organizations, including schools. The IYI's programs are offered for free or very low cost, allowing youth organizations that are often on tight budgets to save money that can be used instead for their services to youth.
