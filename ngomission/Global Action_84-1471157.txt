Global Action engages and empowers the Global Church into action, helping the Church to fulfill the Great Commission: Christ's great cause for Christians to make disciples of all nations.We have identified a lack of leadership training and proper vision of healthy church as our greatest challenge is to fulfill the charge Christ gave to us, "make disciples of all nations."We have developed a unique system that empowers and equips local pastors and church leaders in "developing" nations by providing them with Biblical and church growth training, missional vision, and a growing network of over 5,500 pastors and church leaders.
