The mission of Arctic Barnabas Ministries is to strengthen and encourage pastor and missionary families to effectively advance the Gospel of Jesus Christ throughout remote Alaska & Northern Canada! Arctic Barnabas Ministries has a deep love for the Native peoples of Alaska and throughout the Arctic - from the Inupiaq in the north, the Cup'ik and Yup'ik in the west, the Aleuts down the Aleutian Island chain, the Alutiiq in southcentral, the Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian in the southeast, and the Athabascans in the interior. We are committed to help advance the Gospel of Jesus Christ to these people groups.
