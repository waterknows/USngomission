Established as a grass roots organization in 1975 by a committed group of citizens, the Danforth Museum of Art, now called Danforth Art, has grown to become a vital cultural resource. Danforth Art provides visitors with entertaining and educational experiences in the visual arts and educates the public through its collection of American art, changing exhibits of contemporary artists, classes and workshops in the School, and a variety of community outreach programs. Danforth Art envisions its future as a nationally recognized leader among community museums and art education centers, with an outstanding collection of American art, as well as exhibitions and programs that engage, inspire and transform the lives of children and adults.
