The Koby Mandell Foundation was founded by Koby's family after his murder in Israel in 2001. They wanted to help people like themselves, struck by terror, be able to return to life, with strength, hope, and healing. The Foundation helps families keep their hearts and spirits open. By facing pain with the support and love of others, families can be strengthened, not destroyed. Our programs are infused with Koby's sense of adventure, spirit and concern for others. We help bereaved families become stronger and keep their hearts open and spirits alive despite their grief. Although therapeutic in nature, our programs are fun and relaxing. They include: Camp Koby, Mother's Healing Retreat, Spiritual Healing Programs, Women's Learning, and the Big Brother/Sister Program.
