The American Lung Association (ALA) of the Southwest consists of the American Lung Associations serving Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah. The American Lung Association is committed to preventing lung disease and promoting lung health through education, research, and advocacy. We offer practical help to people living with asthma, emphysema and other lung diseases. We also confront lung disease at the root level, educating kids about the dangers of smoking, pushing for more smoke-free workplaces and even working to reduce air pollution.
