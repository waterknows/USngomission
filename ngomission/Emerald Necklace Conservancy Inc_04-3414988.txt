The Emerald Necklace Conservancy connects people and parks and conserves the Emerald Necklace through projects and programs to enrich the visitor experience and restore and renew the landscape, waterways and parkways. To steward the Emerald Necklace's 1,100 acres of parkland extending from Boston's Back Bay through Brookline and Jamaica Plain to Franklin Park in Dorchester, the conservancy works in collaboration with its partners on advocacy, maintenance and restoration, education and access, and promoting park stewardship through volunteer and youth programs.
