Founded in 1996, the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) fosters public health through scientific discovery, translational research, and the dissemination of research results through specially-configured, high-impact public-private partnerships consistent with the priorities of the NIH. The foundation is not only involved in large, ambitious initiatives with potentially high impact on the lives of millions of the world's citizens, but it also supports smaller focused programs in clinical training and ancillary support programs. With the goals of NIH as its guide, the foundation serves both the public and private sectors, helping them achieve significant breakthroughs in human health in areas of interest that overlap with those of NIH.
