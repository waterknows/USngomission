The Food Bank of Eastern Michigan, established in 1981, serves 22 counties of Michigan, serving those in need through nearly 400 non-profit, partner agencies. We serve as a common solicitor, storehouse and distributor of food on behalf of our Partner Agencies. Our food comes from surpluses in the grocery industry. The Food Bank of Eastern Michigan is one of six food banks in the state who also make up the Food Bank Council of Michigan. In 2008, the Food Bank experienced a 6% increase in pounds distributed with overall distribution over 17 million pounds of food.
