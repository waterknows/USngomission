Founded in 1990, Us Too International's mission has been to serve as a resource for peer-to-peer prostate cancer support and educational materials provided at no charge to help men and their spouses/partners/families make informed decisions about prostate cancer detection, treatment options and related side effects. In addition to support groups, Us TOO provides comprehensive digital resources about prostate cancer, treatment options, emerging treatments, advocacy and volunteer information. We distribute a monthly newsletter and feature links to a number of bulletin boards, that provide the opportunity to exchange information with others who are battling prostate cancer.
