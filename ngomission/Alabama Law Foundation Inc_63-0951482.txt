The Alabama Law Foundation, founded in 1987, is composed of several separate programs, each providing ways for lawyers to better their profession and their communities. The foundation makes annual grants to organizations that provide free legal aid to the poor in civil cases, for projects that improve the administration of justice and for law-related education. In addition, law school scholarships are funded to help the next generation of lawyers.
