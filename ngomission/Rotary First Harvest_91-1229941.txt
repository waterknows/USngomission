Founded in 1982, Rotary First Harvest connects farmers, truckers, volunteers and food banks for hunger relief. Food banks across Washington are serving millions of families and individuals who are struggling to put food on the table. RFH's core work is to identify truckload-sized donations (typically 40,000 pounds) of produce from farmers, packing houses and processors, then arrange for donated or discounted trucking to deliver the produce to one of our hunger relief partners' distribution warehouses. From there, the produce is distributed to more than 450 hunger relief organizations.Our Harvest Against Hunger (HAH) program has been named one of the most effective AmeriCorps programs in the nation, and with good reason. HAH places AmeriCorps*VISTA members (known as Harvest VISTA) directly at food bank and food pantry locations to develop gleaning and produce recovery programs that connect local small and medium scale farmers, volunteers and local hunger relief efforts.
