The Community Service Society was formed by the merger of two of New York City's most prominent social welfare organizations, the New York Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor, organized in 1843 and incorporated in 1848, and the Charity Organization Society, founded in 1882. CSS is on the cutting edge of public policy innovations to support poor New Yorkers in their quest to be full participants in the civic life of the nation's largest city. The mission of the CSS is to identify problems which create a permanent poverty class in New York City, and to advocate the systemic changes required to eliminate such problems. CSS employs a variety of tools - advocacy, direct service, research and policy analysis, and strategic partnerships - to forge consensus on appropriate policy interventions to facilitate the economic mobility of low-income New Yorkers.
