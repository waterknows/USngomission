Rofeh Cholim Cancer Society (RCCS) incorporated in 1997 with a five-point mandate to help cancer victims: help cancer patients secure the best health insurance policies possible; provide whatever financial assistance is needed to maintain health insurance policies; keep abreast of the newest and most effective cancer treatments; provide the best medical referrals; and advocacy for the cancer patient and the patient's entire family. RCCS has never declined a valid application for help. Its singular mission, duplicated by no other organization, has helped save the lives of over one thousand cancer patients across the United States.
