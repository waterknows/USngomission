Our Little Haven was founded in 1993 by Scott and Kathleen Hummel. We have grown over the years from an organization serving 30 children annually through one program to one serving over 600 children annually through a suite of 4 programs. Our Little Haven is relentlessly committed to providing a safe, secure and healing environment for children suffering from the tragedy of abuse and neglect. Our dedicated and compassionate community of caregivers makes the hurting stop, the healing begin and the love last, one child at a time.
