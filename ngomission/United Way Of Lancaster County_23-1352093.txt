Since 1925, United Way of Lancaster County has helped local contributors invest in our community. Our experience tells us that the best way to help the most people is to focus on the underlying causes of our area's most serious problems. That is why we are concentrating on critical issues such as child care, health care services, housing and education. Working with government, businesses, faith based groups, nonprofits and volunteers, United Way is creating lasting change in Lancaster County. Together, we are achieving results that no one sector can accomplish alone. Because that is what matters.
