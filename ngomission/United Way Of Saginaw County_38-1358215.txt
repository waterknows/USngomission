United Way of Saginaw County helps create community impact everyday by connecting community resources and volunteers. United Way is a volunteer-directed nonprofit organization operated by trained staff that promotes volunteerism, raises funds to address important health and human service issues, and insures the money donated is used in the most efficient and effective manner possible. United Way volunteers research the needs of the community, informs the community of those needs, and makes sure United Way dollars are distributed to programs that best address those issues.
