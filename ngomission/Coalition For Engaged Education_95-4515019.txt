Coalition for Engaged Education focuses on youth in crisis: foster youth, incarcerated youth, dropouts, and youth with significant social and economic barriers to success. In all of our programs we connect youth with caring adults, we match them to the ideal educational opportunity, we identify their passion(s), and we stay with them throughout their journey. CEE is not about 1-month or 6-month interventions; it is about partnering with the students and staying with them through their academic careers and beyond.We create individual relationships with our students and look for the things that will excite them. We partner with organizations that offer arts education so that our students can express themselves and feel heard. We surround our students with love and hope and let them know there is always another chance. Ultimately, we want all of our students to be successful in whatever they are passionate about and to find their way to meaningful, sustainable lives.
