North Country Food Bank, Inc. is associated with Feeding America a national hunger relief organization. Under their umbrella there are 201 food banks around the US that make up a sophisticated distribution network that captures donations & surplus food in order to redeliver to local agencies like food shelves, soup kitchens, homeless shelters including those that serve children and seniors. These agencies rely on food banks to capture food opportunities that are too large for them to handle. Our non-profit food bank distributed over 7.4 million pounds of food last year to over 230 hunger relief agencies and programs within our 21 county service area in northwest, west central Minnesota and part of Grand Forks, North Dakota. North Country Food Bank has been serving this area since 1983. We are working hard to evolve in a sustainable manner, developing innovative programs to assist our manufacturing & agriculture partners while improving the lives of those in need.
