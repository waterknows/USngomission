George Eastman House, opened to the public in 1949, is an independent museum and educational institution that tells the story of photography and motion pictures -- media that have changed and continue to change our perception of the world. We collect and preserve objects that are of significance to photography, motion pictures, and the life of George Eastman; build information resources to provide the means for both scholarly research and recreational inquiry; keep and care for images, literature, and technology to tell the story of photography and the motion picture in history and in culture; and care for George Eastman's house, gardens, and archives, maintaining them for public enjoyment and as a memorial to his contribution to our lives and our times.
