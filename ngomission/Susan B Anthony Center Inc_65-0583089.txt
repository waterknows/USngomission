Created from the vision of a small group of women in the Junior League of Greater Fort Lauderdale in 1995, The Susan B. Anthony Recovery Center has grown from one group home, housing five mothers and six children, to a beautiful 5.5 acre campus in Pembroke Pines with the capacity to serve over sixty families. In addition, through satellite campuses, we are increasing our capacity to serve many more. Our ultimate goals are the removal of barriers for women entering addiction treatment, the prevention of foster care placement for their children, and an end to the cycle of addiction and abuse for families.
