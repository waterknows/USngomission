Founded in 1955 as The Academy for Boys in Albuquerque with twelve students, two teachers and the founding headmaster, today Albuquerque Academy is home to over one thousand girls and boys in grades 6 through12. An independent, college-preparatory day school situated on a scenic 312-acre campus in northeast Albuquerque, the Academy's mission centers on academic excellence, inclusiveness, accessibility, and community outreach. We believe that children's lives change when their natural passion for learning is nurtured and transformed into habits of life-long learning and reflection. We believe that the world changes as these children learn to serve country and community with wisdom, conviction, and compassion.
