Jewish Family Services of Greater Kansas City (JFS) is the place to turn when dealing with both crises and life's everyday challenges. With a highly-skilled and compassionate staff, JFS is available to help you make life more manageable. We were founded upon the Jewish value of preserving the well-being, comfort, and dignity of others. We always respect the confidentiality of our clients. While our priority is to serve the Jewish community, the Jewish value of Tikkun Olam (repairing the world) inspires us to serve all people, in fact over half of the 5,000 people we serve each year are not Jewish. We dedicate ourselves each day to providing peace of mind and a better life for everyone we serve, regardless of age, race, ethnicity, religious affiliation or economic situation.
