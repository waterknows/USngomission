United Way of Greater Cleveland mobilizes our community and its resources to advance education, income and health to positively impact lives. This work touches more than 450,000 Greater Cleveland residents every year. United Way's 2-1-1 health and human service referral service answered more than 266,000 calls for help last year. And United Way has taken a strong stand on behalf of our low income youth by funding 19 youth development programs in our community. United Way funded programs are working daily in our community to provide food and shelter to those in greatest need, job training and stay-in-school strategies to get on track for a better future and information and resources to avoid health risks and live healthy lives.
