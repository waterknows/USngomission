The oldest program of its kind in San Diego, the San Diego Rescue Mission opened its doors in 1955. Since then, the San Diego Rescue Mission has grown to help thousands of men, women and children get back on their feet. Through valuable programs like one to one counseling, drug recovery and relapse prevention, and continuing education, the San Diego Rescue Mission reaches out to hurting people with real solutions. We provide hope to the helpless by forging the best clinical practices with the transforming love of Jesus Christ to yield powerful life-changing results. Our programs and services include a 12-month holistic rehabilitation program for men, women and their children, and Nueva Vida Haven, an emergency shelter for women and their children.
