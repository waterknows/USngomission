Can Do Canines is dedicated to enhancing the quality of life for people with disabilities by creating mutually beneficial partnerships with specially trained dogs. We envision a future in which every person who needs and wants an assistance dog can have one. In 1987 we incorporated as the Companion Dog Connection, Inc. Over time we increased our service area to include Wisconsin, North and South Dakota, and Iowa and added new services, providing assistance dogs to people with seizure disorders, children with autism, and people with diabetes complicated by hypoglycemia unawareness. We provide the training and placement services free of charge to our clients. We will also consider keeping a relationship together and training a client's pet dog. We work with local shelters and rescue organizations to identify dogs suitable for assistance dog work. We have a social justice initiative where we work with inmates in Waseca Women's Federal Prison and Faribault State Prison for puppy raising.
