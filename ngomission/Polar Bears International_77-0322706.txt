Polar Bears International's mission is to conserve polar bears and the sea ice they depend on. Through media, science, and advocacy, we work to inspire people to care about the Arctic, the threats to its future, and the connection between this remote region and our global climate. We serve as the global resource for information regarding polar bears and their habitat and are the leading voice on climate warming impacts to polar bears and their Arctic home while actively seeking solutions through education, advocacy, and action. We conduct, support, and share scientific research that informs polar bear conservation and educate an international audience about polar bear conservation and provide mentorship for the actions that will help ensure their survival.
