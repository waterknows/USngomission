Founded in 1944, Boys & Girls Clubs of Santa Monica currently serves approximately 7,000 youth through memberships and community outreach. They come from all over Los Angeles County, largely from Santa Monica, Venice, Culver City, West Los Angeles and Inglewood. Members pay a $20 annual fee for access to all Club amenities and programs that span across education, leadership, recreation and more. The Club operates with the objective of serving young people from all backgrounds, regardless of economic circumstances - ensuring that youth ages 6 to 18 have a safe and nurturing environment to develop socially, succeed in school, stay physically active and prepare for positive futures.
