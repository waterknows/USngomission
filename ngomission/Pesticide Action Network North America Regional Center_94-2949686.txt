Pesticide Action Network North America (PANNA) works to replace pesticide use with ecologically sound and socially just alternatives. As one of five PAN Regional Centers worldwide, we link local and international consumer, labor, health, environment and agriculture groups into an international citizens' action network. This network challenges the global proliferation of pesticides, defends basic rights to health and environmental quality, and works to insure the transition to a just and viable society. Other PAN Regional Centers include PAN Africa, PAN Asia/Pacific, PAN Europe and PAN Latin America.
