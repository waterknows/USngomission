The mission of the Interstitial Cystitis Association is giving hope to all those living with interstitial cystitis (IC), as well as the healthcare providers and researchers who strive to improve the lives of IC patients. IC is a condition consisting of pelvic pain, pressure, or discomfort related to the bladder, typically associated with urinary urgency or urinary frequency. IC may also be referred to as painful bladder syndrome (PBS). The ICA provides advocacy, research funding, and education to ensure early diagnosis and optimal care with dignity for people affected by IC.
