Grist is the nation's favorite independent source of green news and views. Grist has been dishing out environmental news and commentary with a wry twist since 1999 -- which, to be frank, was way before most people cared about such things. Now that green is in every headline and on every store shelf, Grist is the one site you can count on to help you make sense of it all. Grist provides incisive and irreverent information that connects readers to the environmental issues that are part of everyday life, like food, energy, climate, politics, consumption, and pop culture.
