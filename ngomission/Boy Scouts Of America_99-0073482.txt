The Aloha Council of the Boy Scouts of America aims to develop leaders for life. We promote, supervise, administer the educational and recreational program of the Boy Scouts of America for character development, citizenship training and physical fitness within the territory covered by the charter granted by the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America. Perhaps the most unique aspect of Scouting is that - unlike many other activities - it doesn't focus on competition - it focuses on achievement. Something everyone experiences in Scouting and strives for in their day to day lives.
