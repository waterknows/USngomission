Founded in 1982, The Joyce Theater Foundation works to serve and support the art of dance and choreography, to promote the richness and variety of the art form in its fullest expression, and to enhance the public interest in, and appreciation of, dance and the allied arts of music, design, and theater. The Foundation's programs embrace the entire spectrum of movement styles and traditions, from the time-honored to the untried, and are designed to encourage, sustain, and educate a diverse audience. The Joyce oversees two of New York's leading dance venues: The Joyce Theater, a 472-seat theater in Chelsea, and Joyce SoHo, a dance center in lower Manhattan that offers dance studios for rehearsals and performances.
