Towards the end of The Great Depression, Mavel Sherman started Bread of Life in a building on the corner of Washington and Occidental Street in downtown Seattle. Bread of Life exists to overcome the cycle of homelessness in people's lives through a Christ-centered complete recovery model with God's help. Our core values are to: restore dignity and hope; share the gospel and encourage and respect all who come to the mission.
