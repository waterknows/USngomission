The American Studies Center (ASC) aims to engage in nonpartisan analysis, study and research into the interrelationship of governmental systems, activities and policies on the private sector of the United States and to make the results available to the general public. Radio America produces and distributes daily and weekly programs and commentaries on public policy issues totaling more than 4,000 hours of broadcast time per year and airing on over 500 stations, satellite radio and the Internet. The American Veterans Center seeks to preserve and pass on the legacy of valor and sacrifice of American veterans. The Center does this through publications, documentaries, conferences and youth outreach programs carried out through its two projects: the World War II Veterans Committee and the National Vietnam Veteran's Committee.
