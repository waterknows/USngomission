Since assuming stewardship responsibility for Blithewold in 1999, Blithewold, Inc. has concentrated on rebuilding a broad base of support for the property in the community and amongst horticultural enthusiasts to preserve New England's finest garden estate through excellence in horticulture and historic preservation, and by our example to teach and inspire others. Blithewold, a 33-acre summer estate with grand views of Narragansett Bay, is nationally significant in American history as one of the most fully developed and authentic examples of the Country Place era. The property features a 45-room mansion filled with family heirlooms framed by a series of lovely gardens that range in character from mysterious to exotic and from poetic to practical. An exceptional collection of rare and unusual plants, specimen trees, an accessible greenhouse, and whimsical stonework project a character that is romantic, fresh and inspiring â€“ and unique to Blithewold.
