Water Education Foundation, an impartial organization, works to create a better understanding of water issues and help resolve water resource problems through educational programs. The Foundation reaches a broad audience, including policy makers and leading stakeholders in the agricultural, environmental, and urban water groups; journalists, who assist our efforts to educate the general public; and school children - and their families - in grades K-14. The Foundation's goal is to explain the complexities of various opinions and ideas so that people can make better-informed decisions about one of our most critical resources - water.
