The New World Foundation supports community activists across America and around the world. We believe global and national social change begins at the local level. We have helped progressive activists build stronger alliances for social justice, civil rights, and economic and electoral issues since 1954. We have distributed nearly $50,000,000 to grantees over the last 15 years. New World contributes resources to promote democratic action and participation, so people can make a difference for themselves. Through partnerships with donors and our own endowment, our grantmaking in 2008-9 will exceed 10 million dollars.
