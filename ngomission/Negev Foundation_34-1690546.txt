Incorporated in 1992, The Negev Foundation is a dynamic resource for the development of Israel's southern region, the Negev. The Foundation supports proven scientific technological and human innovation, and promotes sustainable desert development including agricultural innovations successfully applied in Israel. The Foundation brings together the private farmer, research stations, commercial growers, academic institutions, foreign investors and generous benefactors committed to the growth and success of a modern, democratic country. Through this blend of dynamic players, The Foundation encourages economic self-sufficiency, replacing philanthropic support with business ventures and income derived through the sale of technology in addition to improving the overall quality of life for all inhabitants of the region.
