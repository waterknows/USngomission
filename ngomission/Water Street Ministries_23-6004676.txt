Since 1905 our purpose has been to advance the kingdom of God through the gospel of Jesus Christ and to do missionary, relief, and rescue work of all kinds. As the only year-round emergency shelter in Lancaster, PA, we believe homes, jobs and support are three critical answers for individuals who find themselves in the traumatic crisis of homelessness. However, to truly end cycles of homelessness, we have a vision to help individuals come to know lasting, life transformation. Then, they can break out of lifestyles that may have led to their homelessness.
