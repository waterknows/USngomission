Founded in 1955, The Citrus Center Boys & Girls Club works to inspire and enable all young people, especially those from disadvantaged circumstances, to realize their full potential as productive, responsible, and caring citizens. We are dedicated to ensuring that our community's youth have access to quality programs and services that will enhance their lives and shape their future. We offer programs developed by the National Boys & Girls Club Corporate Office to impact character and leadership development, education and career development, health and life skills, the arts, sports and fitness, and technology skills.
