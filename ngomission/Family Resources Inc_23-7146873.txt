Since 1970, Family Resources has been the agency to turn to for crisis counseling, safe shelter and safe respite for runaway and homeless teens. We are committed to making a difference in the lives of those who need our help and have no where else to turn. Our mission is to strengthen families and build better communities by providing prevention, support and counseling to children, teens and families. We accomplish this through our belief and vision that every child should be safe, that every troubled teen deserves help, and that every family torn apart in crisis be given the opportunity to mend.
