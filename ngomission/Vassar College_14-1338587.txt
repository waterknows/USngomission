Founded in 1861, Vassar College is a highly selective, residential, coeducational liberal arts college. We have a diverse student body (2,450 students from 50 states and 50 countries), a distinguished faculty (290 members), a low student-faculty ratio (9:1), an idyllic 1,000-acre campus, and exceptional facilities. We believe that the best foundation for a successful life is a broad foundation - an understanding and an appreciation of the range of ideas and methods of inquiry and artistic achievements that have shaped the human experience. Vassar is in Poughkeepsie, a small city on the east bank of the magnificent Hudson River, 75 miles north of New York City.
