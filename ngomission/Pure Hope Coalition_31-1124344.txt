PureHope's ministry is anchored in core principles that are embodied in texts such as 1 John 3:3,1 Thessalonians 4:3-4, Ephesians 5:31-32, 2 Corinthians 5:17, and 1 Corinthians 6:18-20, and we believe that purity in thought, word, and deed is God's desire for us and the result of His sanctifying work within us. Our vision is a world free of sexual exploitation and brokenness, and we work toward that through our mission of providing Christian solutions in a sexualized culture. In short, we equip individuals, families, and churches to pursue sexual purity and oppose sexual exploitation.
