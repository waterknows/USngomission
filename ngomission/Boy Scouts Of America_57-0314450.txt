The Palmetto Council is chartered by the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) to provide support to local Scouting programs in six counties in South Carolina. The BSA provides a program for young people that builds character, trains them in the responsibilities of participating citizenship, and develops personal fitness. The counties we serve are Spartanburg, Chester, Cherokee, Lancaster, Union and York. We provide support for over 200 Cub Scouting, Boy Scouting, Venturing, Exploring, and Learning for Life programs at local community organizations throughout all six counties.
