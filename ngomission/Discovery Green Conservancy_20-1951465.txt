Discovery Green Conservancy works to provide an uncommonly beautiful, urban green space in the heart of Houston that serves as a village green for our city, a source of health and happiness for our citizens and a window into the incredible diversity of talents and traditions that enrich life in Houston. Discovery Green achieves its mission through continuous programming, attracting a diverse crowd, and maintenance to keep the park beautiful. These actions create a social, health, cultural, and economic impact on Houstonians and visitors.
