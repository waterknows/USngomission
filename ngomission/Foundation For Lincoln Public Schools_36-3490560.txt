In strategic partnership with Lincoln Public Schools, the Foundation works with donors to create opportunities for student success. With public school funds dwindling and expenses rising, the Foundation for LPS was created to seek critical resources needed to help teachers achieve the ambitious educational goals they have for our children. Since inception, the Foundation for Lincoln Public Schools has donated around $26 million to LPS for enhanced programs and critical needs.
