Founded in 1946, Church World Service works with partners to eradicate hunger and poverty and to promote peace and justice around the world. CWS meets disaster relief and recovery needs, facilitates sustainable social and economic development, provides assistance and resettlement services to refugees and helps address the root causes of hunger. A cooperative ministry of 36 Christian denominations and communions, CWS sponsors community-wide CROP Hunger Walks across the U.S. to raise awareness and fund to help end hunger locally and globally.
