Fauna & Flora International (FFI) was founded in 1903 and is the world's first international conservation organization. We have been working for more than a century on innovative approaches that inspire others and make a lasting impact on global biodiversity. Our vision is a sustainable future for the planet, where biodiversity is effectively conserved by the people who live closest to it, supported by the global community. Our mission is to act to conserve threatened species and ecosystems worldwide, choosing solutions that are sustainable, are based on sound science and take account of human needs. FFI works in over 100 projects in 40 countries, choosing projects with a committed local partner and a critical need to save endangered wildlife and habitat. FFI's lean, entrepreneurial structure allows us to engage quickly and effectively, positioning us for maximum impact and sustainable results.
