Atlanta Ronald McDonald House Charities' mission is to serve the needs of children by providing temporary housing and support services for families of ill and injured children being treated at local hospitals. Our Houses are built on the simple idea that nothing else should matter when a family is focused on healing their child. Services include housing, meals, 24-hour transportation to and from the hospital, laundry facilities, positive distractions and the opportunity to connect with other families going through similar experiences.
