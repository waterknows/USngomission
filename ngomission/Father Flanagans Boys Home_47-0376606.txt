Boys Town is a beacon of hope for America's children and families through its life-changing youth care and health care programs across the United States. Founded by Father Edward Flanagan in 1917, Boys Town is nearly 100 years strong. Through a continuum of family services, the nonprofit, nonsectarian organization provides the right services at the right time based on a child's or family's needs. Boys Town offers children and families services in their own homes, or, when necessary, family-like out-of-home services to children. Boys Town works with communities and schools in order to meet the growing and more diverse needs of today's children and families. The nonprofit touches the lives of more than 2 million people each year.
