The Bachmann-Strauss Dystonia & Parkinson Foundation was established in 1995 and has gone on to raise more than $35 million to fund 235 ground-breaking research grants in genetics, drug discovery, deep brain stimulation, and understanding the overlaps between dystonia and Parkinson's disease, and to provide medical and patient information through its annual Think Tank and Patient Symposium. BSDPF also has contributed $1.4 million to establish four Centers of Excellence at leading medical research institutions across the United States. These Centers at Mount Sinai Beth Israel in New York City, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, The University of California, San Francisco, and the University of Florida in Gainesville, have helped set the standard of care for the dystonia and Parkinson's community. In 2014, BSDPF formed a collaborative research alliance with The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research. Through the alliance, BSDPF will continue its mission by establishing The Bachmann-Strauss Prize for Excellence in Dystonia Research and enabling support of research exploring the various interfaces between dystonia and Parkinson's disease.
