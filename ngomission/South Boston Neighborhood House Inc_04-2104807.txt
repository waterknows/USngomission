Founded in 1907, The South Boston Neighborhood House impacts the lives of 2000 individuals each year from infants to nonagenarians. Our focus is families and our five program and service areas, Early Education & Care Preschool, School Age Programs, Education & Career Development, Senior Programs and Family Engagement, are designed to work together to strengthen the fabric of family and community life through education and opportunity. The South Boston Neighborhood House is the oldest continually operating human service agency in South Boston, and the community's only independent multi-service provider. As an independent and stand-alone agency, South Boston Neighborhood House can be flexible, rapid in our response to community needs and at the forefront of community issues.
