Founded in 1977, Corporate Accountability International (formerly Infact) and its members have challenged corporate abuses that endanger public health, democratic institutions, the environment and people's lives. Our campaigns have called some of the world's largest transnationals to account, forcing each to respond to the public interest. Corporate Accountability and its members organize a range of ongoing grassroots actions to hold corporations accountable for their abuses.
