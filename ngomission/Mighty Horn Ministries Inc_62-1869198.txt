Mighty Horn Ministries' full time pursuit is to rescue souls by spreading the gospel of Jesus Christ through any medium available, including but not limited to Christian music, preaching, teaching, films and videos. Over the last two decades the reverberations of Phil Driscoll's Trumpet have echoed throughout America and across the borders of more than 35 countries worldwide. Using three fingers and a blast of air he transcends language with a musical message that shatters the barriers between men, and expands the boundaries of faith in God.
