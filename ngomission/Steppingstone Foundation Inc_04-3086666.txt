Founded in 1990, The Steppingstone Foundation develops and implements programs which prepare urban schoolchildren for educational opportunities that lead to college. The Steppingstone Academy prepares motivated urban schoolchildren for acceptance and success at top independent and public exam schools in the greater Boston area. After gaining admission to the Academy, scholars participate in a rigorous academic preparation component that spans 14 months. After completing the 14-month component, Steppingstone provides comprehensive support services, including college counseling, through middle and high school. After graduating from high school, scholars stay connected to Steppingstone through alumni relations.
