Organized in 1987, Grapevine Relief And Community Exchange (GRACE) is a Grapevine, Texas based relief agency which provides food, clothing, financial assistance, and other vital necessities to people who are struggling with a limited income or recent emergency. The philosophy of GRACE is that encouraging self-sufficiency will, in turn, encourage community cohesiveness. Compassion and assistance are offered as a response to God's grace by local churches in partnership with municipalities, businesses, civic organizations, and individuals. Programs have grown to include technology training classes, low cost medical services, transitional housing, and general emergency assistance, such as food, clothes, furniture, financial assistance, information and referrals.
