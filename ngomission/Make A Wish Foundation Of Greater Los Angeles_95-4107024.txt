The Make-A-Wish Foundation of Greater Los Angeles grants the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions to enrich the human experience with hope, strength, and joy. Since 1983, we have brightened the lives of over 8,300 children with a wide range of life-threatening medical conditions. The Make-A-Wish Foundation of Greater Los Angeles will fulfill a wish for any child who is over the age of 2 1/2 years and under 18 (at the time of referral) in Los Angeles County with a progressive, degenerative, or malignant life-threatening medical condition that has placed the child's life in jeopardy.
