Coalition for the Homeless of Central Florida was created in 1987 by a group of concerned citizens who noted a growing problem of homelessness in the community. The Coalition is now the largest provider of homeless services in Central Florida. We help to transform the lives of homeless men, women and children by providing crucial services to end their crisis of homelessness. Our goal is to return our residents to self-sufficiency through counseling, job training, and educational programs. While our clients work to reestablish productive lives, we provide transitional housing and daycare for their children until they are ready to move back into the community.
