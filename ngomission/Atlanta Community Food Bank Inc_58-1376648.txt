The Atlanta Community Food Bank (ACFB) began operating in 1979 in a small space at St. Luke's Episcopal Church, and now distributes over 51 million pounds of food and grocery products a year from a 129,600 square-foot facility in N.W. Atlanta. This product is utilized by more than 600 partner nonprofits that provide food assistance to families and individuals in 29 counties in greater Atlanta and north Georgia. ACFB leads seven distinct projects that reinforce its mission to fight hunger by engaging, educating and empowering our community: Atlanta Prosperity Campaign, Atlanta's Table, Community Gardens, Hunger 101, Hunger Walk/Run, Kids In Need and Product Rescue Center.
