The Boys & Girls Club of Cheyenne opened its doors in November 1997 when a group of concerned citizens saw the need for a place to mentor youth here. Since then, the Club has been in the forefront of youth development, working with young people from disadvantaged economic, social, and family circumstances. The Club has actively sought to enrich the lives of girls and boys whom other youth agencies failed to reach. The Club's mission is to inspire and enable all young people, especially those who need us most, to realize their full potential as productive, responsible and caring citizens.
