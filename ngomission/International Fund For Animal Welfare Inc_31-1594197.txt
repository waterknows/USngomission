IFAW saves animals: elephants at risk from poachers, whales and seals threatened by cruel hunts, wildlife threatened by habitat loss and conflict with people, and dogs and cats stranded after disasters or at risk from cruelty. We help individual animals in distress and win policy changes that provide long-term protections. 



Founded in 1969, the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) works to improve the welfare of wild and domestic animals throughout the world by reducing commercial exploitation of animals, protecting wildlife habitats, and assisting animals in distress. We seek to motivate the public to prevent cruelty to animals and to promote animal welfare and conservation policies that advance the well-being of both animals and people. 



IFAW is an international organization and this site only includes financial information for IFAW's US entity. We encourage people to read our consolidated international financial information in our Annual Report on www.ifaw.org.
