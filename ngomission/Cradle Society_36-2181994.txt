The Cradle's mission is to benefit children and all others touched by adoption - by compassionately delivering exceptional education, guidance and lifelong support to build, sustain and preserve nurturing families. Renowned as one of the foremost adoption and child welfare agencies in the country since opening in 1923, The Cradle has helped place more than 15,000 children into lasting, loving homes. We provide lifelong support for anyone with an adoption connection - birth parents, adoptive parents and adopted persons. The Cradle is the only U.S. adoption agency with an onsite, 24-hour infant nursery. It provides a safe, temporary, neutral place for babies to stay while their birth parents continue their counseling. The Cradle Nursery is also a haven for infants who have special medical needs and may require a bit more time until a capable, loving family is identified for them.
