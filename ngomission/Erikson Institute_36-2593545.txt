Erikson Institute is the nation's premier graduate school in child development. Since 1966, we've prepared professionals to understand and meet the changing needs of young children and their families. We focus exclusively on children from birth to age eight - the most important formative years. Through our academic programs, applied research, and community service and engagement, Erikson advances the ability of practitioners, researchers, and decision makers to improve life for children and their families. The Institute is a catalyst for discovery and change, continually bringing the newest scientific knowledge and theories of children's development and learning into its classrooms and out to the community so that professionals serving children and families are informed, inspired, and responsive.
