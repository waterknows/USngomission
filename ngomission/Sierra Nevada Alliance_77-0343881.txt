Since 1993, the Sierra Nevada Alliance has been protecting and restoring Sierra lands, water, wildlife and communities. Their mission is to protect and restore the natural resources of the Sierra Nevada for future generations while promoting sustainable communities. The organization is an Alliance of conservation groups that are based or work in the Sierra Nevada region. There are over eighty-five Member Groups that span the entire 400 mile mountain range. The Sierra Nevada Alliance unites individuals and groups behind a common vision. The Alliance envisions a Sierra where natural and human communities coexist in harmony. A Sierra where residents and visitors alike understand and value the unique qualities of the range and protect the places they love.
