Established in 1946, Freedom from Hunger is an international development organization that brings innovative and sustainable self-help solutions to the fight against chronic hunger and poverty. Freedom from Hunger combines microfinance with health and education services to equip very poor families to improve their incomes, safeguard their health and achieve lasting food security. To implement and expand our programs sustainably, we collaborate with a network of more than 150 local organizations in 24 countries throughout the developing world. Freedom from Hunger is currently reaching 5.7 million people and benefiting a total of over 29 million!
