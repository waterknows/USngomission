Founded in 1977, the Government Accountability Project (GAP) is the nation's leading whistleblower organization. GAP promotes accountability by advocating occupational free speech, litigating whistleblower cases, publicizing whistleblower concerns, and developing policy and legal reforms of whistleblower laws. GAP's mission is to protect the public interest by promoting government and corporate accountability through advancing occupational free speech and ethical conduct, defending whistleblowers, and empowering citizen activists. GAP's major program initiatives focus on both government and corporate accountability related to nuclear oversight, food and drug safety, worker health and safety, international reform and national security.
