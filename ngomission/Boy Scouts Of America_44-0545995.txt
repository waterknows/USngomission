The mission of the Boy Scouts of America, Heart of America Council, is to prepare the young people of eastern Kansas and western Missouri to make ethical choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Scout Law. The vision of the Council is to as to be recognized by our public as the premiere youth organization in the communities we serve. In addition, we want to be recognized by other BSA councils and the National Council as second to none in all endeavors, and setting the standard in all measurable items.
