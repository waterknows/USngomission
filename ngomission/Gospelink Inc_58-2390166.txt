The vision of Gospelink is to provide as many people as possible the opportunity to hear about Jesus Christ and to help them to grow spiritually by empowering national preachers. While Gospelink's primary mission is to advance the Gospel by assisting national preachers, we have other initiatives which are bearing fruit. The sponsorship program links believers with resources with national preachers, Bible College students, and Orphans that lack them. The International Bible College of Zambia is providing a quality education and ministry training to young men and women in Africa (at no cost to them). Finally, the Malawi Project is training national preachers and caring for orphans.
