PATH Beyond Shelter is a family of agencies working together to end homelessness for individuals, families, and communities throughout Southern California. We strive to do this by prioritizing housing while providing customized supportive services for people in need. Our agencies each address homelessness in a different way—supportive services, permanent housing development, support for homeless families, and community engagement—all of which ultimately help the people we serve make it home.
