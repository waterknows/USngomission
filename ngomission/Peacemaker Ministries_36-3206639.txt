Founded in 1982, the mission of Peacemaker Ministries is to equip and assist Christians and their churches to respond to conflict biblically by developing and delivering outstanding, life-changing resources, training, and services to a multitude of receptive churches throughout the world. We prepare church leaders, adults, and children for peacemaking through educational resources, seminars, and training. We also provide conflict coaching, mediation, and arbitration services to resolve church and ministry disputes, lawsuits, family divisions, and business conflicts.
