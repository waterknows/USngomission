Tribe of Judah Motorcycle Ministries International, also known as River of God Church International, is an evangelistic ministry reaching the outlaw biker world and people in all walks of life. On May 11, 1980, Ben Priest met Jesus Christ as his personal Lord and Savior on the streets of Houston, Texas. After living many years in rebellion as an outlaw biker addicted to drugs and alcohol, Ben prayed and Jesus saved Ben and filled him with the Holy Ghost. Ben was sent forth to evangelize the outlaw biker world, a segment of society not ordinarily reached with the Gospel. Ben has ministered the life-transforming Gospel message in churches, schools, and youth rallies, as well as drug rehabilitation centers and prisons all over the world.
