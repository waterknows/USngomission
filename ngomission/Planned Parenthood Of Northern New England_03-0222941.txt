Planned Parenthood of Northern New England (PPNNE) is the largest reproductive health care and sexuality education provider and advocate in northern New England. PPNNE was founded in 1965 and has 21 health centers across Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. In 2015 , PPNNE served approximately 40,000 patients, and subsidized $7.4 million in services for people who can't afford the full cost of their care. We work to provide, promote, and protect access to reproductive health care and sexuality education so that all people can make voluntary choices about their reproductive and sexual health.
