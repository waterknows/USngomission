Incorporated in 1972, Listen Community Services provides services and support to meet the critical needs

of Upper Valley individuals and families. Our grassroots organization has grown along with the region; adding programs like Community Dinners, Summer Camp Scholarships and Heating Helpers, to meet emerging needs. As a direct result of our community's generosity, Upper Valley children, seniors, families and individuals receive a warm meal, fuel for their homes, holiday presents for their children, and life skills education to help them transition to successful independent living.
