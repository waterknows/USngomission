The mission of OUR HOUSE Grief Support Center is to provide the Los Angeles community with grief support services, education, resources and hope. Our programs serve adults, teens, and children as young as four years old. OUR HOUSE provides essential grief support for a universal experience that is still misunderstood and taboo in our society.OUR HOUSE recognizes that each person's grief is unique in its endurance and intensity, and that commonalities of experience strengthen the value of a grief support group in helping to resolve the symptoms of grief. OUR HOUSE is comprised of five core programs:(1) Grief Support Groups for Children & Adults (2) School-Based Grief Groups (3) Camp Erin Los Angeles (4) Professional Education (5) Community Grief Response
