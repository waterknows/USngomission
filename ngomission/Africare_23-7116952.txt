Founded in 1970, Africare, a leader among organizations assisting Africa, has more projects on the continent than any other U.S.-based charity. Africare works to improve the quality of life for the people of Africa. Our programs address needs in four principal areas: health and HIV/AIDS, food security and agriculture, water and sanitation, and emergency and humanitarian assistance. Africare places communities at the center of development in the belief that only through strong communities can Africa feed itself, develop and manage its natural resources, provide adequate education and vocational training, address people's needs for health care and disease prevention, achieve economic well-being and live in peace. Since its founding, Africare has delivered well over $800 million in assistance - over 2,500 projects - to 36 countries Africa-wide.
