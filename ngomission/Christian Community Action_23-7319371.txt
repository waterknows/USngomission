In the spirit of Jesus Christ, Christian Community Action (CCA) ministers to the poor by providing comprehensive services that alleviate suffering, bring hope, and change lives. When a family is hungry, tired and has no place to go, it is hard for them to help themselves. Since 1973, Christian Community Action has been feeding, sheltering, educating and training families in need within 42 communities throughout Collin, Dallas, Denton, Tarrant and Wise counties. In one year, CCA assists more than 12,000 individuals. We distribute more than $1.4 million of food and see more than 4,000 low-income patients in our health center each year. We have more than 1,660 people taking educational and vocational training programs at our facility annually.
