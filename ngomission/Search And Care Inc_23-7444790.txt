Search and Care's mission is to seek out older people in the community who need help in managing life's daily activities or accessing essential services, and to provide them the support and companionship they require to live with security and dignity in the manner they choose. For 42 years, Search and Care's hallmark is providing elders with compassionate and personalized comprehensive care, that also manages to be cost effective (on average less than $1,500 per client, per year). Many of our clients are frail, and often low income, isolated and homebound. Accepting the help of Search and Care is often preferred over the necessity to relocate to an alternative housing setting such as assisted, enriched, or nursing facilities. We serve clients who live in Yorkville, Carnegie Hill and East Harlem.
