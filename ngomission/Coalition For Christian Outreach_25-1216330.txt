Founded in 1971, the Coalition for Christian Outreach (CCO) is a campus ministry that partners with churches, colleges and other organizations to develop men and women who live out their Christian faith in every area of life. Our ministry is transformational. We challenge the students we serve to submit every area of their lives to Jesus Christ. We partner with churches, colleges and other organizations, placing our staff in strategic positions of influence on campus. Some of our staff people serve as an arm of the local church on campus, while others work as residence hall directors, coaches or student activities directors. We do contextual ministry, meaning that our staff people adjust to the needs of the particular campus at which they serve. No two CCO ministries look exactly alike.
