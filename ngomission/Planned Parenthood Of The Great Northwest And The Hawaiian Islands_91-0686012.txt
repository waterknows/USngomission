Planned Parenthood of the Great Northwest (PPGNW) was formed in November, 2008 with the merger of Planned Parenthood's of Alaska, Idaho, and Western Washington, creating the largest geographic affiliate in Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Today, PPGNW is the region's leading sexual and reproductive health care provider and advocate. We believe everyone has the right to choose when or whether to have a child, and that every child should be wanted and loved. PPGNW operates health centers in Alaska, Idaho, and western Washington, providing medical services and sexuality education for thousands of women, men, and teenagers each year.
