Founded in 1992, BELL (Building Educated Leaders for Life) exists to transform the academic achievements, self-confidence, and life trajectories of children living in low-income, urban communities. Because we believe in the tremendous potential of all children to excel, we recognize them as scholars. We pursue our mission by expanding learning time in the summer and after school. BELL programs feature small-group instruction in literacy and math with research-based and multicultural curricula, positive adult role models to build self-esteem and respect for others, a wide range of enrichment experiences, and experiential learning through guest speakers, field trips and service projects. BELL currently serve 15,000 scholars annually in partnership with schools and school districts in Boston & Springfield (MA), Baltimore (MD), Detroit (MI), Newark (NJ), New York (NY), Charlotte & Winston-Salem (NC), Spartanburg (SC), and San Jose & San Rafael (CA).
