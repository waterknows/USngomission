The Tipitina's Foundation, established in 2003, has worked diligently to uplift the music community of Louisiana. The mission of the Tipitina's Foundation is to support Louisiana and New Orleans' irreplaceable music community and preserve the state's unique musical cultures. The history of the Tipitina's Foundation originates from the Tipitina's music venue, a revered New Orleans cultural icon that continues to be instrumental in the development and promotion of Louisiana music around the world. The Foundation works to support childhood music education, the professional development of adult musicians, and the increased profile and viability of Louisiana music as a cultural, educational, and economic resource.
