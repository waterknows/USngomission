Founded in 2002, HeartWorks is a 501Â©(3) nonprofit community service agency in Bayboro, North Carolina. Our mission is to address the underserved mental and physical health needs of youth and their families in Pamlico County and surrounding areas. Education is the cornerstone of our efforts. Nurturing is our method. Our programming includes academic lessons, life skills development, the promotion of positive physical and mental health, and family advocacy. By providing children and their families with affordable and effective resources in these areas we at HeartWorks can achieve our overall goal of promoting a community that serves as the shelter of each other.
