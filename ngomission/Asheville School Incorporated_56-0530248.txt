Asheville School works to prepare our students for college and for life, and to provide an atmosphere in which all members of a diverse, engaged, and purposefully small school community appreciate and strive for excellence - an atmosphere which nurtures character and fosters the development of mind, body, and spirit. Asheville School was founded in 1900 by Charles Andrews Mitchell and Newton Mitchell Anderson. Their concept for Asheville School was of a place where boys could prepare for college or for the business world; where the body, through organized athletics, would be trained as well as the brain; where boys could learn constructive work with their hands as well as their heads. Our school motto, Vitae Excelsioris Limen, translates to "threshold for a higher life."
