Since 1930, CBMC (Christian Business Men's Committee) International has been used by God to reach leaders in the global marketplace, perhaps the most difficult mission field in the world. We are an international network of business and professional persons who are actively engaged in ministry to reach the influencers of the world's nations and cultures. CBMC International has grown to an active global ministry on six continents in more than 80 countries. CBMC International serves and supports those national ministries by equipping and engaging key leaders in the organization.
