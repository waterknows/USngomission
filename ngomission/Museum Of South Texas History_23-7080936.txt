The Museum of South Texas History first opened its doors in 1967 as the Hidalgo County Historical Museum in the old Hidalgo County jail. The mission of the Museum of South Texas History is to preserve and present the borderland heritage of South Texas and Northeastern Mexico. In 2003 the Museum completed a $5.5 million expansion, including a 22,500 square foot wing that includes the Museum Store, Grand Lobby, and permanent exhibits. As part of the 2003 expansion, the Museum installed the first two sections of the Rio Grande Legacy. This permanent exhibit sequence, with bilingual text and state of the art displays, takes visitors on a journey through the prehistory and history of the region.
