The Minnesota Indian Women's Resource Center (MIWRC) is a social and educational services organization committed to the holistic growth and development of American Indian women and their families. Founded in 1984, MIWRC provides a broad range of programs designed to educate and empower American Indian women and their families, and to inform and assist those who work providing services to the community. Our mission is to empower American Indian women and families to exercise their cultural values and integrity, and to achieve sustainable life ways, while advocating for justice and equity. MIWRC is located in the Phillips neighborhood of Minneapolis, which has the third largest urban American Indian population in the United States. MIWRC is the only organization addressing the gender and culturally specific needs of our community.
