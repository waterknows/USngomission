The Wild Animal Sanctuary was founded in Boulder, Colorado in 1980, and has been operating for more than 35 years. The refuge is open to supporters daily, and is run by staff and volunteers. The Wild Animal Sanctuary is one of only a handful of true sanctuaries for abused and abandoned great cats and bears in the United States, where the animals are not bred, sold, or otherwise commercially exploited in any way. The Sanctuary is located on the plains of Colorado northeast of the Denver Metro area. Comprising 720 acres and sheltering more than 400 lions, tigers, bears, leopards, mountain lions, wolves and other large carnivores, it is the largest carnivore sanctuary in the world and the only sanctuary providing large acreage (5 to 25 acres each) species-specific habitats for its rescued animals.
