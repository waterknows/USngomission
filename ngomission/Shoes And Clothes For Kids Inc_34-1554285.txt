Founded in 1969, Shoes and Clothes for Kids (SC4K) is the only non-profit organization in Greater Cleveland providing new shoes and clothes at no charge throughout the year to thousands of children in need. Through a network of 35 Distribution Partners, SC4K positively impacts the lives of area children by giving them the self-esteem and confidence that comes from having brand new shoes and clothes. 



SC4K is proud to serve as a change agent for area families living in poverty. The offering of shoe gift cards and free clothing also brings families into our Distribution Partners' agencies that would not normally come through the door. Once at the agency, families are able to access additional programs and services working to improve and enrich their lives. These programs include food pantries, GED education programs, resale shops, job placement, Head Start, daycare, immunization, etc.
