Junior Achievement of Utah was established in 1956 to educate Utah's students in work readiness, entrepreneurship and financial literacy through experiential, hands-on programs. JA programs help prepare young people for the real world by showing them how to generate wealth and effectively manage it, how to create jobs which make their communities more robust and how to apply entrepreneurial thinking to the workplace. JA of Utah reaches students with three distinct approaches: Our In-class programs for grades K-12, our experiential learning site, JA City, offered to 5th and 8th grade students, and our City Career Exploration Center in JA City, open to the public, to provide career exploration for all ages.
