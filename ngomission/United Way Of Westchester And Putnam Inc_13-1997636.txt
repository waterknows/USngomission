The mission of the United Way of Westchester and Putnam is to advance the common good. With your help we can create opportunities for a better life by focusing on a quality education that leads to a better job which provides income that can support a family through retirement and good health. Everything we do supports these building blocks for a better life--and that affects all of us.

United Way tackles complex problems by figuring out what's causing them, then building community teams--experts in non-profit, business, government and educational communities--to find ways to overcome them. The goal is to produce lasting change.
