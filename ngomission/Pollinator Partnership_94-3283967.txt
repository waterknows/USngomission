The Pollinator Partnership is the largest organization working to protect the health of managed and native pollinating animals vital to our North American ecosystems and agriculture. The Pollinator Partnership (P2) website is a premiere source of information for consumers, gardeners, land managers, educators, resource managers, producers, and farmers to help pollinators, essential components for all of life. As one of its many projects, P2 manages the North American Pollinator Protection Campaign, a collaborative group of over 120 organizations and individuals that promote and implement a continent-wide action plan to encourage activities to protect the numbers and health of all pollinating animals.
