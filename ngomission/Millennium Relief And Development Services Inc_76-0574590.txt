Houston-based Millennium Relief & Development Services is a network of international development centers and field workers who live long-term among the people they serve. These workers speak the local language and are experts in the local culture. By listening to and understanding the needs of the people, field workers design social investment projects to help solve human problems at the local level. Our projects focus health and social services, micro-economic development, education, disaster relief and assistance, and consulting services.
