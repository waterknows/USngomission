Yo-Yo Ma founded the nonprofit organization Silkroad in 1998. The Silk Road Ensemble was formed in 2000 as a way of bringing together innovative performers and composers representing traditions from around the world. Silkroad is a collective of rooted explorers, inclusive independents, storytelling musicians, passionate learners, connected nomads, and cultural entrepreneurs. We believe that exploring our differences enriches our humanity. We seek the edge where education, business, and the arts come together to spark new ways of looking at the world. We strive to create unexpected connections, collaborations, and communities in pursuit of meaningful change.
