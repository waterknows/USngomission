The SPCA of Texas is a one of the oldest and largest comprehensive animal welfare organizations in Texas with locations in both Dallas and McKinney. It operates two animal care and adoption centers and three low-cost care clinics that provide spay/neuter surgeries, vaccinations and preventative healthcare services to the public. On-staff veterinary teams, animal behaviorists and an active corps of volunteers care for all animals brought in through seizure, transfer or owner-surrender until adoption. The Animal Cruelty Investigations Unit collaborates with local law enforcement and investigates reports of cruelty and neglect over a six county area. The Education Department offers a variety of humane education programming for children through camps, workshops, tours and school visits.
