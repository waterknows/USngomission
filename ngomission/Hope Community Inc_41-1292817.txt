Founded in 1977, Hope Community is a catalyst for change, growth and safety. We are building a sustainable neighborhood model through community organization, active education, leadership and affordable housing development. To do this, we develop affordable housing and public spaces, including a community center, playgrounds and gardens. Additionally, we engage with the community extensively to involve hundreds of youth, adults and families each year in learning, leadership and community opportunities.
