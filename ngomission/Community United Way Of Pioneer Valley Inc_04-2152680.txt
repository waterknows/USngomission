The United Way of Pioneer Valley mobilizes people and resources to strengthen our communities. We envision a thriving, caring region where individuals have opportunities to realize their human potential, are economically self-sufficient and contribute collectively to improve the quality of life in their communities. United Way targets its strategies at those critical passages in people's lives that determine what the future will hold for them as individuals and for their families and communities. This approach maximizes United Way's effectiveness, because it allows us to improve lives not just in the short term, and not just on the surface, but in a lasting and meaningful way that benefits the entire region.
