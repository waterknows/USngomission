Our mission is to be the presence of Jesus Christ, sharing his life-transforming hope, love, and power among distressed families of urban Phoenix to ignite their passion for God and His Kingdom. Our outreach programs meet our community's most basic needs including food and clothing and youth programs. Our empowerment programs provide case management, academic support, and workforce development. Neighborhood Ministries is a great place for urban mission opportunities for individuals, churches, and other groups.
