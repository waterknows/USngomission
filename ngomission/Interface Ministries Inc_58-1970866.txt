InterFACE (iFace) Ministries is a nonprofit educational, Christian organization which networks international students and scholars with culturally sensitive Americans who enjoy cross-cultural friendships and the open exchange of ideas. Just as computers need to interface in order to communicate, we from around the world should be encouraged to connect with one another to learn more about our world and our Creator. International students can count on InterFACE to provide a wide variety of activities to satisfy their specialized interests.
