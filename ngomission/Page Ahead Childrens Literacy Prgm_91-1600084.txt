Founded in 1990 as Books for Kids, the name was changed to Page Ahead in 2001. Guided by the fact that literacy is essential to lifelong success, Page Ahead provides new books and develops reading activities that empower at-risk children. Serving children from primarily low-income families, Page Ahead collaborates with elementary schools, tutoring programs, Head Start and other preschool programs, tribal libraries, migrant centers, homeless shelters and teen parenting programs across Washington State to improve the reading and language skills of at-risk children. The Book Distribution program provides up to three new books per child each year, the Family Involvement program educates and encourages parents to read with their children, and the Community Involvement Program creates lasting community support for reading programs by holding book drives.
