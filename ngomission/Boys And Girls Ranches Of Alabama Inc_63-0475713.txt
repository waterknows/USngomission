The Alabama Sheriffs' Youth Ranches works to provide Christian, family-style residential homes for Alabama's needy, neglected, or abused, school-age children in an atmosphere where they may grow spiritually and physically into productive, responsible, and happy adults. The Ranches are actual working Ranches and require participation from the children in livestock care, farm work and lawn care. The children attend church and schools in their local communities and are encouraged to participate in extracurricular activities such as youth groups, sports and clubs. The Ranches provide each child with caregivers and a structured living environment where the children receive love, stability and a safe place to call "home."
