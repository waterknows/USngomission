Founded in 2002, Symphony Silicon Valley has progressed from daring idea to exciting reality, rapidly becoming the greater South Bay's premiere orchestra and a notable community success story. The Symphony subscription season includes seven program sets of two or three concerts each, plus other programs such as December's Carols in the California, and additional concerts by the Symphony Silicon Valley Chorale. In addition to its regular subscription concerts, the Symphony produces free outreach programs for thousands of our community's children each season. It accompanies many Ballet San Jose performances, and performs for other community events that range from San Jose State University's recent 150th Anniversary Gala Concert to concerts of music and visuals from popular video games.
