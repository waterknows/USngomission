The Julian Center is an agency providing counseling, safe shelter, and education for survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, and other life crises. Through outreach and consultation, we also seek to educate the community about the issue of domestic violence and its impact on all our lives. Since 1975, women have chosen The Julian Center as a source of strength and a place of refuge in dealing with life's challenges. Our programs and services are designed to contribute to a significant reduction in the incidence of violence against women and their children, to support survivors in healing, and to help break the intergenerational cycle of abuse.
