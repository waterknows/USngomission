A Contemporary Theatre (ACT) brings the best in contemporary theatre to Seattle's most discerning and daring audiences. It is what we do. Since 1965, ACT has probed cultural boundaries, tackled social issues and penetrated hearts. ACT made history as the first theatre in Seattle dedicated to producing contemporary plays, and we're still making history as the most welcoming development house for new plays around. With our multiple stages and diversity of work, ACT keeps you intimately involved with new theatre. From its original base of 300 subscribers, ACT has grown into a nationally recognized theatre serving nearly 8,000 subscribers. Since 1998, six of ACT's world premiere plays have gone on to New York as ACT productions.
