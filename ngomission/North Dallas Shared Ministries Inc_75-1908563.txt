North Dallas Shared Ministry works to help low-income people assume as much responsibility for their lives as they are able. Our four main goals are to: provide appropriate emergency assistance; help them access entitlement, health and community programs designed to help them achieve long-term stability; we promote their wellness and financial independence; and develop resource materials that can lead them to additional services and support. Since our founding in 1983, our corps of volunteers has grown to over 400, and we have served 33,151 people.
