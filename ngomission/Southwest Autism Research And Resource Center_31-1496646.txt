Established in 1997, the Southwest Autism Research & Resource Center's (SARRC) mission is to advance research and provide a lifetime of support for individuals with autism and their families. SARRC undertakes self-directed research, serves as a satellite site for national and international projects and provides up-to-date information, training and assistance to families and professionals about autism. Through integrative research, educational outreach, model programs and collaborative initiatives, SARRC sets forth, promotes and facilitates best practices for early intervention and the long-term care of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). In 2012, SARRC provided more than 1,200 individualized services to children, teens, and adults with ASD; served nearly 3,000 parents, family members, typical peers, and community members; and trained more than 3,300 educational and medical professionals.
