The ACLU of Massachusetts exists to defend and promote the principle of "liberty and justice for ALL!" A private, voluntary, nonpartisan organization, we use integrated litigation, legislative advocacy, education and organizing strategies to defend and preserve the rights and liberties guaranteed by the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights and the U.S. Constitution.We protect your civil liberties: your rights to freedom of speech, association and assembly, and to religious liberty. We protect the freedom of the press. We work to ensure that you have the right to equal treatment under the law and the right to due process, and that you are free from unwarranted government intrusion into your private life.We also fight discrimination and to uphold civil rights. We are here for everyone, working to ensure that all people in the Commonwealth are treated with equality and fairness -- because if the rights of society's most vulnerable members are denied, everyone's rights are imperiled.
