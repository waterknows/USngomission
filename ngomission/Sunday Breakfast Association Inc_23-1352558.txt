Sunday Breakfast Rescue Mission is the third oldest Rescue Mission in the country. Founded in 1878, we have reached out to the homeless in Philadelphia for 130 years. Sunday Breakfast Rescue Mission meets the physical, spiritual, emotional and social needs of homeless and disadvantaged people in the Philadelphia area. It is our desire to meet the immediate needs of our clients and to create a therapeutic environment which inspires real life changes that will lead them to restoration and rehabilitation. To this end, we have developed ministries to address the specific needs of clients in their individual circumstances and help them gain perspective and purpose in their lives.
