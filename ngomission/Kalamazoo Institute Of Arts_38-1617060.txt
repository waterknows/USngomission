From its beginning in 1924, the Kalamazoo Institute of Arts (KIA) has offered art classes to the whole community and a place for the enjoyment of the visual arts through exhibitions, lectures, special events and a permanent collection. The KIA's mission is to cultivate the creation and appreciation of the visual arts for the communities of West Michigan. The museum's 10 galleries showcase outstanding temporary exhibitions and the KIA's significant permanent collection. While the collection's emphasis is 20th-century American painting and sculpture, it also includes a European and American print collection, as well as important collections of photography and contemporary ceramics. The collection includes works by local, national, and international artists.
