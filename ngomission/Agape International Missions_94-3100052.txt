Agape International Missions (AIM) was founded on the ground in Cambodia in 1988 as a humanitarian aid and church planting organization in Cambodia. Since 2005, our ministries have focused on ending the evil of child sexual slavery. AIM's mission is to rescue, restore and reintegrate survivors of sex trafficking through Christ's love and Gospel and to prevent sexual slavery by planting and equipping the Church to do the same in vulnerable and exploited communities worldwide.
