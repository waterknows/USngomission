Founded in 1958, Young Audiences of Oregon & SW Washington has evolved from presenting only a few classical music performances to currently providing a roster of over 200 skilled residency and performing artists with programs in multiple artistic disciplines and cultures. We connect these artists with classroom teachers and together they use the arts to make learning come alive for their students. Our mission is to enhance children's learning with creative resources from the arts community. Through Young Audiences' Run For The Arts, schools raise the funds that make it possible to bring artists into their classrooms, pay for field trips to see performances and exhibitions and purchase art supplies.
