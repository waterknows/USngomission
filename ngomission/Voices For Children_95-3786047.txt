Voices for Children (VFC) transforms the lives of abused children in San Diego County by providing them with volunteer Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASAs). 



We believe that every child deserves a safe and permanent home, and to that end, will provide a CASA to every child in the foster care system who needs one, monitor every court file in the system, and advocate to improve the lives of San Diego County's foster children. 



VFC pursues its mission and vision through the advocacy of highly trained volunteer CASAs, who diligently monitor cases. In this way, VFC ensures that judges have the most thorough, current information possible when making decisions about such issues as a foster child's living situation, visits with siblings, medical and educational needs, and other services. By all accounts, CASAs make a huge difference in the foster care system; they give San Diego's foster children the opportunity to live up to his or her potential.
