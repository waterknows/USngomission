Food Finders was founded in 1989 by Arlene Mercer, who was concerned about the amount of food being thrown away rather than donated by local food merchants and grocers. Inspired to end the waste, she began forming liaisons with local vendors and seeking shelters that could use good, wholesome food to feed needy and impoverished families, children and elderly. Food Finders was quickly formed, and from there the kitchen-table business grew into what is now a multi-regional food bank that helps provide daily meals to more than 280 agencies and shelters throughout Southern California. Food Finders, which has grown to 9 employees and more than 300 volunteers, has rescued more than 121 million pounds of food to date, in addition to referring thousands of families to local shelters and agencies where meals are provided.
