Founded in 1957, the Delaware Humane Association (DHA) acts as a voice for companion animals and enhances their welfare by providing temporary shelter, spay/neuter services, humane education programs, and adoption/placement resources. Each year, hundreds of animals come to DHA in search of a warm bed, a good meal, and most importantly, a new home. Staff members go the extra mile to prepare each dog or cat for a new home by keeping them well-groomed, giving them daily exercise and affection, providing obedience training and any necessary medical care. In addition, DHA hosts a number of programs which benefit the community, including rabies clinics, educational workshops, pet therapy, and an affordable spay/neuter program.
