Rancho Coastal Humane Society (RCHS) was formed in 1960 by a group of hardworking volunteers, led by animal lover Maria K. Lloyd. The goal was and continues to be to care for the homeless animal population of San Diego County and to educate the public about pet overpopulation and responsible companion animal care. RCHS provides quality shelter care, adoption services, education programs and an animal safehouse program for the survivors of domestic violence. One of RCHS' main goals is the adoption of animals to permanent, loving homes. RCHS' adoption process is tailored to find the best match between pets and people. After finding the perfect match, we help prospective adopters learn about health care, nutrition requirements, grooming, exercise, responsible pet ownership, socialization and the importance of the human/animal bond.
