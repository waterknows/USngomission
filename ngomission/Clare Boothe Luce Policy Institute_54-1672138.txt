The Clare Boothe Luce Policy Institute is one of the most unique organizations in America. Founded in 1993, our mission is to prepare women for effective leadership and to promote leading conservative women. Through our various student programs, we strive to engage, inform, and connect conservative women across the country. By providing them with the resources, role models, and encouragement they need, we help students prepare for future success in their workplace, school, and community. We promote mentors and women leaders who are committed to constitutional principles such as individual freedom, economic liberty, limited government, personal responsibility, and traditional values.
