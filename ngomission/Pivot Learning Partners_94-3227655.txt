Pivot Learning Partners is a non-profit organization of K-12 experts whose mission is to revitalize public education by developing the leaders and building the education organizations of the future. We envision a future in which race, class, language, gender and culture are no longer good predictors of educational outcomes for students. We work directly with schools, districts and charters to address some of the biggest challenges they face, including how to raise student achievement and close the large achievement gaps between groups of children. Unlike consultants that simply prepare elaborate blueprints and then depart, we provide the strategic vision for reform and the on-the-ground training and implementation support needed to ensure that transformational change happens.
