The mission of Second Harvest Food Bank of Middle Tennessee is to feed hungry people and work to solve hunger issues in our community. Approximately 600,000 people in 46 Tennessee counties receive food from SHFB each year. Food is distributed through not-for-profit agencies such as senior centers, treatment facilities, low-income day care centers, and food pantries. SHFB operates an Emergency Food Box program in Davidson County that helps individuals and families with emergency food needs. SHFB's Children's Feeding Programs provide low-income children with a nutritious evening meal or a BackPack bag of food for the weekend when school meals are not available. The Middle Tennessee's Table program rescues food products from grocery stores and distributes them to partner agencies in our 46-county service area. The Project Preserve Program produces and brokers millions of pounds of food for distribution to agencies in Middle Tennessee as well as to food banks across the country.
