Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) uses high-impact legal actions to target government officials who sacrifice the common good to special interests. At CREW, we believe politicians must be held accountable for their actions. Day in and day out, we work to ensure government officials - regardless of party affiliation - act with honesty and integrity and merit the public trust. CREW accomplishes this by marrying in-depth research and investigation with hard-charging legal action and an aggressive communications strategy. We augment these efforts by building coalitions to push for policies favoring transparency and accountability. To garner support for our efforts, we use all mediums of the modern media - television, radio, print, and social networking - to maximize coverage of our work.
