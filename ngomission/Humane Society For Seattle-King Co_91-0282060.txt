Seattle Humane,founded in 1897, brings people and pets together to enrich each others lives. Practicing a no kill philosophy, they save companion animals' lives and place these formerly abandoned pets in homes of their own. Both the animals and humans benefit. Seattle Humane places loving dogs, cats and other small companion animals in homes of their own no matter how long it takes. They provide shelter related services for any companion animal in King County who needs help. In addition, Seattle Humane operates a spay/neuter clinic, education/community outreach and youth tours, and Summer Adventure Camp for Kids, among others.
