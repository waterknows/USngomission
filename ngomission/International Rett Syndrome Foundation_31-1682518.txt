The International Rett Syndrome Foundation (IRSF) was established in July 2007 through the strategic merger of the Rett Syndrome Research Foundation and the International Rett Syndrome Association. IRSF funds research for treatments and a cure for Rett syndrome while enhancing the overall quality of life for those living with Rett syndrome by providing information, programs, and services. IRSF coordinates, cultivates, accelerates, and funds research that will produce a cure for Rett syndrome and reveal and develop treatments that will make the lives of people living with Rett syndrome richer and free of pain and discomfort. IRSF also assists families of individuals living with Rett syndrome and advocates for and raises awareness about individuals with Rett Syndrome.
