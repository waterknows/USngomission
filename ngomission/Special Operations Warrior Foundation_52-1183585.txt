The Special Operations Warrior Foundation (SOWF) was founded in 1980 to provide support and assistance to the U. S. military's special operations community, which consist Army Special Forces (Green Berets), the Army's 75th Ranger Regiment, the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, Navy Small Boat Teams, Navy SEALs, Air Force Combat Controllers, Air Force rotary and fixed wing squadrons, and Marine Corps special operations personnel. SOWF's mission includes two major aspects in support of special operations personnel: providing a full college education to the surviving children of those who lose their lives while serving in the U.S. military special operations community, and providing immediate financial assistance and support to ensure that severely wounded personnel are able to have their loved ones at their bedside during recovery.
