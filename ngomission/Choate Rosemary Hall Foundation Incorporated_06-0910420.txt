Founded in 1890, Choate Rosemary Hall is a boarding and day secondary school of 850 students from 41 states and 39 countries. Two interwoven priorities define the Choate experience: a rigorous academic curriculum and an emphasis on the formation of character in a setting that allows teachers and students to live with, and learn from, each other in important ways. The curriculum prepares students to seek knowledge for its own sake and to pursue further study at the finest colleges and universities. In classrooms, on playing fields, and in residential houses, students are instilled with such fundamental values as honesty, integrity, team work, generosity, and compassion toward others.
