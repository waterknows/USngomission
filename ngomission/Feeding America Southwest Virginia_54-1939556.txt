Since 1981, the Feeding America Southwestern Virginia (formerly Southwestern Virginia Second Harvest Food Bank) has provided millions of pounds of food and related product to approximately 340 partner agencies that directly serve the families and individuals in need of emergency food assistance. Our partner agencies include nonprofit food pantries, children's feeding programs, shelters, soup kitchens, and elderly care facilities. We strive to serve, at the lowest cost possible, hungry people - children, adults, the elderly, and the less fortunate by any definition - by collaborating with an ever-widening network of nonprofit and faith-based food distribution agencies throughout our 26-county service area.
