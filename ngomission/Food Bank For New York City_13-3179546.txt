The Food Bank For New York City was founded in 1983 to address the growing needs of people seeking emergency food assistance in New York City. Food Bank For New York City recognizes 25 years as the city's major hunger-relief organization. Working to end food poverty and increase access to affordable, nutritious food for low-income New Yorkers throughout the five boroughs, the Food Bank's initiatives focus on direct services, food sourcing and distribution, nutrition and health education, financial empowerment, disaster relief and policy and research. The Food Bank procures and distributes food to a network of approximately 1,000 food assistance programs citywide.
