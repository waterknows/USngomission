Philadelphia Futures: a union of White-Williams Scholars and Philadelphia Futures provides Philadelphia's low-income, first-generation-to-college students with the tools, resources and opportunities necessary for admission to and success in college. Working with volunteer mentors, donors, and school and college personnel in direct service to students, in partnership with educational institutions, and in advocacy activities in the broader community, Philadelphia Futures increases the percentage of Philadelphia graduates prepared for higher education, while simultaneously reducing the institutional barriers to their academic success. Philadelphia Futures operates on the belief that a college education is the portal to economic self-sufficiency and a satisfying life.
