Greater Cleveland Habitat for Humanity (GCHFH), a Christian-based organization, develops opportunities for all God's people to act out their faith. By working in partnerships to eliminate substandard housing, we enable families and volunteers to improve lives. We create hope by building homes, strengthening neighborhoods and reweaving communities. Habitat offers qualified families, with demonstrated need, willingness to partner, and the ability to pay a zero-interest loan, an opportunity to build and buy a home. We bring urban and suburban communities together to eliminate poverty housing and homelessness from the world, and to make decent shelter a matter of conscience and action.
