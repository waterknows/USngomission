Founded in 1942, Jack & Jill Children's Center works to break the cycle of poverty for children of lower income working families in Broward County through family-oriented child care services and family intervention and support. Our accredited program supports the intellectual, emotional, physical and social development of young children. Jack & Jill now serves 170 children ages birth to five years old in our new, state-of-the-art Halmos Family Building. Our core program includes: high quality year round child care accredited by NAEYC; free, hot nutritious breakfast, lunch and snack daily for the children; skill building and job training workshops for parents; family literacy program including a lending library; preventative health care and education; and food and clothing banks.
