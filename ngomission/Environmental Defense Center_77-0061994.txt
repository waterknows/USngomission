The Environmental Defense Center (EDC) protects and enhances the local environment through education, advocacy, and legal action. Since 1977 they have empowered community based organizations to advance environmental protection. Their program areas include protecting coast and ocean resources, open spaces and wildlife, and human and environmental health. EDC provides legal counsel to other nonprofit organizations. They remain the only such public interest environmental law firm between Los Angeles and San Francisco, and thrive on the support of community members from within their region and beyond.
