Founded in 1978, Friendship Trays delivers about 750 meals daily to elderly, handicapped, and convalescing people who are unable or greatly restricted in their ability to prepare or secure meals and who reside within the area we can reach with our corps of drivers. This meal consists of two separate containers, one with meat or fish, vegetable and such, the other with carbohydrate and dessert. Also included is a container of milk or juice. Diet orders are obtained for all clients from their doctors, and a range of special diets are available to fill doctors' written orders for certain medical conditions.
