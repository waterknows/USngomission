CRISTA Ministries, founded in 1949, delivers real-life solutions that demonstrate the transforming love and hope found in Jesus Christ to the people we serve. Our seven ministries include: alternative education (Seattle Urban Academy), broadcast, camps and conference centers, education (King's Schools), humanitarian relief and development (World Concern), senior living, and veterinary missions (Christian Veterinary Mission). In the sphere of Christian ministry, CRISTA is unique in the breadth, depth, and range of influence and assistance it provides every day, everywhere. There is one overriding desire in all of this - to bring hope to life and love people to Christ. In the years to come, by God's grace, CRISTA will touch more lives than ever with compassion, inspiration and the very best care.
