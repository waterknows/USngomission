Serving the Omaha and Council Bluffs metropolitan area since 1975, Siena/Francis House creates an environment in which people can find the motivation needed to precipitate adult behavioral change, moving in small, manageable steps. The first step is to get our guests off the streets. Next we encourage sobriety in our recovery program, a traditional 12 step recovery process. Then we move to training in social and job skills, education and self-esteem, and finally to independent living training in transitional housing. The primary goal of the Siena/Francis House is to work towards successfully ending the homeless cycle rather than providing only short-term, stop-gap treatments.
