PAWS/LA was founded in 1989 in response to the companion animal-related crises faced by residents of Los Angeles county who were financially and physically debilitated by HIV/AIDS. PAWS/LA is dedicated to preserving the loving bond between people and their companion animals. To that end, we provide services to assist low-income seniors and people disabled by a life-threatening illness keep and care for their pets.
