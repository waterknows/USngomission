Founded in 1989, HomeAid is a leading national provider of housing for today's homeless. The organization builds new lives for America's homeless families and individuals through housing and community outreach. HomeAid builds multi-unit housing for homeless families and individuals, then donates it to charities such as Boys Hope Girls Hope, Mercy House, Salvation Army, Volunteers of America, YMCA, and others. Most HomeAid housing serves people who are temporarily homeless due to circumstances beyond their control: job loss, natural disasters and other catastrophes, illness and medical problems, domestic violence, and more. HomeAid has provided housing for more than 170,000 individuals.
