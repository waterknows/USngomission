Our mission is to transform the fields of oceanography, marine science, and ocean health through a blend of cutting edge research, comprehensive educational experiences and a commitment to share our knowledge internationally. BIOS was founded in 1903 as the Bermuda Biological Station by scientists from Harvard and New York University to take advantage of Bermuda's ideal location for deep-ocean exploration and research. Having grown and diversified impressively over the past century, the objectives of BIOS today are to conduct and facilitate world-class research on the oceans and near-shore marine environments. The researchers at BIOS are committed to using their science to benefit people and communities around the world, providing resources and knowledge that can be used by government representatives, environmental management officials, community leaders, and individual citizens to make informed decisions about the global environment.
