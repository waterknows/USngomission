Founded in 1976, Animal Rescue is dedicated to those animals that are waiting for a home, or never find a home. At any one time we have approximately one hundred dogs and several hundred cats between our two locations; most of which are available for adoption. Animal Rescue services the greater Baltimore Maryland - York Pennsylvania area. Animal Rescue is a shelter for life for stray and abandoned animals. All our residents are given the best possible care to allow them to live out their natural lives. No animal is put to death because of medical expenses or the inconvenience of care. We also promote spay/neuter programs, and operate a Crisis Intervention Program which keeps the human/animal bond intact by providing assistance to the elderly, sick, and the infirm.
