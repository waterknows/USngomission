Founded in 1947, the Doheny Eye Institute works to further the conservation, improvement and restoration of human eyesight. Today, Doheny Eye Institute is a top-ranked research, education, and patient care group of organizations working together under an affiliation agreement between Doheny Eye Institute, and USC's Doheny Eye Medical Group and Department of Ophthalmology. Our vision is to become the premier vision research, education, and tertiary patient care eye institute in the world through the discovery of new knowledge, innovative eye care, and the education of the leaders of ophthalmology and vision science.
