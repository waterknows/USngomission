Founded in 1996, Publicolor combats the under-education and lack of job preparedness that fuel poverty by empowering students to reach their full potential in college and career. Publicolor engages high-risk students, ages 12-21, in their education through a continuum of design-based programs and academic support that counter the dropout rate.  Our students are being prepared to become engaged citizens and taxpayers, less likely to draw on public money for welfare and healthcare, and less likely to be involved in the criminal justice system. We teach the process of commercial painting to create a new community of students who work together to improve their learning environments. Our programs provide them access to tutoring, life skills and career exposure workshops, college counseling, SAT prep, credit-bearing science-based sustainability curriculum, and strong work habits.
