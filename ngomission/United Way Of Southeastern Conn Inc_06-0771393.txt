Founded in 1962, United Way of Southeastern Connecticut (UWSECT) seeks to change our community by helping people in need through responsible use of donations. At UWSECT, community investment is the work we do. It is where the money goes and how it is distributed. It is collaboration and committee work, plus it is funding of a multi-million dollar network of 71 other partner programs run at over 29 health and human service agencies. UWSECT supports an exclusive network of quality health and human service programs which work together to provide a holistic approach to a stronger community. Though all efforts are interwoven to some extent, programs are categorized as one of four target areas: community wellness, thriving children, basic needs, and economic sustainability and independence.
