Founded in 2006, the mission of the Lucy Burns Institute is to empower our audience to engage in democracy by delivering exceptionally high quality information. We believe it's our duty to ensure that interested, engaged citizens never lack access to good information. We're arming citizens with the ability to take on special interest jargon and partisan propaganda. We're making the truth about political and judicial matters accessible and empowering citizens to align their votes with their values. We're working to close the gap between what voters have and what voters want.
