Founded by Andrew Carnegie in 1895, Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh is a collection of four distinctive museums dedicated to exploration through art and science: Carnegie Museum of Art, Carnegie Museum of Natural History, Carnegie Science Center, and The Andy Warhol Museum. Collectively, the museums reached more than 1.4 million people in 2008, through exhibitions, educational programs, outreach activities, and

special events. We are the largest, most far-reaching cultural organization in the Pittsburgh region, known throughout the world for our vast art and scientific collections and our scientific research. And we're a community leader in educational outreach.
