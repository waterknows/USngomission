The Animal Rescue League Shelter and Wildlife Center (ARL) was formed in 1909 by a group of citizens who shared a concern for animal welfare and public health. Since opening its doors in 1910, the ARL has remained true to its mission "To provide temporary shelter, food, medical attention, and comfort to all abandoned, neglected and injured animals brought to us by the community; to restore lost animals to their owners or seek new homes for them, to educate the public about the humane care of animals with a goal of reducing overpopulation and to rescue and rehabilitate native Pennsylvania wildlife." The ARL helps any animal in need regardless of species or breed. At our shelter, we care for and find permanent homes for dogs, cats and other companion animals. At our Wildlife Center, we rehabilitate wildlife native to Pennsylvania that has been harmed or displaced by encounters with man. We are the ONLY shelter in the region that takes in and cares for both wild and companion animals.
