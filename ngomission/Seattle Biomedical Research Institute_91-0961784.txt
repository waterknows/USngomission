From humble beginnings as a small laboratory in Issaquah, Washington with an initial staff of five, the Center for Infectious Disease Research (formerly Seattle Biomedical Research Institute) has become the world's largest center focused solely on infectious disease research. Our mission is to make transformative scientific advancements that lead to the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases.  Throughout our 40-year history, the work performed at the Center has contributed to numerous breakthroughs advancing the science of vaccine, drug, and diagnostic discovery. Yet challenges still exist in developing effective, accessible, and reliable interventions. Success will require high-impact collaboration, innovative approaches, and cutting-edge technology, all of which are components of systems biology. Our singular focus on infectious diseases and integration of systems biology uniquely positions us as a leader in the fight against these pathogens.  With your support, we can create a healthier more hopeful world.
