Woods Hole Research Center is an independent research center dedicated to discovering and implementing solutions to climate change. We focus on the threats that pose the greatest risk to humanity, including tipping points and tropical deforestation. Our work involves satellite remote sensing, field work, modeling, and on the ground engagement in key locations around the world. Working locally and globally, we merge natural science with economics to discover sustainable paths for human prosperity and stewardship of the Earth's natural resources.
