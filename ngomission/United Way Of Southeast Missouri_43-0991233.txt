The United Way of Southeast Missouri strengthens families with a focus on education, income and health. The mission of the United Way of Southeast Missouri remains relevant: to be the leader in uniting people with resources to build a stronger and healthier community. Our Board realized, in the early 2000s, that we could better serve our mission with a defined focus on our community's most critical issues through adopting a community impact model of change for our community. Community impact is mobilizing the community to create lasting changes in community conditions that improve lives.
