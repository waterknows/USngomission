International Needs USA (IN Network USA) has been a part of the ministry of IN Network for over 35 years. The International Needs was founded in 1974, with a vision to share the gospel by partnering with Christian nationals around the world and helping them serve God in their own countries. This revolutionary concept positioned the IN Network as a pioneer in the missions arena. Presently, IN USA supports over 60 projects in 20 countries. Partnering with nationals is now an accepted standard for reaching the world with the message of Jesus Christ. IN USA touches over 10,000 people each week, while maintaining its one single focus: winning men and women, boys and girls, to Jesus Christ.
