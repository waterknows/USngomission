For more than half a century, the McNay has entranced visitors with its superb collection of modern masterworks and beautiful architecture. First opening to the public in 1954, the McNay has become one of the most distinctive museums of modern art in the nation, nearly doubling in size in 2008 with the opening of the Jane and Arthur Stieren Center for Exhibitions. Since opening five decades ago, the McNay Art Museum continues to build on an already strong collection of 19th- and 20th-century European and American paintings and sculpture by significant artists ranging from Paul CÃ©zanne, Vincent van Gogh, Auguste Rodin, Henri Matisse, and Pablo Picasso, to Edward Hopper, Georgia O'Keeffe, John Sloan, and Marsden Hartley.
