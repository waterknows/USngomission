Founded by Dr. Dian Fossey in 1978, the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International is dedicated to the conservation and protection of gorillas and their habitat in Africa. We are committed to promoting continued research on their threatened ecosystems and education about their relevance to the world in which we live. In collaboration with government agencies and other international partners, we also provide assistance to local communities through education, training and economic development initiatives. Our activities take place on many levels and places, with people from Rwanda and elsewhere in Africa, the United States, and around the world.
