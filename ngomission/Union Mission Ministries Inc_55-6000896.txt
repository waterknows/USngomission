Since 1911, Union Mission has been a ready, active hand of help to the needy of West Virginia. Our mission is "helping hurting people in Jesus' name," and as such, we unabashedly share the gospel of Jesus Christ even as we minister to the physical needs of the downtrodden. We have seen God work in amazing ways through our various ministries to improve lives and draw people closer to Him. All over our state, the Union Mission has gained a reputation of being there for those who have nowhere to turn.
