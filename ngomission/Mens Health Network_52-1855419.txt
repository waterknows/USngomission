Founded in 1992, Men's Health Network (MHN) is a national organization whose mission is to reach men and their families where they live, work, play, and pray with health prevention messages and tools, screening programs, educational materials, advocacy opportunities, and patient navigation. Our programs are provided through partnerships with religious institutions, health care providers, retailers and other private entities, fraternal organizations and workplace health programs. Our culturally sensitive educational materials accommodate various ethnic groups, addressing health concerns for specific populations.
