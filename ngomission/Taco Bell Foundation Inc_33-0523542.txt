Founded in 1992, The Taco Bell Foundation believes all young people deserve the chance to follow their dreams and reach their full potential through high school graduation. At a time when teens are unsure about their future, we are able to help support them with the resources and opportunities needed to ignite their passions and become next generation leaders. Teens are our heart and soul â€“ they are Taco Bell's customers, employees and our next generation of leaders. No issue is more important to our brand than helping America's teens succeed.
