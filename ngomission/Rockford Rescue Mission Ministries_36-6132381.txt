The Rockford Rescue Mission (RRM) shares hope and help in Jesus' name to move people from homelessness and despair toward personal and spiritual wholeness. First, the Mission meets the physical needs of our guests by providing nutritious food, safe shelter, and clothing needs. Then, the real heart of the problem -- the need for Jesus Christ in their lives, is addressed. By sharing the love and grace that only Jesus can provide, RRM is able to help our guests realize what real hope is! Finally, clients are encouraged to join the year-long life recovery program where they will receive medical and dental care, become part of an educational program to help them develop marketable skills for employment.
