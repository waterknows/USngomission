Jewish Family Service of San Diego (JFS) was founded in 1918 by a consortium of women's clubs who sought to address the myriad of human needs of the time. Today, we have grown into one of San Diego's premier human care service organizations serving more than 30,000 people annually with twelve locations throughout San Diego County and three in the Coachella Valley. Our mission is to strengthen the individual, enhance the family, and protect the vulnerable, with human services based on Jewish values. At JFS, we are one source for a lifetime of help. When a family needs help following a disaster, when a teenage mother needs parenting skills, when a family yearns to adopt a child, when a single parent can no longer make ends meet - we make a difference in people's lives. With more than 50 programs and services, we're dedicated to serving our entire community.
