Founded in 1922, United Way of Tarrant County advances the common good in Tarrant County. We believe everyone has a right to a good life and a responsibility to improve the community. We have more than 90 years of experience investing money, expertise and other resources to improve lives and communities. We establish creative collaborations of diverse individuals and organizations because together, we can accomplish more than any single group can accomplish on its own. We focus on education, income and health. Within these areas, we are especially concentrating on: child abuse and neglect, early learning and development, childhood obesity, adult literacy, senior isolation, and homelessness.
