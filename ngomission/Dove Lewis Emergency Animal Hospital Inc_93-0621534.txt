DoveLewis Emergency Animal Hospital was founded in 1973 by Mr. A.B. Lewis, in cooperation with the Portland Veterinary Medical Association, and in memory of Mr. Lewis' late wife, Dove. Dove Lewis' legacy of loving all animals, and promoting the human-animal bond lives on in the people who love and support our hospital and community programs. She is a true symbol of the human-animal bond, and the DoveLewis mission. Originally, the clinic hours were limited to evenings, weekends, and holidays to serve people and their pets when daytime clinics were traditionally closed. In June of 1992, DoveLewis opened its doors around the clock to treat animals requiring emergency and critical care, 24 hours a day. We are the only non-profit animal hospital in Portland devoted exclusively to emergency and critical care for animals 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
