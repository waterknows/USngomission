Christian Motorcyclists Association (CMA) is an interdenominational organization, dedicated to reaching people for Christ in the highways and byways through motorcycling. Since its beginning in the mid 1970's, CMA has had over 136,000 members and over 1,000 chapters in the United States. CMA is not a club, but a ministry. Our ministry team program is designed to make ministers of our members. We are involved in motorcycling events across the country and in taking the gospel of Jesus Christ into America's prisons. Our Seasons of Refreshing Conferences, conducted by CMA staff evangelists, prepare our members for ministry in the coming rally season. CMA also holds state, national, and regional rallies.
