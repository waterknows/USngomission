The Voter Participation Center (VPC) is a research-driven, results-oriented nonpartisan organization dedicated to increasing the participation and amplifying the voices of unmarried women (women who are single, widowed, divorced or separated) and other historically underrepresented groups in our democracy. The mission of the VPC is to boost the civic engagement of unmarried women, people of color and 18-29 year olds - the three demographic groups who comprise the Rising American Electorate (RAE).
