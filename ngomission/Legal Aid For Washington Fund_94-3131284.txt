Legal Aid for Washington Fund (LAW Fund) and its Campaign for Equal Justice raise charitable contributions to ensure justice is a reality - not just for those who can afford it - but for everyone in our state. Our vision is that all Washingtonians have equal access to the civil justice system and that the Washington state legal community fully embrace its responsibility to uphold this cornerstone of our democracy and view participation in the Campaign for Equal Justice as an annual tradition.
