Skid Row Housing Trust was created in 1989 by a group of business leaders and community activists concerned with an increase in the demolition of single room occupancy (SRO) hotels and what would have become the subsequent purchase of the land parcels by commercial developers. Recognizing the need to salvage the hotels so that low income and formerly homeless tenants would not be forced to return to sleeping on the City's sidewalks, the Trust quickly moved to mobilize capital to preserve the hotels as affordable housing sites. From the opening of the first property, in 1990, to the present, the Trust has developed or restored a total of 19 hotel properties comprising nearly 1,200 units of affordable housing.
