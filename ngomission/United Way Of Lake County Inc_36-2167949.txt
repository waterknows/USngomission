United Way of Lake County creates opportunities for a better life for all right here in our own community. We are a volunteer led organization that advances the common good by concentrating on three key issues that are the building blocks for a better life: education, income and health. Our work is focused on helping children and youth achieve their potential, promoting financial stability leading toward independence and improving people's health. These key issues are rooted in our three impact initiatives: Success By Six, Youth Success, and Financial Stability.
