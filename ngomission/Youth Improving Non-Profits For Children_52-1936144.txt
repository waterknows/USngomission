Founded in 1995, Youth, I.N.C. (Improving Nonprofits for Children) seeks to improve the lives of America's youth through a unique venture philanthropy model that empowers, develops, and educates nonprofit organizations serving young people. We improve the lives of kids by strengthening the organizations that serve them. Youth, I.N.C. forms long-term relationships with nonprofits and offers training, mentoring, and support to build more effective and sustainable organizations. We organize, manage, and finance events that bring nonprofits together; train nonprofit executives; provide daily coaching; and build established and influential boards of directors.
