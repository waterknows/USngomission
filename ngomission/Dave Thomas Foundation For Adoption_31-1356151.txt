The Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption is America's only nonprofit public charity dedicated exclusively to finding permanent homes for the 107,000 children waiting in foster care to be adopted. We are driven by Dave's vision: Do what is best for the child. In our unwavering pursuit of this goal, we award grants to adoption organizations that connect children with families, raise funds to support our awareness campaigns and service initiatives, and offer free resources to organizations and prospective parents. Because we depend on people like you to help us fulfill our mission, please visit davethomasfoundation.org, or call 1-800-ASK-DTFA to find out how you can help.
