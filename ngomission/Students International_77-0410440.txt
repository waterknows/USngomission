Established in 1993, Students International (SI) is a nondenominational, Christian ministry organization. SI has missionaries serving in five countries throughout the world. The International Service Center, located in Visalia, California, provides leadership, supervision and support service in the areas of funds development, human resources, information technology, finance and administration, ministry and program development, and marketing. SI does long-term, on-going community development in Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Fiji through the full-time staff missionaries serving in those countries. In addition, outreach participants join our missionaries on short-term or semester programs throughout the year.
