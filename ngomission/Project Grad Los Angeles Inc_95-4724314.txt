Project GRAD (Graduation Really Achieves Dreams) Los Angeles is an education program committed to supporting comprehensive, cost-effective, sustainable and systemic change that challenges students and community partners to embrace learning and actively encourage the pursuit of higher education. Our efforts are focused in a school feeder pattern comprised of eight elementary schools, four middle schools and one high school within the Los Angeles Unified School District in the Northeast San Fernando Valley. To make college enrollment and completion more realistic for typically low-aspiring students, Project GRAD also offers college guidance and scholarships.
