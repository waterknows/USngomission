Founded in 1971, Arizona Opera produces fully-staged operas, concerts, and collaborative programs throughout the state of Arizona each season. We are among only a handful of companies in the United States that regularly performs in more than one city. Arizona Opera elevates the transformative power of storytelling through music-- cultivating community and strengthening a state and people as adventurous and diverse as the place they call home.
