We strive to address education access and excellence by establishing a cross-sector collaborative of corporate, government agency, higher education, and non-profit partnerships, that focus on developing high potential youth of diverse backgrounds into high achievers and responsible leaders. LEAD accomplishes this mission by fostering a vibrant community for students to gain the skills, experience and encouragement they need to fulfill their educational and professional aspirations in the fields of business, engineering and computer science.
