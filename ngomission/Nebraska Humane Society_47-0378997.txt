The Nebraska Humane Society acts as a voice for the animals, and through them, enriches the communities we serve. The Nebraska Humane Society was founded in 1875 and is the fifth oldest Humane Society in the United States. We provide education, give sanctuary to animals, encourage adoptions and promote responsible pet ownership. By providing animal control services to much of the metro area we also serve the citizens of our community by upholding laws enacted for the protection of people and animals. The Nebraska Humane Society is committed to offering refuge and safe haven to unwanted animals.
