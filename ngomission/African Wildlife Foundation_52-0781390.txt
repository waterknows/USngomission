Founded in 1961, the African Wildlife Foundation (AWF), together with the people of Africa, works to ensure the wildlife and wild lands of Africa will endure forever. AWF is the leading international conservation organization focused solely on Africa. We believe that protecting Africa's wildlife and wild landscapes is the key to the future prosperity of Africa and its people - and for over 45 years we have made it our work to help ensure that Africa's wild resources endure. At AWF we approach all of our work at the landscape level - that is to say, we look at large landscapes (we have identified eight of these areas to date). Within these landscapes, we implement a variety of efforts that conserve land, protect species and empower people.
