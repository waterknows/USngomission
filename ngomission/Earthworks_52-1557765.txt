Earthworks is dedicated to protecting communities and the environment from the adverse impacts of mineral and energy development while promoting sustainable solutions. We stand for clean water, healthy communities and corporate accountability. We fulfill our mission by working with communities and grassroots groups to reform government policies, improve corporate practices, influence investment decisions and encourage responsible materials sourcing and consumption. We expose the health, environmental, economic, social and cultural impacts of irresponsible mineral development through work informed by sound science. Earthworks brings together activists, organizers, scientists, engineers, and community leaders in a unified effort to protect our communities and the earth's resources.
