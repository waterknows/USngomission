The Erie Community Foundation (ECF) is a collection of charitable endowments operating under the administrative umbrella of a single public charity. ECF traces its history back to 1935 when Elisha H. Mack, co-founder of the Boston Store, created a charitable endowment fund. Today, we are constantly expanding our collection of nearly 500 different endowment funds, all created locally. ECF works to improve the quality of life in our region by evaluating and addressing community issues, by promoting responsible philanthropy and by connecting donors to the critical needs of the community.
