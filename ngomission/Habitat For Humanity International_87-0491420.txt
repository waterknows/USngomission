Seeking to put God's love into action, Habitat for Humanity of Utah County brings people together to build homes, communities and hope. Through volunteer labor, professional expertise and tax-deductible donations, we obtain land and build simple, decent homes in Utah County. Families who meet our qualifications help build, then purchase the home at no profit to our organization. Their monthly payments go into a revolving fund to help build more homes. Families must have need, be able to pay, and be willing to partner with our organization. New homeowners have a unique pride in this home, which has given them a "hand up", not a "hand-out." Families and communities thrive when everyone has a sturdy, safe, nurturing place to call home
