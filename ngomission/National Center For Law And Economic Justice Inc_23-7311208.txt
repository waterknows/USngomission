The National Center for Law and Economic Justice (NCLEJ) was founded in 1965, in the heyday of the civil rights movement. From the very start, the Center joined with southern civil rights lawyers in landmark cases, worked with community-based organizations around the country, won ground breaking victories in the courts and committed resources to bring about legislative reform. The mission of the National Center for Law and Economic Justice is to advance the cause of economic justice for low-income families, individuals, and communities across the country. Specifically we work to: secure major reforms in the administration of a broad array of programs that promote economic security; eliminate unlawful patterns and practices that deny aid to eligible persons; promote policies that address barriers to employment, and much more.
