Hesed House is the second largest shelter in the State of Illinois, and the largest shelter outside of the city of Chicago. With the help of professional staff, alliances with outside agencies and 6,000 volunteers from 70 area churches, almost one thousand individuals (including 188 children) are served each year through Hesed House's shelter and three housing programs. Hesed House sees 16 newly homeless individuals each week â€“ that's one new homeless individual every 10 1/2 hours. Hesed House strives to get 16 or 17 individuals out of homelessness each week.
