San Gabriel Valley Habitat for Humanity is a local affiliate of Habitat for Humanity (HFH) International. Founded in 1990, we seek to make decent shelter a matter of conscience and action while eliminating poverty housing and homelessness from the San Gabriel Valley. HFH works in partnership with God and people from all walks of life to create better, permanent shelter for lower-income families. To accomplish this, HFH builds and renovates houses, providing decent homes in decent communities where people can live and grow into all that God intended. Our affiliate has built 39 homes and has 11 more currently under construction on Kenwood Street in Glendale. When these homes are complete, our affiliate will attain the important 50-home productivity benchmark and will be providing 205 men, women and children with safe, decent, affordable shelter.
