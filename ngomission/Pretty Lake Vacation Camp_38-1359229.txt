Since 1916, Pretty Lake Camp has provided a cost-free summer camp experience to over 50,000 at-risk youth from Kalamazoo County. Throughout the years, we have enriched the lives of thousands of youth by offering a safe, structured and encouraging environment in a natural setting. We accommodate over 700 children each summer. Many of the children who attend Pretty Lake Camp face significant challenges at home, in school, and in their community. We strive to remove all barriers that prevent a child from being able to come to camp.
