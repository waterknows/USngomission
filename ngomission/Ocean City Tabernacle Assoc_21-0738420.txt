Dating back to Ocean City's earliest beginnings, the mission of the Ocean City Tabernacle has been to spread the Gospel of Jesus Christ. We strive to serve, support, inspire, strengthen and connect members of the community. As the needs of area residents and visitors have grown, the Tabernacle has grown to meet them with meaningful family-focused programs and uplifting, non-denominational worship services where everyone is made to feel welcome.
