The mission of Hope Rural School is to offer hope to families. The school primarily serves children from immigrant families by providing them with a Catholic Elementary education in grades Pre-K through 5 in an environment that nurtures the Gospel values of mercy, justice, and love. We do this through fostering the principles of Christian discipleship; supporting, guiding and encouraging parents in the education of their children; developing an appreciation and respect for heritage; and encouraging and enabling graduates to reach their full potential through advanced education.
