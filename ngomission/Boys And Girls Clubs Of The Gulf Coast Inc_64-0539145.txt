Boys & Girls Clubs of the Gulf Coast's mission is to enable all young people, especially those who need us most, to reach their full potential as productive, caring, responsible citizens. Our corporation formed to promote the health, social, educational, vocational, and character development of all boys and girls throughout the gulf coast area. BGCGC is now offering the Healthy Choices, Brighter Future Program designed to educate our youth on at risk behaviors and to create an environment within the family and community to support youth decisions to postpone sexual activities until marriage.
