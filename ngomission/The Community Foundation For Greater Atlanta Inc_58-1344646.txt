Since 1951 The Community Foundation for Greater Atlanta has been connecting community members, nonprofits and other partners to strengthen the Atlanta region through philanthropy. There are more than 700 community foundations across the country each with one goal - to create a vital, philanthropic community within their geographic area. The Community Foundation for Greater Atlanta does that right here in Atlanta within our 23-county region. As a community foundation, we focus on four key goals: engaging our community; strengthening our region's non-profits; advancing public will; and practicing organizational excellence.
