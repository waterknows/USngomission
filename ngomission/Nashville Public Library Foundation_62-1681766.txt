Nashville Public Library Foundation (NPLF) raises private funds to enhance the programs, facilities and collections of the Nashville Public Library. Private support through the Foundation funds exceptional programming and extraordinary spaces. For example, the Limitless Libraries partnership redefines the role of the public library by giving students in all Metro Nashville Public Schools access to more than 2 million books and other materials delivered right to their school library.
