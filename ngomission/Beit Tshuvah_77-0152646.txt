Beit T'Shuvah is an outgrowth of the Jewish Committee for Personal Service, an organization started in 1921 by a small group of Rabbis and Social Workers. Today, Beit T'Shuvah is both a residential treatment center and a full-service congregation offering religious services, holiday celebrations and study. Additionally, the treatment center offers outreach to the entire community including prevention programs, family and alumni counseling and support, court advocacy and professional training. Beit T'Shuvah has a vision to reduce the incidence of addition and other harmful behaviors through individual and family education that is offered through dynamic programs designed to meet the individual needs of each resident in every stage of recovery.
