Founded in 1939, the Center for Early Education (CEE) is an independent, coed day school committed to providing an exemplary education for preschool and elementary students of differing ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds. The Center makes every effort to be supportive, inclusive, and respectful of our diverse student body, while remaining sensitive to each student's social, emotional and academic needs. Our challenging programs are designed to encourage students to become lifelong learners and to instill in them a joy of learning, resilience, self-esteem, respect for others, and commitment to the community beyond the school. Throughout its history, CEE has focused on all dimensions of a child's development: intellectual, social, emotional, physical and ethical.
