High Plains Public Radio (HPPR) was founded in 1977 for the expressed purpose of enriching the educational, cultural, and community life of the High Plains region. It is also dedicated to developing the self-identity of the High Plains so that the region might better appreciate its common heritage and build a sustainable future. It pursues this mission through public radio broadcasting because the medium is economical and accessible to nearly everyone. HPPR is an affiliate of National Public Radio serving western Kansas, eastern Colorado, and the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles.
