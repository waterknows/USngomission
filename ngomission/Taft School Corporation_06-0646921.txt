Founded in 1890, The Taft School is a coeducational boarding school for 577 students in grades nine through post graduate. The Taft School's fundamental values include: work hard, without regard for public acclaim; develop all your talents: academic, artistic, and athletic; and most importantly, give of yourself to others. Living where they learn, academically talented students from all over the world are guided by an extraordinary faculty on a 220-acre campus in Western Connecticut. Today, Taft's 114 faculty members educate boys and girls from 35 states and 28 countries.
