Established in 1987, Marion-Polk Food Share (MPFS) is a non-profit charity providing food for people at risk of hunger in Oregon's mid-Willamette Valley. Between July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2012, MPFS distributed 8.2 million pounds - just to assist hungry residents of Marion and Polk counties. With that food, our network of over 98 member direct-service charities gave out more than 108,000 emergency food boxes and prepared and served more than 710,000 on-site meals. These partner agencies include food pantries, meal sites, shelters, low income day care centers and senior housing sites.
