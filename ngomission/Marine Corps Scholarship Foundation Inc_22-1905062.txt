Established in 1962, the Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation (MCSF) provides financial assistance in the form of scholarships for higher education to deserving sons and daughters of Marines and children of former Marines, with particular attention being given to children whose parent was killed or wounded in action. We are proud of our long history and commitment: Since 1962, we have awarded more than 27,000 scholarships and bonds totaling more than $66 million, including just under $5 million to 1,636 scholarship recipients in 2011.
