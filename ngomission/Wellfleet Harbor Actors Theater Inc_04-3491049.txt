Founded in 1999, The Mission of Wellfleet Harbor Actors Theater (WHAT) is to present professional quality theater to its audiences; to provide an alternative theater experience not found elsewhere in the region; to advance and preserve the art of the theater for the education and appreciation of the public. We host films and panel discussions in partnership with Mass Audubon Wellfleet Bay Wildlife Sanctuary, WCAI, SPAT, CCI, Journey Forward and others.
