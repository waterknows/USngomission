In 1940, The Albert Schweitzer Fellowship (ASF) was founded in the United States to support Dr. Schweitzer's medical work in Africa during World War II. Today, the mission of ASF is to reduce disparities in health and healthcare by developing leaders in service. These leaders are individuals who are dedicated and skilled in helping underserved communities, and whose example influences and inspires others. ASF achieves this through an interdisciplinary, service-learning model that fosters moral and professional development. This model combines mentored, entrepreneurial, community-based service projects; a curriculum that emphasizes values and leadership; structured opportunities for individual and group reflection; and lifelong fellowship with service-oriented colleagues.
