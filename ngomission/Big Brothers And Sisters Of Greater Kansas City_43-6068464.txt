Founded in 1964, Big Brothers Big Sisters of Greater Kansas City (BBBSKC) works to create and support life-changing friendships for children. BBSKC provides children facing adversity with strong, enduring and professionally supported one-to-one relationships that change their lives for the better, forever. BBBSKC matches school-aged youth (Littles) from one-parent or other non-traditional homes, with caring, adult volunteers (Bigs).
