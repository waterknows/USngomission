As the strategic nonprofit partner of the Minneapolis Public Schools (MPS), AchieveMpls mobilizes a wide web of community support to ensure academic achievement, equitable opportunities and career and college readiness for all students. We believe that preparing our young people to succeed in school, work and life is the best investment we can make in our city's health and vitality.In 2002, Twin Cities education, business, government and civic leaders were inspired by the need to join forces in supporting public education and preparing students for successful life after high school. They came together to form a strong and vibrant nonprofit organization: AchieveMpls. AchieveMpls serves as a bridge between MPS and our broader community - businesses, foundations, nonprofits, government agencies and individuals - providing information and opportunities to engage as volunteers, employers, funders, advocates and advisers.
