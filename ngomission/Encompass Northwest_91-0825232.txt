Encompass is an independent, non-profit, children's and family-services organization established in 1966 with a unique mission: to nurture children, enrich families and inspire community. Our programs nurture typical and developmentally challenged children, enrich families in all their diversity and inspire community throughout the Snoqualmie Valley, Issaquah, Sammamish and the greater Eastside.
