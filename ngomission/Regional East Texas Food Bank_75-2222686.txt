Since 1988, The East Texas Food Bank has been fighting hunger and feeding hope to those in need. They provide food to over 200 partner agencies, in an effort to feed children, the working poor and senior citizens throughout 26 counties in East Texas. As a clearinghouse for donated food, the East Texas Food Bank forms a partnership with the food industry by collecting, inspecting, sorting, packaging and distributing food to member agencies, which provide food directly to those in need. The East Texas Food Bank is a member of Feeding America, The Nation's Food Bank Network.
