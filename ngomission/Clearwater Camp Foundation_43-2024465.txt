The mission of the Clearwater Camp Foundation is to preserve and perpetuate the traditions and spirit of Clearwater Camp for Girls for present and future generations of young women. The Clearwater Camp Foundation was incorporated in 2003 to help ensure that Clearwater Camp for Girls will continue to operate in the spirit that has guided it since its founding in 1933. In collaboration with the camp directors and staff, the Foundation board acts to protect the camp's natural environment, manage the camp's facilities and support the camp's programming - with the over-arching goal being to develop the whole self in every camper.
