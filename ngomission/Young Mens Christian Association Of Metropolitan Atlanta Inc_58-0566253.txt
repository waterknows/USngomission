First opened in 1858, the YMCA of Metropolitan Atlanta, reflecting its Judeo-Christian heritage, is an association of volunteers, members and staff open to and serving all, providing programs and services which develop spirit, mind, and body. The YMCA actively seeks to identify and involve those in need. We build strong kids, strong families, strong communities by enriching the lives of all people in spirit, mind, and body. All YMCA programs are anchored in ideals such as core character values and leadership development, providing programs that serve the needs of the community and enrich individuals.
