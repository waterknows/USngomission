The primary purpose of the Texas Lions Camp (TLC) is to provide a camp for physically disabled, hearing/vision impaired, and diabetic children from the State of Texas, regardless of race, religion, or national origin. Our goal is to provide an atmosphere wherein campers will learn the Can Do philosophy and be allowed to achieve maximum personal growth and self-esteem. The Texas Lions Camp was chartered in 1949 in response to the terrible polio epidemic that forever changed the lives of so many Texas children. Since that time, TLC has dynamically changed to include children who have all manner and types of physical disabilities, diabetes and cancer. Today, we are serving more children than at any other time in our history. Over 1,500 children per summer attend TLC.
