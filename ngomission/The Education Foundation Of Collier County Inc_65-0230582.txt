The Education Foundation of Collier County, founded in 1990, is an independent organization whose purpose is to enhance learning for Collier County children and their teachers by engaging community support. Having begun with just a single program, The Education Foundation's initiatives have evolved to support recruitment, retention, and recognition of excellent teachers and principals, and programs designed for individual student success- all within a larger community-wide framework to support education.
