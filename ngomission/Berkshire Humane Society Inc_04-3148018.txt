Founded in 1992, the Berkshire Humane Society (BHS) is an open-admission animal support organization with a twofold mission: to ensure the compassionate care, treatment, and whenever possible, placement of homeless animals through the shelter operation; and to promote and improve the welfare of all animals through community education and outreach. In addition to our primary mission of sheltering animals, the BHS conducts many vital programs that benefit the people of our community, including, free educational programs for local school children, a pet-food bank for economically distressed pet owners, and assistance for The Elizabeth Freeman Center in providing abused women with a safe haven for their pets during crisis.
