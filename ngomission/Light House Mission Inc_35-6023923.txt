The Light House Mission was established in 1890 to minister the love of Jesus Christ to the Least, the Last, and the Lost of our Community through the provision of assistance in the areas of guidance, counseling, education, job training, shelter, food, clothing, health care and independent living communities. The Mission has expanded its range and geographic scope of services to include 19 counties in Western Indiana and Eastern Illinois. We have a working relationship with the law enforcement agencies, welfare departments, government agencies, state prison system, and many churches in these counties who refer people in need to us.
