Seeking to put God's love into action Habitat for Humanity Lake County brings people together to build homes, communities and hope.We build, rehab and repair homes with families in need, while empowering families to help themselves. Through our partnerships we make safe, simple, decent housing for all people a matter of conscience and action. Since 1989 HFHLC has served over 200 low-income families through homeownership. Homeowner families are selected according to their need, their ability to repay our no-profit, no-interest mortgage, and their partnership to contribute 500 hours of sweat equity. Partner Families complete at least 25 classes in financial literacy along with monthly 1:1 budget counseling.The Habitat ReStore accepts and then sells new and used building materials and household goods further supporting affordable housing, while keeping tons of material from the landfill. It is at 3545 Grand Avenue in Gurnee.
