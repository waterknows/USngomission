Founded in 1975, the Permian Basin Petroleum Museum tells the story of petroleum and the rugged lives of men and women who sought a better life. What started as a community dream has, over time, become the nation's largest museum dedicated to the petroleum industry and its pioneers. It shares the petroleum and energy story and its impact on our daily lives through educational programs, interactive exhibits, an archives center and its Petroleum Hall of Fame. The mission of the Permian Basin Petroleum Museum is to share the petroleum and energy story and its impact on our lives.
