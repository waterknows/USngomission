The Texas Public Policy Foundation is a non-partisan research institute guided by the core principles of individual liberty, personal responsibility, private property rights, free markets and limited government. The Foundation's mission is to improve Texas by generating academically sound research and data on state issues, and by recommending the findings to opinion leaders, policymakers, the media and general public. The public is demanding a different direction for their government, and the Texas Public Policy Foundation is providing the ideas that enable policymakers to chart that new course.
