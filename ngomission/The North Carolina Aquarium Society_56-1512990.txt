The North Carolina Aquarium Society is the support organization for the three North Carolina Aquariums. Established in 1986, it is dedicated to assisting these facilities in maintaining their high standards of exhibits, education and conservation programs. The North Carolina Aquariums continue to expand and improve. In 1976, the Aquariums had a little more than two hundred thousand visitors. Today, the three Aquariums educate over one million annual visitors. The Aquariums have completed expansion of all three facilities, Pine Knoll Shores, Roanoke Island and Fort Fisher, doubling the size of each. In 2011, the Aquariums opened their newest site, the restored Jennette's Pier at Nags Head.
