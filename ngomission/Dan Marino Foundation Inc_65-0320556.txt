The Dan Marino Foundation was established in 1992 by Dan and Claire Marino, motivated by their experiences in raising their son, Michael, who is diagnosed with autism. The Foundation's mission is "empowering individuals with autism and other developmental disabilities through therapies, research, education, and employment in pursuit of a greater quality of life." For over 20 years, the Foundation has served individuals with disabilities in South Florida and raised more than $45 million to create unique and impactful initiatives in the community. Among these "first-of-their-kind" initiatives were the Miami Children's Hospital Dan Marino Center, Childnett.tv, the Marino Autism Research Institute, Marino Adapted Aquatics, Summer STEPS Employment Programs, and now, opening in 2014, Marino Campus.
