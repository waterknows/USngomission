Bangor Humane Society (BHS) was founded in 1869 making us the oldest Humane Society in the State of Maine. We operate Maine's largest animal care and adoption facility, both in terms of the total number of animals handled and geographical area we serve. The BHS cares for approximately 5,000 owner released and stray animals each year. We serve over 200 communities in Maine, including eastern, coastal, down-east, and parts of northern Maine.
