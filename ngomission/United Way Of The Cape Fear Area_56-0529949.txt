United Way of the Cape Fear Area has been impacting our local community since 1941. Throughout the years, methods may have changed but the outcome is the same: United Way is working alongside local agencies in order to assist them in providing substantial and sustainable change within the Cape Fear Area. The United Way staff and board are dedicated to achieving targeted results in the areas of pressing need within our community. Utilizing the resources of community members, agencies, businesses, and civic organizations, United Way is unifying the community to invest in solutions and working to achieve measurable results.
