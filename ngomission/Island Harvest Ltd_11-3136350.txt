Island Harvest works to end hunger and reduce food waste on Long Island. Since 1992, Island Harvest has been serving as the bridge between those who have surplus food and those who need it. Our volunteers and staff rescue or collect surplus food from over 800 local restaurants, caterers, farmers, and other food businesses. We then distribute it to a network of more than 570 soup kitchens, food pantries, and other places where those in need can access it. We also conduct educational programs to increase hunger awareness and inform the public how they can get involved in our mission to end hunger and reduce food waste on Long Island.
