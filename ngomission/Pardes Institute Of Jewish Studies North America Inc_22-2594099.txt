The American Pardes Foundation provides financial support to the students and faculty members of the Pardes Institute of Jewish Studies in Israel. Founded in 1972, Pardes has a 30-year-long track record of producing caring Jewish laypeople and professionals with deep Jewish knowledge, a passion for Jewish living and openness to all Jews - the kind of Jews who every day become the cornerstones of enduring Jewish community wherever they go. The work of Pardes graduates demonstrates how potent the Pardes recipe is for reinvigorating Jewish life from the ground up. 500 overseas and local residents participate in Pardes learning programs in Jerusalem each year, including over 100 university graduates from the US, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Latvia, Poland, Ukraine and the UK.
