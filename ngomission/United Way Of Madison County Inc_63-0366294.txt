United Way of Madison County is to be a leader in the community, uniting volunteers and resources to solve community problems and address health and human services needs through the programs of our partner agencies. Since 1943, United Way of Madison County has allocated more than $77 million to United Way partner agencies and programs in our community. The United Way targets its community impact on three focus areas: education, which is essential to getting and keeping a job with a livable wage and health benefits; income, to provide financial stability for today's necessities as well as the future; and health, to keep children on track at school, adults productive at work, and the elderly independent in their own homes.
