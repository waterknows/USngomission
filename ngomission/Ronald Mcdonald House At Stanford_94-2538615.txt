Ronald McDonald House at Stanford creates a home-away-from-home and supportive community for families of children with life-threatening illnesses receiving specialized treatment at local hospitals. Built in 1979, Ronald McDonald House at Stanford was the fifth such House in the country. Since then, the House has grown from 13 to 47 bedrooms, 12 full time employees, and more than 100 volunteers. The House now offers families so much more than its founders could have hoped for, it's more than a room with a shower and a bed. The program offerings at the House have grown exponentially and make a huge impact in creating the community environment that supports these families.
