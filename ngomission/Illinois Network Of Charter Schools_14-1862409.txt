The Illinois Network of Charter Schools (INCS) brings together students, parents, educators and administrators who all share a common goal: to improve the quality of public education by promoting and strengthening charter schools throughout the State of Illinois. At INCS, we believe strong charter schools help create a better public school system for everyone. Some of the benefits charter schools deliver include: Student Outcomes; Parent and Community Empowerment; and Innovation.
