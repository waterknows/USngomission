Since its beginnings in the 1890s as the Denver Artists' Club, the Denver Art Museum has had a number of temporary homes. The museum opened its own galleries in 1949, and a center for children's art activities was added in the early 1950s. In 1971, we opened what's now known as the North Building. Our most recent expansion opened in October 2006. Today, the 356,000-square-foot museum complex includes collection gallery space, three temporary exhibition venues, and the Lewis I. Sharp Auditorium. In addition to our art collections, the Denver Art Museum is internationally recognized for our family-friendly environment, and has received critical acclaim for encouraging art appreciation through interactive activities.
