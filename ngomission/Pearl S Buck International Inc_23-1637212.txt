Established in 1964, Pearl S. Buck International (PSBI) has three distinct functions that operate as one with the common mission of continuing the legacy and dreams of Pearl S. Buck - her commitment to improving the quality of life and expanding opportunities for children and promoting an understanding of the values and attributes of other cultures, the injustice of prejudice, and the need for humanitarianism throughout the world. Our programs include the Pearl S. Buck House & Historic Site, which preserves and interprets Pearl S. Bucks' National Historic Landmark Home, the Welcome House, which provides children throughout the world the opportunity to grow in a loving permanent family, and Opportunity House, which develops and delivers resources and standards of excellence to affiliates and partner agencies throughout the world.
