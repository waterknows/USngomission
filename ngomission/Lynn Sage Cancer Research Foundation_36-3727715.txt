The Lynn Sage Cancer Research Foundation (LSCRF) is one of the nation's leading breast cancer research and education charities. It was founded in 1985 in memory of Lynn Sage, a Chicago-area woman who endured a six-year struggle with breast cancer with her spirit and dignity intact before she died at the age of 39. Our mission is to support the understanding, research and treatment of breast cancer in partnership with Chicago's Northwestern Memorial Hospital and the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University. Since its inception, LSCRF has raised over $27 million for breast cancer research. LSCRF fulfills its mission by funding a breast cancer research program, a breast fellowship program, and breast cancer outreach.
