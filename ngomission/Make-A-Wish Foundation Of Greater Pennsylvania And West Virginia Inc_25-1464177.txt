The Make-A-Wish Foundation of Greater Pennsylvania & West Virginia grants the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions to enrich the human experience of hope, strength, and joy. Make-A-Wish Greater Pennsylvania & West Virginia was founded in May 1983 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. We are the first chapter in the world to fulfill more than 700 wishes in one year. We have served more than 16,000 children in 57 Pennsylvania and the entire state of West Virginia counties in our 31-year history.
