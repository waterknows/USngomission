Charles River Watershed Association (CRWA) was formed in 1965 in response to public concern about the declining condition of the Charles. CRWA's mission is to use science, advocacy and the law to protect, preserve and enhance the Charles River and its watershed. At CRWA, we strive to: develop a sound, science-based understanding of interactions in the watershed; define long-term, cutting-edge solutions to watershed problems; promote sustainable watershed management practices with government agencies and private entities; and advocate for the protection, revitalization, and expansion of public parklands along the Charles.
