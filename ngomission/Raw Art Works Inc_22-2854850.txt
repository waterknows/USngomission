Raw Art Works (RAW) creates a culture where every artist feels welcomed, connected, and committed to our community. RAW is there for kids when they struggle with a piece of art or a piece of their lives. RAW's clinical art therapists and professional artists build meaningful relationships with each kid, helping them see a broader palette of life choices. They challenge them to change negative patterns while giving unrelenting support to reach what may seem unattainable. Recognizing the positive impact that RAW has on the lives of the kids we serve, RAW's programs have evolved beyond the making of art and film. We have created platforms for success by providing mentoring for college access and SAT prep, financial aid access, youth employment, and opportunities to develop life skills like public speaking and personal financial responsibility. RAW serves as a place that increases access to possibilities for the young artists that walk through our doors.
