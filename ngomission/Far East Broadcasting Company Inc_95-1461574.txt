Founded in 1945, Far East Broadcasting Company (FEBC) is a non-denominational, international Christian radio network that broadcasts the Good News in more than 150 languages from 32 transmitters located throughout the world. FEBC's mission is to develop radio programming and deliver it to listeners in Asia in such a way that they move toward Jesus Christ and into His Kingdom, that they know Him as Saviour, Lord, and King, follow His teaching, and live in obedience to Him as His servants, and as members of a local body of believers. FEBC overcomes the barriers of poverty, geography, and persecution to share Christ's love through radio and internet broadcasts.
