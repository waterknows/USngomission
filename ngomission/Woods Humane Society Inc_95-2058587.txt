Woods Humane Society's mission is to serve, protect and shelter homeless companion animals. Our primary focus is as an adoption shelter where the public can find new companion animals to adopt and where animals can be placed when their owners are no longer able to care for them. One of the best kept secrets about Woods is the Woods-Cashin Surgery Center. Over the past 12 months the Woods Medical Team has performed nearly 4,000 spay and neuter surgeries and provided spay and neuter services for a dozen local nonprofit rescue groups.
