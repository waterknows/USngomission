Founded in 1970, the Mid-Iowa Council Boy Scouts of America provides a program for boys and young adults to build character, to train in the responsibilities of participating citizenship, and to develop physical and mental fitness. Scouting stresses character, leadership, community service, and environmental stewardship. It also instills a sense of achievement for youth of all races and economic backgrounds.
