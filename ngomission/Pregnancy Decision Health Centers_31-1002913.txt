Pregnancy Decision Health Centers (PDHC) began in 1978 as a dream of a few couples who wanted to help expectant women receive compassionate care in central Ohio. Since then, so many others have made this dream their own. Today, volunteers number in the hundreds, and PDHC serves more than 21,000 women annually through the hotline, chat, email and in person at five Care Centers. PDHC has provided free ultrasounds for clients since 1995. The powerful truth of the ultrasound picture is that it has resulted in many abortion-vulnerable clients choosing life for their babies. Since our inception, more than 3,000 abortion-vulnerable women have chosen life for their children, and at least another 3,000 who were struggling with an abortion decision decided to consider other options after visiting PDHC.
