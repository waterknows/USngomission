The Foundation to Eradicate Duchenne (FED) was established in 2002 with the goal of finding treatments and an ultimate cure for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), the world's leading lethal childhood genetic disease. The FED raises money to support the world's only clinical trials network for DMD. The clinical trials network known as CINRG works with scientists all over the world on therapies for DMD - a fatal disease which scientists now say is tantalizingly close to being cured. In pursuit of the cure, FED has raised millions of dollars for the best DMD scientists and doctors around the world. DMD is an x-linked hereditary disease characterized by the absence of a protein known as dystrophin which causes degeneration and necrosis of skeletal muscle fibers.
