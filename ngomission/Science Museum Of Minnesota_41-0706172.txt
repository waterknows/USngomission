The Science Museum of Minnesota (SMM), founded in 1907, is a large regional science museum located on the banks of the Mississippi River in downtown St. Paul. SMM's programs combine research and collection facilities, a public science education center, extensive teacher education and school outreach programs, and an Imax Convertible Dome Omnitheater to provide science education to our audience of more than a million people per year. The Museum's mission is to turn on the science by realizing the potential of policy makers, educators, and individuals to achieve full civic and economic participation in the world.
