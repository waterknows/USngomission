 As one of the nation's leading non-profit performing arts institutions and guardian of the historic Wang and Shubert theatres, Citi Performing Arts Center honors all aspects of the performing arts offering theatre, opera, classical and popular music, one-night engagements, and Broadway musicals. Located in Boston's historical Theater District, it offers a diverse mix of educational workshops and community activities through its education department; collaborates with artists and local performing arts organizations, and acts as a champion for the arts in New England to insure that the arts are an integral part of the community's collective, daily experience.
