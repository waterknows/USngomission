The Pope Memorial SPCA is dedicated to caring for abandoned and homeless pets, protecting and advocating for pets in need, and promoting the humane treatment of all animals. The Pope Memorial SPCA envisions our community to be a safe haven for animals, where the animal-human bond is nurtured and all animals are treated with compassion and respect. The shelter strives to place homeless animals in loving homes that are committed to their lifetime care. This goal is facilitated by medically and behaviorally evaluating all animals, providing necessary veterinary care and working closely with applicants to ensure a successful match.
