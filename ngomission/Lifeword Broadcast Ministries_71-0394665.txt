Founded in 1965, Lifeword Media Ministries is dedicated to communicating the gospel of Jesus Christ through mass media to every living soul upon the earth. We are focusing on the unreached; making the presentations culturally relevant; speaking in the heart-language of the hearer; using creative approaches to capture the listener's attention; responding to felt needs of our neighbors, whether near or far; ministering to local churches through media services; striving always to present ourselves in a professional and Godly manner; and working in harmony with our fellow Christians and living exemplary lives which reflect the God-given joy of being ambassadors for Christ.
