Police Protective Fund (PPF) is a public awareness organization dedicated to enhancing public safety through education. PPF was established in 1998 by the leadership of the American Association of Police Officers, to enhance the public's understanding of law enforcer safety issues. Guided by police officers and distinguished citizens, the organization is dedicated to strengthening the safety net over which a law enforcement officer must perform their profession's perilous duties. Proceed With Caution is the centerpiece of PPF's public awareness efforts. The program addresses an issue of grave concern to public safety officials. To date, the program has reached millions of Americans with an urgent appeal to the nation's drivers that is vital to the safety of law enforcers: Proceed With Caution - Police at Work.
