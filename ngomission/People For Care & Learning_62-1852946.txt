People for Care and Learning (PCL) was founded in 2002 as a humanitarian organization created to provide care and learning opportunities around the world. They are dedicated to serving the poor by helping children, widows and their communities worldwide reach their full potential by giving the poor a working chance. PCL seeks to serve the poor by providing opportunities for impoverished people to transform their lives through schools, feeding centers, orphan and widow care, vocational training, leadership development, basic business education and micro-enterprise opportunities. For over a decade, PCL has been moving into neighborhoods throughout Southeast Asia and the United States inspiring hope, extending justice and giving the poor a working chance.
