Heroes for Children advocates for and provides financial and social assistance to families with children (0-22 yrs of age) battling cancer. Since 2004, Heroes for Children has helped alleviate families' worries, giving them comfort and a brief respite from the everyday challenges of cancer-fighting and caregiving. Our vision is that no family with a child battling cancer will fight alone.
