When you are far from home, your child is in the hospital, and you have not had anything to eat the entire day, except for a vending machine, the last thought you should worry about is where am I going to stay tonight. Ronald McDonald House of Southern New Jersey (SNJ) strives to support these families with a safe haven from the hospital halls. Ronald McDonald House of SNJ opened on 6th Street in Camden in 1983. Ronald McDonald House of Southern New Jersey has served as a "home-away-from-home," for over 17,000 families whose children are being treated at nearby hospitals for critical illness or traumatic injuries. We enable over 800 families a year to focus on helping their children heal.
