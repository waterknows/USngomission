Rather than duplicating the traditional shelter philosophy of accepting every surrendered animal only to become overcrowded and forced to euthanize, the Northwest Organization for Animal Help (N.O.A.H.) is taking a new approach. We assist animals in the most desperate need of help, the animals that have run out of time at other shelters and are facing death. By working cooperatively with area animal shelters and only accepting pets directly from their facilities, we give animals on death-row another chance at life. Opened in 1988, the N.O.A.H. Center features a customer-friendly and guilt-free adoption environment; a state-of-the-art veterinary clinic and spay/neuter surgical suite; interactive classes and pet training; professional grooming; and wilderness trails.
