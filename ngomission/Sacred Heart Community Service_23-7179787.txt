Sacred Heart Community Service, founded in 1964, works to change lives and impact poverty by providing essential services, offering tools for self-sufficiency, and ministering with dignity, compassion and respect. We engage the community and inspire volunteers to love, serve and share. Over 1,500 customers walk through our doors daily to access a wide range of services. Our programs, from basic needs to education, are offered comprehensively under one roof and are free of charge to the customers. We also provide helpful information and referral to our customers in collaboration with other human service agencies in the community.
