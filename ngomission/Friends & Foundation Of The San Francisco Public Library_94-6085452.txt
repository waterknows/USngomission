Formally established in 1999 and originally called Friends and Foundation, Friends of the San Francisco Public Library is the union of the Friends of the San Francisco Public Library and the Library Foundation of San Francisco. Friends of the San Francisco Public Library advocates, fundraises, and provides critical support for the San Francisco Public Library and related literary and educational programs. Our mission is to create, steward, and support a superior, free public library system in San Francisco. We are committed to raising the standard of excellence of our libraries by funding programs and services beyond what is allocated in the City's budget. We believe in free and equal access to information for all.
