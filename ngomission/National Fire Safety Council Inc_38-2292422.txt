The National Fire Safety Council (NFSC) research team of creative educators develop fire safety materials for adults and children of all age levels. These include comprehensive 24-page graded manuals with a teacher's guide, assorted folders, brochures, posters, wall charts, decals, stickers, and other types of materials as requested, with new materials being developed daily. The various topics covered by NFSC materials include: smoke alarms; home fire exit drills; arson; babysitting; heating safety; Stop, Drop, and Roll; friendly firefighters; holiday hazards; seat belt safety; bicycle safety; water safety; burn prevention; and more. NFSC works with fire departments throughout the United States. The Council's fire safety educational programs of materials and services are provided to communities exclusively through local fire departments.
