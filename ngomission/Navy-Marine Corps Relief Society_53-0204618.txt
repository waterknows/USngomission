Founded in 1904, the Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society operates nearly 250 offices ashore and afloat at Navy and Marine Corps bases throughout the world. The Society provides, financial, educational, and other assistance to active duty and retired members of the U. S. Navy and Marine Corps, their eligible family members, and survivors to achieve financial self-sufficiency and find solutions to emergency needs. In 2014, the Society provided $48.5 million need-based interest-free loans and grants to nearly 62,000 Sailors, Marines and their families around the world. This assistance directly impacted the mission-readiness of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps and the quality of life of those who are serving our country in uniform, or retired from service.
