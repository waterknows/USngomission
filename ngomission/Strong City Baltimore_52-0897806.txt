Established in 1969, Greater Homewood Community Corporation (GHCC) is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to build and strengthen vibrant urban communities in north central Baltimore City. Our work centers on the pillars of vibrant urban living: safe streets, good and diverse quality housing stock, quality schools, and livability. Much like the neighborhoods we serve, our programs are interconnected and bolster our holistic approach to fulfilling our mission.
