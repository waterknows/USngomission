Teachers Without Borders connects teachers to information and each other to create local change on a global scale.

Our programs are conceived, developed, and led by teachers connected by information and each other in order to address demand-driven needs and ensure long-term impact. The evidence is clear: a quality education correlates with dramatic advances in human welfare. Better health. Fewer infant deaths. Cleaner water. Human rights. All children deserve the right to flourish because of great teachers. Teachers Without Borders was created in 2000 to connect teacher professional development and international development.
