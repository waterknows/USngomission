The mission of the Boy Scouts of America is to prepare young people to make ethical choices over their lifetime by instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Law. The Georgia-Carolina Council, Boy Scouts of America was chartered in 1922 by the Rotary Club of Augusta. Since that time, the Council has grown to now serve sixteen counties in the CSRA: Aiken, Barnwell, Burke, Columbia, Edgefield, Emanuel, Glascock, Jefferson, Jenkins, Lincoln, McCormick, McDuffie, Richmond, Taliaferro, Warren, and Wilkes. Currently, we have over 80 chartered partners with 168 scouting units and over 6,200 registered youth members and over 1,500 registered volunteers.
