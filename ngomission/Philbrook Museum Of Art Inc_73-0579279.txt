Founded in 1938, the Philbrook Museum of Art is dedicated to enriching Tulsa's cultural atmosphere by providing our community, state and region with a fine arts outlet in which they may discover, learn and participate with art as part of a multi-sensory experience. The vision first made possible by Waite and Genevieve Phillips is now one of America's finest art museums. The integrity of the original residence remains intact while later additions to the facility and gardens complete this classic Tulsa attraction. From breathtaking gardens to captivating architecture and fine dining, the Philbrook offers an array of opportunities. Our many classes and public programs offer a unique opportunity to develop a better understanding and appreciation of art for patrons of all ages.
