The mission of Christian World Outreach is to participate with the body of Christ in responsible evangelism, to bring dignity, self worth and encouragement through leadership development, and to meet the physical needs of people through humanitarian assistance. CWO was founded in 1979 and has grown to an organization that provides medical clinics, vocational training, leadership development, children's feeding programs, HIV/AIDS prevention education, AIDS orphan assistance, youth camps, educational libraries, discipleship, evangelistic outreach and more. In 2000, CWO expanded its programs to include work in Africa and currently in three African countries including Burkina Faso, Zambia, and Zimbabwe as well as continuing its work in Haiti.
