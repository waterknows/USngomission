The Mission of the Dr. Susan Love Research Foundation is to create a future without breast cancer by focusing on the cause and prevention. We will meet this challenge by being fast, flexible, and project-based. We will identify needs and determine how these needs can be quickly met, not by emulating existing nonprofit organizations but by designing a new model specific to the tasks at hand. We will find the most effective route to breast cancer eradication, whether it is in the not-for-profit arena, the for-profit arena, or both. We will approach problems by collaborating and coordinating with other organizations. We will facilitate solutions to be adopted by others.
