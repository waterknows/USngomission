Founded in 1887, Trail Blazers is an award-winning youth development organization that has touched the lives of thousands of young people from New York and New Jersey. Through outdoor experiential education adventure programming, we strive to facilitate the development of values and life skills essential for productive citizenship. In our core program, the Summer Outdoor Experiential Experience, a 2 or 4 week summer adventure, children participate in an elaborate environmental adventure program that includes activities such as swimming, hiking, biking, canoeing and climbing. The program culminates with an expedition on the Appalachian Trail or the Delaware River
