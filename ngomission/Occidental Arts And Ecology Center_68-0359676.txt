Occidental Arts and Ecology Center (OAEC) is an education center, organic demonstration farm and intentional community located on 80 acres that encompass wildlands of meadows and mixed oak, fir and redwood forests. Much of the Center's work is in response to the challenge of how to create ecologically, economically and culturally sustainable communities that are democratic and serve as a counterpoint to privatized and corporatized society. The Center's bio-intensive organic gardens and orchards have been a source of inspiration and training for thousands of gardeners, farmers and landscapers for over 35 years: first as the Farallones Institute (1974 - 1990); then as the Center for Seven Generations (1990 - 1993); and now as OAEC (1994 - present).
