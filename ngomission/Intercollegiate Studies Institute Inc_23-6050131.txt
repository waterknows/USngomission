The Intercollegiate Studies Institute (ISI) is a non-partisan, educational organization whose purpose is to further in successive generations of college youth a better understanding of the values and institutions that sustain a free and humane society. Founded in 1953, ISI works to educate for liberty - to identify the best and the brightest college students and to nurture in these future leaders the American ideal of ordered liberty. ISI seeks to enhance the rising generation's knowledge of our nation's founding principles - limited government, individual liberty, personal responsibility, the rule of law, market economy, and moral norms. The Institute annually works with hundreds of thousands of students and faculty through its integrated program of lectures, conferences, publications and fellowships.
