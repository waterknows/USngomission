Mountain States Children's Home (MSCH) extends Christian services to wounded children in an effort to meet their physical needs, heal their emotional hurts, challenge their minds and teach them moral principles, in order to reach the goals of reuniting them with their families or preparing for independence. This is accomplished utilizing a family model of care, strengthened by professional counselors and teachers. Denver church leaders founded an agency that became MSCH in 1960 resulting in the purchase of a 155-acre farm just north of Longmont on Highway 287. MSCH provides services to children in a rural setting and since that time four new homes have been built to house children.
