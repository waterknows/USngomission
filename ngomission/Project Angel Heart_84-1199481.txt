Founded in 1991, Project Angel Heart addresses the critical need for nutrition by providing home-delivered meals specifically designed to meet the heightened nutritional requirements of people battling life-threatening illnesses. We rely on crews of volunteers, working six days per week under the supervision of a professional chef, to prepare, cook, and package our meals in our own kitchen. We prepare our meals using only the freshest ingredients and we modify up to 60% of our meals each day to meet individual clients' dietary restrictions. Clients can receive up to the equivalent of three meals per day, depending on need as measured by the stage of disease, resources and the ability to access other sources of nutrition, like food banks.
