Since 1945, the United Way has helped Ventura County residents receive valuable health and human services by providing support to worthy causes and organizations. Although there are United Way organizations in almost every part of the United States, each one is governed by its own local board and is completely autonomous from the United Way of America. The United Way of Ventura County is a volunteer-driven organization. This means that individuals living and working in the local community volunteer their time and expertise to set and monitor the direction in planning, policy decisions, and financial development of the United Way. United Way's Community Impact Fund is improving the health of Ventura County residents, building self-sufficiency, meeting basic needs, and providing connections to important resources.
