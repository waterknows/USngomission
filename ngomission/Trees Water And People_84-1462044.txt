Founded in 1998, Trees, Water & People (TWP) is dedicated to helping communities protect, conserve and manage the natural resources upon which their long-term well-being depends. This mission is guided by two core beliefs:- That natural resources are best protected when local people play an active role in their care and management; and - Preserving local trees, wetlands, and watersheds is essential for the ongoing social, economic, and environmental health of communities everywhere.
