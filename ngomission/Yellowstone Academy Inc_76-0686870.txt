Yellowstone Academy exists to promote human flourishing among Houston's neediest families. The school serves children from very low-income families with a program designed to provide the educational, spiritual, social, and practical resources they need to succeed. Yellowstone Academy uses a faith based, comprehensive approach to addressing the multi-dimensional challenges of poverty in the lives of children. Through education and intensive intervention, these children can break the cycle of intergenerational poverty and grow up to become responsible, productive adults.
