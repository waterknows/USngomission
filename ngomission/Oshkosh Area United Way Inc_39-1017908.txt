Oshkosh Area United Way (OAUW), a local nonprofit organization, was established in 1962. OAUW has evolved from its roots as a fundraising organization to a community convener which mobilizes local partners including businesses, community leaders, public officials and residents, to develop opportunities for people to succeed. Our focus is on three key building blocks, a quality education that leads to a stable job, enough income to support a family and good health. OAUW helps to identify community needs, create solutions and fund local programs that deliver direct health and human services to the people in our community.
