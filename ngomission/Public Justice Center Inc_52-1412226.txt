The Public Justice Center (PJC) is a nonprofit legal advocacy organization in Maryland that focuses on systemic change for people who live in poverty. We work with people and communities to confront the laws, practices, and institutions that cause injustice, poverty, and discrimination. Morphing between a traditional legal services office representing clients, a policy campaign leader, and a community action collaborator, the PJC chooses its cases and projects based on whether we can have a significant impact on a law or practice affecting many people, and then we choose the strategies most likely to achieve that impact. We advocate in the courts, legislatures, and government agencies, educate the public and build coalitions, all to advance our mission of "pursuing systemic change to build a just society." Since 1985, the PJC has achieved remarkable results both locally and nationally.
