The San Diego Museum of Man is a cultural and physical anthropology museum. We collect, preserve, interpret, and communicate evidence of human development, creativity, and artistic expression. The exhibitions of the world-renowned Museum of Man are a major resource for the San Diego community. Permanent exhibits explore the Maya, ancient Egypt, the Kumeyaay Indians of San Diego County, Human Evolution, and the Human Life Cycle. Education is one of the primary functions of the Museum of Man. Through programs which offer engaging and stimulating experiences, the Museum creates a dynamic learning environment for children and adults. We are committed to promoting an understanding of the diverse cultures of the world, human biology, and human ecology through quality education programs.
