In 1947, a small group of paralyzed veterans living in the local area formed the New England Chapter Paralyzed Veterans of America (NEPVA). NEPVA is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt non-profit organization that represents the interests and concerns of paralyzed veterans and other individuals with disabilities throughout the New England area. The organization currently has over 1,000 members and continues to grow. The organization's primary focus is veterans' issues, notably quality healthcare for veterans with spinal cord injuries and dysfunction (SCI/D) such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS). NEPVA is interested in all issues affecting the lives of persons with disabilities. NEPVA routinely works with other community civic groups and agencies and has always been a strong advocate for accessibility to all aspects of life that are available to the general population.
