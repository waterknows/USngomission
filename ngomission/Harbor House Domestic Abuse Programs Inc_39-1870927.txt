Established in 1984 as a program of the Outagamie County Department of Human Services, Harbor House Domestic Abuse Programs began as a grassroots organization offering a safe shelter and basic crisis services to women and children hurt by domestic abuse. The mission of Harbor House is to lead a community-wide partnership in the prevention of domestic violence and abuse, and to offer safety and support to diverse families in crisis. To achieve this, Harbor House operates several programs including a shelter program, children's program, women's program, community education program, domestic violence intervention program and volunteer program.
