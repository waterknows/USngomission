Founded in 2007, The Mission Continues empowers veterans facing the challenge of adjusting to life at home to find new missions. We redeploy veterans in their communities, so that their shared legacy will be one of action and service. We focus the innate spirit of service demonstrated by the men and women of the US military. We mobilize wide-ranging support from volunteers, non-profit organizations and donors and together we are able to solve some of the most challenging issues facing our communities. Through this unique model that provides reciprocal benefit for the veteran and the local community, veterans volunteer to help others and, through their service, build new skills and networks that help them successfully transition home.
