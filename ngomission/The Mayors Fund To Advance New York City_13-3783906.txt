Established in 1994, the Mayor's Fund to Advance New York City serves as an important vehicle for foundations, corporations and individuals to contribute to public programs and enhance the City's ability to serve its residents. Since government can't do it all, the Mayor's Fund is committed to making a meaningful difference in the lives of New Yorkers with the help of private sector partners. The Fund invests private donations in programs to support innovation and emerging needs, while evaluating their effectiveness and feasibility of future public funding. The Mayor's Fund brings people together to fill vital needs, support innovative new initiatives, and help make New York an even more vibrant and dynamic place to live and work.
