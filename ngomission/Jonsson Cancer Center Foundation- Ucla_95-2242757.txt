The Jonsson Cancer Center Foundation (JCCF) is a public benefit corporation that exists for the express purpose of raising and distributing funds to support leading-edge cancer research at UCLA's Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center (JCCC). The JCCF was founded in 1945 by a group of volunteers dedicated to cancer research at UCLA. Their idea, using funds raised from private sources to invest in the work of promising young cancer researchers, resulted in the Seed Grant Program, which has helped the JCCC break new ground in the quest to defeat cancer. Although seed grants remain an important part of JCCF's mission, the Foundation today also supports numerous high-priority, multi-disciplinary cancer research efforts focused on rapidly translating discoveries made in the laboratory into improved screening, treatment and prevention.
