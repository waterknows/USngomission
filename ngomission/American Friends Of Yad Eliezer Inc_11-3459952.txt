American Friends of Yad Eliezer provides financial aid and support to Yad Eliezer. Yad Eliezer, founded in 1980, is the largest poverty relief agency in Israel. Yad Eliezer's mandate is to help families cope with financial difficulties and to empower them to break through the cycle of poverty and achieve self-sufficiency. Our objective is to combat poverty at its root, through an array of programs that provide critical short-term relief, while facilitating long-term recovery. Each component of Yad Eliezer's comprehensive welfare system - nationwide distribution of essential food, clothing and household items, job training, and adolescent mentoring programs - contributes toward economic recovery and social development.
