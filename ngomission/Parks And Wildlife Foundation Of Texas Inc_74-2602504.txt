Founded in 1991, Texas Parks and Wildlife Foundation is the nonprofit funding partner of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD). The Foundation's mission is to provide private support to TPWD to manage and conserve the natural and cultural resources of Texas and to provide hunting, fishing, and outdoor recreation opportunities for the use and enjoyment of current and future generations. The Foundation funds projects supported by sound science with measurable results and meaningful impact. Private funding, secured by the Foundation through gifts and grants, addresses critical conservation needs; improves and expands natural areas, state parks, and wildlife management areas; and enhances opportunities to enjoy and appreciate the abundance of natural beauty throughout Texas. Since its inception, the Foundation has raised over $100 million to ensure every Texan, today and in the future, can enjoy, explore, and be inspired by the incredible wild things and wild places in Texas.
