The Mississippi Center for Justice opened its doors in 2003, giving Mississippi a critical capacity for social change: a home grown, non-profit public interest law firm that pursues racial and economic justice through advocacy for systemic change. The Mississippi Center for Justice carries out its mission through a community lawyering approach that advances specific social justice campaigns in partnership with national and local organizations and community leaders. The Mississippi Center for Justice has three offices in Mississippi, located in Jackson, Indianola and Biloxi. Staffed by a team of attorneys, advocates and others, the Mississippi Center for Justice is dedicated to developing policies and strategies that combat discrimination and poverty throughout Mississippi. The Center engages the services of pro bono attorneys from across the United States.
