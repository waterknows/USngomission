At Midtown Educational Foundation (MEF,) we seek to impact the future of Chicago education by offering high-quality enrichment opportunities for students and their parents through our unique, holistic approach to after-school and summertime programs at the Midtown Center for boys and Metro Achievement Center for girls. The Midtown-Metro experience is highlighted by a curriculum that combines academics, character education and enriching extracurricular opportunities in business, technology, the arts and more. MEF also encourages the parents of its students to be actively involved in their child's educational and personal development. Finally, a corps of more than 350 weekly volunteer tutors and mentors helps our Chicago urban youth achieve college enrollment at a rate of nearly five times that of their peers nationwide.
