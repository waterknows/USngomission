Established in 1997, the Yellowstone to Yukon Conservation Initiative (Y2Y) is connecting and protecting habitat from Yellowstone to Yukon so people and nature can thrive. As a connector, Y2Y serves as an alliance-building force, scientific warehouse, and funding ally for groups and individuals doing on-the-ground conservation work. Our goal is to maintain and sustain this region in a way that allows wilderness, wildlife, native plants, and natural processes to function as an interconnected web of life. This is as much for the benefit of future generations as it is for the land, the wildlife, and the people currently living in the region. Y2Y is a joint Canadian-US network of over 300 organizations, institutions, foundations, and conservation-minded individuals.
