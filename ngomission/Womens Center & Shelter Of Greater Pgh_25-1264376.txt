Founded in 1974 by Ellen Berliner and Anne Steytler, Women's Center & Shelter of Greater Pittsburgh (WC&S) was one of the first six shelters in the United States for battered women. Since that time, WC&S has been at the forefront of the Battered Women's Movement, creating and implementing innovative and effective programming aimed at preventing domestic violence and providing services to domestic violence victims. In the 2010-2011 Fiscal Year, Women's Center provided over 10,943 services to 6,000 individuals - women, children and some men - who utilized our domestic violence services. Domestic violence has been ongoing throughout the ages, all over the world; it wasn't until the early 1970s that domestic violence was even given a name and recognized as a national problem.
