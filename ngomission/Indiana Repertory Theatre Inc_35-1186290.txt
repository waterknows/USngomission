Since the Indiana Repertory Theatre (IRT) was founded in 1972, it has grown into one of the leading regional theatres in the country, as well as one of the top-flight cultural institutions in the city and state. The IRT's mission is to produce top-quality, professional theatre and related activities, providing experiences that engage, surprise, challenge and entertain people throughout their lifetimes, thereby helping to build a vital and vibrant community. The IRT remains the only fully professional not-for-profit resident theatre in the state, providing 124,700 live professional theatre experiences for its audience last season. These experiences included 49,300 students and teachers from 60 of Indiana's 92 counties, making the IRT one of the most youth-oriented professional theatres in the country.
