Give Kids The World exists only to fulfill the wishes of all children with life-threatening illnesses and their families from around the world to experience a memorable, joyful, cost-free visit to the Central Florida attractions, and to enjoy the magic of Give Kids The World Village for as long as there is a need. Each day, Give Kids The World lives by this mission and has made a promise to never turn a child away. Since 1986, more than 122,000 children have had their dream come true at Give Kids The World. Through the tireless support of our volunteers, employees and generous partners, we dedicate each and every day to these special families.
