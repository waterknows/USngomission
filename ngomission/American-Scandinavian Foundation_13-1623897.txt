The American-Scandinavian Foundation (ASF) promotes international understanding through educational and cultural exchange between the United States and Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden. Incorporated in 1911, the ASF carries on an extensive program of fellowships, grants, trainee placement, publishing, membership offerings, and cultural activities. Over the years, more than 30,000 young Americans and Scandinavians have participated in ASF's exchange programs of study, research or practical training. Many of its alumni have gone on to leading positions in business, government and the arts. Through these programs, the ASF cultivates enduring academic, professional, and personal ties between the U.S. and the Nordic countries.
