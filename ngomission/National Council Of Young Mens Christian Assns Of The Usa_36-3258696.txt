The National Council of YMCAs of the USA (YMCA of the USA) is the national resource office for the nation's YMCAs. Located in Chicago, with satellite offices across the country, the YMCA of the USA exists to serve YMCAs. America's 2,686 YMCAs serve more than 21 million people each year, uniting men, women and children of all ages, races, faiths, backgrounds, abilities and income levels. At the heart of community life across America, mission-driven YMCAs are a place to belong and to live the values that guide and unite our members: caring, honesty, respect and responsibility. From cities to suburbs to small towns, YMCAs serve America's children, families and communities by building healthy spirit, mind and body for all.
