Founded in 1981, the All Stars Project (ASP) is a non-partisan organization dedicated to promoting human development through the use of an innovative performance and development based model. The ASP creates outside of school, educational and performing arts activities for thousands of poor and minority young people. It sponsors community and experimental theatre, develops leadership training and pursues volunteer initiatives that build and strengthen communities. Our programs include the All Stars Talent Show Network, the Joseph A. Forgione Development School for Youth, and the Castillo Theatre.
