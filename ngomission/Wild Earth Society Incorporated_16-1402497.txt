Since our founding in 1991, the Wildlands Network has been fostering a new kind of conservation movement that fills people with hope. Wildlands Network represents networks of people protecting networks of land. Our focus is to restore, protect and connect North America's best wild places. Our international network of conservation partners and individuals work to make sure nature has enough room to roam, to survive for the long-term.
