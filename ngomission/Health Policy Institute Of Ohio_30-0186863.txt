The Health Policy Institute of Ohio (HPIO) serves as Ohio's nonpartisan, independent source for forecasting health trends, analyzing key health issues, and communicating current research to policymakers, state agencies and other decision-makers. Since its founding in 2003, HPIO has become the state's trusted source of information and leadership on health policy issues. In the past, Ohio decision makers often had to rely on data and analysis provided by interest groups with particular perspectives and agendas. HPIO's mission is to provide nonpartisan, unbiased research, analysis and communication that enables policymakers to make the most informed decisions possible on matters that affect the health of all Ohioans.
