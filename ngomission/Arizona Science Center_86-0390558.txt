The mission of the Arizona Science Center (ASC) is to inspire, educate, and entertain people about science. Located in downtown Phoenix, the Arizona Science Center features more than 300 hands-on exhibits, a state-of-the-art planetarium, a five-story giant-screen theater, live demonstrations, traveling exhibitions, and exciting science programs for people of all ages. The ASC was originally opened by members of the Junior League of Phoenix in 1984 as the Arizona Museum of Science and Technology, and provided hands-on science learning to more than 750,000 children and adults during its 13-year history. Construction of a new facility began in 1994 and the new ASC opened to the public in April 1997.
