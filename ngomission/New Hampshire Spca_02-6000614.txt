The New Hampshire SPCA (NHSPCA) is a community resource center bringing animals and people together. We provide adoption, education, investigation and sheltering services in a professional and compassionate way. The NHSPCA serves over 121 communities in the seacoast of New Hampshire, southern Maine and northern Massachusetts. Our Adoption Center receives almost 3,000 unwanted, neglected or abused animals in our region each year. We provide each one with a warm bed, loving care and take every step possible to place them in the best possible new home. We also provide behavior training for pets, humane education and community programs, and cruelty investigations and advocacy.
