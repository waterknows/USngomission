Founded in 1993, Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy (LAANE) is committed to building a new economy that restores the American dream of fair wages and benefits in return for hard work. We believe that jobs in growing industries which cannot be exported, including those in the fast-growing service sector, must serve as the foundation for rebuilding a strong and vibrant middle class. LAANE has created an exciting new model for improving the lives of working men and women and building healthy communities. LAANE came to prominence by leading the effort to pass one of the country's first living wage laws, raising wages for 10,000 workers.
