Founded in 1986, the Pinellas Education Foundation has raised more than $95 million to support the students and teachers of Pinellas County Schools. The Pinellas Education Foundation is passionately committed to providing all students with the opportunity to be successful. It is our belief that we must have a superior educational system to ensure that our school children remain competitive in an increasingly global marketplace. The Foundation is a coalition of business and community leaders who work together to improve the quality of public education. They do this by advocating for public education reform, creating programs to improve student and teacher performance, and raising funds for scholarships, grants and teacher recognition.
