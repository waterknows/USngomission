Hudson River Sloop Clearwater preserves and protects the Hudson River, its tributaries and related bodies of water. Clearwater conducts innovative environmental programs, advocacy and celebrations in order to inspire and energize the next generation of environmental leaders. Clearwater was founded in 1969 by music legend and environmental activist Pete Seeger. The organization began with the launch of sloop Clearwater - a majestic replica of the sloops that sailed the Hudson in the 18th and 19th centuries. Since the launch of the Clearwater, more than half a million young people and hundreds of thousands of adults have experienced their first real look at an estuary's ecosystem aboard the sloop. Each summer, Clearwater re-connects Hudson Valley residents with their cultural heritage and traditions by bringing them down to the river for the Great Hudson River Revival.
