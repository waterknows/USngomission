The Sword of the Lord was founded in Dallas, Texas in 1934. Building a solid foundation of fundamental New Testament Christianity, we are committed to the unchanging Gospel which has always been our strength and our guide. The Sword of the Lord sees thousands of people saved every year through various Sword ministries. Over 100 sermons, as preached by outstanding pastors and evangelists of past and present, are found within THE SWORD newspaper each year. Each issue provides a strong defense of the Faith against modernism and compromise. We also publish Christian literature in hardback, paperback, tracts and booklet form.
