The Northeast Animal Shelter, established in 1976, is one of New England's largest animal shelters that does not destroy any of the pets entrusted to its care. We have placed thousands of dogs and cats since we opened our doors. Our programs include: Puppies Across America, rescuing abandoned puppies from across the U.S.; Sato Rescue, rescuing dogs from Puerto Rico; Spay/Neuter Assistance, breaking the cycle of unwanted animals; Humane Education Program, teaching schoolchildren how to be responsible and loving pet owners; Foster Care Program, where loving foster parents often mean the difference between life and death; the Senior Visitation Program, bringing animals to visit nursing homes and other special needs facilities; and children's birthday parties with the animals.
