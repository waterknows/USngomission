For over 50 years, Catholic Charities of Santa Clara County has changed lives for good by helping strengthen families and building economic self-sufficiency. Each year we serve 27,000 poor and vulnerable individuals of all cultures and beliefs through a broad base of programs including housing services, job skills training and placement, older adult services, mental health and substance abuse counseling, financial education, immigration, refugee resettlement, and children and youth services and education. Our compassion and commitment extend beyond direct service to those in need, and compel us to address the root causes of poverty in Santa Clara County through our social policy education and advocacy efforts.
