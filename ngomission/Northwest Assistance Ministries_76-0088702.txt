The concept of Northwest Assistance Ministries (NAM) was presented as a community service project to the Northwest Clergy Association in April 1983. A little more than six months later, NAM began operations with a small Food Pantry, Assistance Program and Resale Shop. Today, NAM is a multi-program, community-based social services agency. NAM's mission is to strive to meet basic human needs through neighbors helping neighbors. Our goal is to serve in a spirit of humility and charity and to enable people toward independence while respecting racial, cultural, and religious differences.
