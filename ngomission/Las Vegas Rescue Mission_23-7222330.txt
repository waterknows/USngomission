The Las Vegas Rescue Mission was founded in 1970 by a group of six businessmen who had a burden to help those who were homeless and hungry. Today, the Rescue Mission is composed of various buildings, taking up two city blocks near downtown Las Vegas. Through feeding the hungry, support, care, and an introduction to a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, we provide redemption, recovery, and re-entry to the homeless, addicted, and those in need. We now serve approximately 30,000 meals a month. The Mission stands as a beacon of hope. Through effective, innovative Christian recovery programs, the Las Vegas Rescue Mission provides a path for those who want to escape the despair of the streets. We continue to add, update and/or change programs to meet the needs of men, women and children in an ever-changing society.
