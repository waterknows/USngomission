The Mattress Factory is a museum of contemporary art that exhibits room-sized works called installations. Created

on site by artists from across the country and around the world, our unique exhibitions feature a variety of media that engage all of the senses. The Museum's unusual galleries are located in two creatively reused buildings on Pittsburgh's historic North Side. Both buildings house a growing-and distinctive- permanent collection, featuring

artists James Turrell, Yayoi Kusama, Winifred Lutz and Rolf Julius, as well as innovative exhibitions that change throughout the year. Since 1977, the Mattress Factory has supported more than 500 artists through our world-renowned residency program. Each year artists come to Pittsburgh, live at the museum, and create new work.
