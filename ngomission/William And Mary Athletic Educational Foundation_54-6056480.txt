The mission of The Tribe Club is to support the athletic department of the College of William & Mary. William and Mary athletic teams set the standard for academic excellence. In the most recent NCAA survey on graduation rates, William and Mary athletic teams set the standard for academic excellence. 13 of the 21 teams measured had a 100 percent graduation success rate. The Tribe's athletic accomplishments do not come at the expense of its student-athlete's academic responsibilities, as William and Mary had five teams rank in the top 10 percent of their sport for Academic Progress Rates among all Division I programs and received a Public Recognition Award by the NCAA.
