 The Champaign County Humane Society (CCHS) was established as a branch of the Illinois Humane Society in 1889 and chartered as the Champaign County Humane Society in 1903. In 1951, a diverse group of local citizens who cared deeply about animals gathered together to establish our first animal shelter near Bondville, Illinois, and in June of 1988 we moved into our current shelter in Urbana. We are an open door shelter and accept all animals in need, regardless of age, physical condition or adoptability. Each year, CCHS cares for over 5,000 homeless pets through a comprehensive animal welfare program.
