Planned Parenthood Association of Utah is committed to providing accurate information to individuals of all ages concerning the emotional and physical aspects of human sexual behavior and reproduction; providing affordable, high quality reproductive health care services; and protecting and advocating for the rights of individuals to understand and manage their own reproductive lives. Since 1970, Planned Parenthood Association of Utah has established a reputation in our community as a premier provider of quality family planning, education and reproductive health care for all Utah residents. To this day, it is still PPAU's mission to promote responsible sexual behavior and to reduce the physical, emotional and social costs of unplanned and unwanted pregnancy. With this in mind PPAU now operates nine health care centers and has many contract rural providers throughout Utah.
