The Figge Art Museum actively serves the public by promoting appreciation and creation of visual art through education, and by collecting, conserving and exhibiting art. As a vital, responsive institution, the Museum brings art and people together, expands the knowledge and love of art, and enriches the life of the community through the power of art. The Figge Art Museum is the premier art exhibition and education facility between Chicago and Des Moines. With soaring glass walls reflecting the constantly changing sky, the museum's expansive galleries and intimate rooms are home to some of the Midwest's finest art collections. Studio-style classrooms allow young and old to participate in the creative process.
