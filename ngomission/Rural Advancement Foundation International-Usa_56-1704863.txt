The Rural Advancement Foundation International - USA (RAFI-USA) cultivates markets, policies and communities that support thriving, socially just and environmentally sound family farms. While focusing on North Carolina and the southeastern United States, we also work nationally and internationally. RAFI is creating a movement among farm, environmental and consumer groups to ensure that: family farmers have the power to earn a fair and dependable income; everyone who labors in agriculture is respected, protected, and valued by society; air, water and soil are preserved for future generations; the land yields healthy and abundant food and fiber that is accessible to all members of society; and that the full diversity of seeds and breeds, the building blocks of agriculture, are reinvigorated and publicly protected.
