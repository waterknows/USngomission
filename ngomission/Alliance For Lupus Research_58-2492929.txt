The Alliance for Lupus research is dedicated to finding a cure for lupus. We believe in doing one thing, and doing it well. Founded in 1999, our sole mission is to prevent, treat and cure lupus through medical research. The Alliance applies a strategic business approach to funding research. In 2000 and 2001 we asked scientists to submit proposals to identify targets for new therapies in lupus. These proposals needed to be ideas that would lead to the development of new drugs or biologic agents to treat lupus within two years. And because we want to fund the best research, wherever that may be, we accepted applications from all over the world, and from industry, as well as academia.
