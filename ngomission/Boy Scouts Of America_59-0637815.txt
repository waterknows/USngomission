Since 1910 the Boy Scouts of America has been providing a proven, character-building program to our nation's youth. The West Central Florida Council was established in 1917. Since our founding, the Council has delivered the Scouting program to hundreds of thousands of youth. Today the objectives of Scouting are accomplished through partnerships with community-based organizations that have goals compatible with those of the Boy Scouts. Our council has more than 250 partnerships with religious, educational, civic, fraternal and professional associations, as well as businesses and corporations. Through these partnerships, over 4,700 volunteer adult leaders are able to guide and mentor more than 21,000 youth.
