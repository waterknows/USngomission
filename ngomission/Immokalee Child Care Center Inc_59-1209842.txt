Founded in 1964, Immokalee Child Care Center (ICCC) is a nationally accredited early childhood education center located in the rural farming community of Immokalee, Florida. ICCC creates a positive, nurturing environment where relationships are strengthened, children are encouraged, and families are able to lay a strong, healthy foundation for their children. Many children are left in inappropriate settings and miss out on the learning and social interaction necessary to prepare them for the onset of public school. Our goal is to make a difference in the children in Immokalee by offering partial tuition assistance/scholarships for parents in need. ICCC provides child care services for approximately 100 children per week.
