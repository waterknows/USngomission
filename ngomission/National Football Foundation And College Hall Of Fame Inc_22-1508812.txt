Founded in 1947, the mission of the National Football Foundation is to promote and develop the power of amateur football in developing the qualities of leadership, sportsmanship, competitive zeal and the drive for academic excellence in America's young people. We fulfill this mission by inspiring young people to excellence, exciting young people about the game, and developing and promoting model football programs. We hold up the greatest players and coaches in the history of the game as role models and enshrining them and their achievements in the College Football Hall of Fame.
