North Shore Country Day School is a JK-12 community rooted in tradition that challenges each member to develop a passion for active, life-long learning and respect for others. Committed to academic excellence, the partnership of students, faculty, parents and alumni fosters intellectually curious, independent and critical thinkers. We embrace diversity, knowing we are enriched by different backgrounds, voices and talents. The full participation of each student in academics, athletics, arts and activities is a core value. We develop self-confident, ethical citizens of the world who embody our motto, Live and Serve. Since our founding in 1919, North Shore has been an exceptional environment for teaching and learning.
