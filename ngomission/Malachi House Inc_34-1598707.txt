Malachi House, created out of a Christian sense of ministry, serves persons who are terminally ill, at no cost or regard to gender, race, religion or national origin. Our Home ministers to individuals who need an available caregiver, who have limited or no financial resources and are in need of special home care in the final stages of life. Our Home maintains a pure mission- to meet our residents' immediate and basic human needs of food, shelter, clothing and comfort. Our trained staff and volunteers provide spiritual, emotional and physical support with the assistance of a hospice team.
