Founded in 1917, Home Sweet Home Ministries serves Christ by providing food, shelter and hope to the hungry, homeless and hurting. We provide case management and other supportive services to the homeless such as shelter, hot meals, clothing and toiletries, addiction recovery, and children's programming. We also offer educational and vocational training, counseling and weekly worship services. Our goal is to help people find independence, restore their hope and share the love of Jesus Christ with them.
