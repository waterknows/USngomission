Founded in 1980, Ronald McDonald House Charities of San Diego provides a 'home away from home' to families with children being treated for serious, often life-threatening conditions at local hospitals. Following treatment protocols and keeping up with bills is hard enough without having to find meals and a place to stay far from home. We help ease these burdens, take care of basic needs, and offer support to families as they cope with serious illness. We just opened a greatly expanded new House where we will serve 15,000 family members each year, up from 3,500 at the old location. We now serve day visitors as well as resident guests with a comprehensive, first-of-its-kind Family Care Center. Our House is open to any family with a child in a local hospital.
