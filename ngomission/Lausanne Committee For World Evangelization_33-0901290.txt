Lausanne Committee for World Evangelization's mission is to encourage and stimulate the involvement of denominations, churches, ministries, & individuals in the cause of World Evangelization through regional & international gatherings to discuss critical issues facing the church and publishing the results of these meetings. The Lausanne Website allows leaders to access current and historical information on global evangelization, learn about national, regional and international gatherings on evangelization and share theological and practical studies and research.
