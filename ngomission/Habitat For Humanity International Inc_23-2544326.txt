Seeking to put God's love into action, Habitat for Humanity of the Lehigh Valley brings people together to build homes, communities and hope. Founded in 1989, Habitat for Humanity of the Lehigh Valley works in partnership with people from all walks of life and a variety of faith communities to build and renovate houses so that people in need can live in decent houses, in safe communities and grow into all that God intended. We work with the community to change the community, one home, one family at a time. We build new or renovate damaged homes by drawing the community together through support of donated materials, contributed dollars and giving hands. Habitat Lehigh Valley seeks and works with local disadvantaged families willing to work for their home. We provide mentoring and homeownership skills to help those families succeed as homeowners.
