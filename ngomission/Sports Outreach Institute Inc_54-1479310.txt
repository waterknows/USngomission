The mission of Sports Outreach Institute (SOI) is to identify and train committed Christian leadership in the effective use of sports ministry, in the spreading of the Gospel message, and in alleviating human suffering. Founded in 1988 with the goal of reaching the poorest communities around the world through the love and eternal hope of the Gospel of Jesus, God has grown SOI to now encompass over 100 staff members in ministry locations throughout the U.S., Latin America and Africa. SOI maintains five major projects: sports ministry, teaching, feeding, training and public health.
