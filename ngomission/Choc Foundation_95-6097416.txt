The CHOC Foundation for children exists to generate community awareness and resources for Children's Hospital of Orange County (CHOC) and CHOC at Mission, supporting specific strategies that underscore the hospitals' local and national leadership in prevention, treatment and research programs. CHOC Foundation for Children's fundraising activities are guided by six philanthropic aspirations: to provide quality medical care for all children; to treat chronic and catastrophic illnesses; to emphasize illness and injury prevention; to support the well-being of children; to achieve medical breakthroughs; and to serve as a community leader and partner in the care of children.
