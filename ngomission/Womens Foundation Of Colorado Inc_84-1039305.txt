The Women's Foundation of Colorado's (WFCO) mission is to build resources and lead change so that the women and girls of Colorado are full and equal participants in society. Our goal is that every woman in Colorado is economically self-sufficient, and every girl in Colorado is on the path to economic self-sufficiency. WFCO focuses its efforts on: an interactive and collaborative grantmaking process; and on research, education, advocacy, and collaboration. A catalyst for social change since 1987, WFCO has built an endowment of over $11 million, and has invested more than $9 million with 180 agencies in 75 communities statewide.
