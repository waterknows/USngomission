Ronald McDonald House Charities of North Carolina (RMHC of NC) is all about improving the lives of children. We believe that when you make a positive impact on the life of a single child, you create an amazing halo effect that extends from the family to the community and ultimately, the world. We carry out this vision by seeking to identify, create and support programs that directly benefit the health and well-being of children and families in North Carolina. Since 1992, we have proudly built upon this legacy of renewing lives and communities.
