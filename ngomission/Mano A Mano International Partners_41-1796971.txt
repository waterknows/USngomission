Mano a Mano International mission is to create partnerships with impoverished Bolivian communities that improve health and increase economic well-being. We collaborate with our counterpart organizations in Bolivia to build sustainable solutions that improve quality of life for the long-term. All of our projects are more than just constructing a building; there is a huge focus on training, education, and continuing community and government support to ensure that projects are used for their intended purpose and that the level of service remains high. Our continuing health education program and community maintenance days are two examples.
