Defenders of Animal Rights is dedicated to eliminating cruelty to all animals. In 1988, our shelter opened in the middle of a 35.8 acre wildlife sanctuary in Northern Baltimore County. We hold adoptable animals for as long as it takes to find each and every one a forever home. We have adopted out almost 24,000 animals. Our adoption rate is about 97%. Defenders of Animal Rights offers a variety of programs to benefit both the animals and the community. They include a pet adoption center; wildlife and farm animal sanctuary; animal rescues and veterinary care; rehabilitation of abused, neglected and abandoned animals; low cost spay/neuter program; grief counseling; and humane education.
