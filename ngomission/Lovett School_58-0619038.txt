Founded in 1926 by Eva Edwards Lovett, The Lovett School continues today as a kindergarten through grade 12, independent, coeducational, college preparatory day school. It employs a comprehensive curriculum which seeks to develop the total child - intellectually, physically, spiritually, socially, aesthetically, and emotionally. Lovett values and encourages a sense of responsibility to God, respect for diversity, service to others, moral integrity, environmental awareness, and sensitivity to issues of global significance. In 1991, Lovett purchased Siempre Verde, 520 acres of cloudforest property in Ecuador, for the purpose of creating a protected preserve and establishing a research center to support tropical conservation education.
