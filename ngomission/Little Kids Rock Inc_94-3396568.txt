Little Kids Rock is a national nonprofit dedicated to unlocking children's inner music makers. Founded in 2002, Little Kids Rock has quickly become the largest free music education program in the USA, now bringing free, weekly music lessons to more than 225,000 public school children, through the efforts of more than 1,600 teachers volunteering in 29 cities nationwide. The organization partners with school districts to train public school teachers in its innovative Modern Band curriculum, and donates all of the instruments and resources necessary to teach popular music in a way that empowers students to experience rapid achievement. Little Kids Rock started as a schoolteacher's vision to give his students access to music education while diminishing budgets for the arts made that increasingly difficult. What began as a single after-school guitar class has since exploded into a national movement that to date has served more than 400,000 students. More info at www.littlekidsrock.org
