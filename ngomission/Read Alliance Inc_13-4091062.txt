Read Alliance (formerly Reading Excellence and Discovery Foundation) serves at-risk kindergarten and first graders by recruiting and training teens to provide structured one-to-one tutoring in reading. Read Alliance focuses on students in the early grades to prevent reading difficulties before they become barriers to future success. Our students average a full grade level improvement in reading while their teen tutors develop college, career and life skills. We have served more than 15,000 children and teens since our founding in 2000!
