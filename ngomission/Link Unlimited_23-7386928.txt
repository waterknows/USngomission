Founded in 1974, LINK Unlimited Scholars provides educational college preparatory opportunities for economically disadvantaged African American high school youth. In so doing, it integrates mentoring relationships, college readiness and leadership development to foster academic success, personal development and interracial understanding and harmony. LINK programs challenge each scholar academically and personally, compelling them to push beyond what they thought were their limits to reach higher levels of excellence.
