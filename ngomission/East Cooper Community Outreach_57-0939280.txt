East Cooper Community Outreach (ECCO) provides safety net services to our low income neighbors, while empowering them to create a better future for themselves, their families, and our communities. ECCO provides emergency assistance for food, clothing, household furnishings, and financial needs. ECCO also serves low-income residents with access to free health and dental care, prescription drug assistance, education, job preparedness, and counseling. All programs and services strive to guide clients toward self-sufficiency. ECCO's ministry of "Helping Neighbors Help Themselves" attempts to improve the quality of life in our community in a compassionate way that respects the dignity and worth of every person.
