Founded in 1972, N Street Village is a community of empowerment and recovery for homeless and low-income women in Washington, D.C. With comprehensive services addressing both emergency and long-term needs, we help women achieve personal stability and make gains in their housing, income, employment, mental health, physical health, and addiction recovery. Nearly 900 women use our programs each year, which include a drop-in day center, wellness center, education and employment center, clinical services, case management, and four residential programs ranging from temporary shelter to transitional and permanent supportive housing.
