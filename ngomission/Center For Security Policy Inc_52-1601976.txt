Founded in 1988, the Center for Security Policy is a non-partisan national security organization that specializes in identifying policies, actions, and resource needs that are vital to American security and then ensures that such issues are the subject of both focused, principled examination and effective action by recognized policy experts, appropriate officials, opinion leaders, and the general public. The philosophy of "Peace through Strength" is not a slogan for military might but a belief that America's national power must be preserved and properly used for it holds a unique global role in maintaining peace and stability. The role of the Center for Security Policy is to help our government, countrymen and other freedom-loving nations conceptualize, conduct and succeed on this front.
