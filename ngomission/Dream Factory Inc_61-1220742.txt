In 1980, the Dream Factory began with one all-volunteer chapter in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. Since then, the Dream Factory has grown into the second-largest children's wish-granting organization in the United States, granting over 25,000 dreams since its inception - all while maintaining a grassroots approach. The Dream Factory continues to operate all 38 of its local chapters with over 5000 very dedicated volunteers. The Dream Factory is the only children's wish-granting organization that does not limit its mission to children who have life-threatening illness. The organization believes children with chronic illnesses and disorders also suffer from substantial emotional and physical pain. We strive to provide hope and relief from the trauma and corresponding stress and depression that both the children and their families can endure on a day-to-day basis.
