The University of Pennsylvania traces its origins to 1740, and carries on the principles and spirit of its founder, Benjamin Franklin: entrepreneurship, innovation, invention, outreach, and a pragmatic love of knowledge. Today Penn is home to a diverse undergraduate student body of nearly 10,000, hailing from every state in the union and all around the globe. Another 10,000 students are enrolled in Penn's 12 graduate and professional schools, which are national leaders in their fields, including: the Wharton School, the School of Nursing, the School of Arts and Sciences, Graduate School of Education, Law School, School of Medicine, School of Veterinary Medicine, and Annenberg School for Communication, all of which rank among the top 10 schools in their fields.
