Incorporated in 1938, Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New Orleans offers life-giving programs, advocates for the voiceless and empowers the most vulnerable to foster a more just society. Prior to Hurricane Katrina, Catholic Charities operated more than 30 programs addressing such issues as hunger, poverty, unemployment, domestic violence, education and the needs of the mentally ill, low-income seniors and at-risk children. Today, we serve those whose lives have been changed forever by Hurricane Katrina, in addition to many of those we served before. We are currently operating more than 48 programs, several of which are geared directly toward hurricane recovery.
