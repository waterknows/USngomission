United Way of the Lakeshore advances the common good and creates opportunities for a better life for all by focusing on Education, Income and Health - the building blocks for a good life. There are basic things we all need for a good life: a quality education that leads to a stable job, income that can support a family through retirement, and good health. Our goal is to create long-lasting changes that prevent problems from happening in the first place. Our mission is to mobilize the caring power of our community to improve the lives of people in our lakeshore communities.
