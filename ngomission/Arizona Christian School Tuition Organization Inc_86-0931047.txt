Since it began in 1998, Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization (ACSTO) has awarded scholarships to more than 19,000 students attending 150 Arizona Christian schools. Over 50,000 visionary Arizona taxpayers have made this possible by donating to ACSTO, and taking advantage of Arizona's unique opportunity to receive a dollar-for-dollar credit against their Arizona state income tax. The goal of ACSTO is to further Christian education by effectively implementing the provisions of the Arizona private school tuition tax credit law for the benefit of Christian school students and their families.
