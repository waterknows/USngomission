The Families USA Foundation dedicated to the achievement of high-quality, affordable health care for all Americans. Working at the national, state, and community levels, we manage a grassroots advocates' network of organizations and individuals working for the consumer perspective. We act as a watchdog over government actions affecting health care, alerting consumers to changes and helping them have a say in the development of policy. We conduct public information campaigns about the concerns of health care consumers and serve as a consumer clearinghouse for information about the health care system.
