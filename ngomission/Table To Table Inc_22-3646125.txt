Table to Table is a community-based food rescue program that collects prepared and perishable food that would otherwise be wasted and delivers it to organizations that serve the hungry in Bergen, Hudson, Essex and Passaic counties. This fresh food is delivered free of charge to more than 75 agencies throughout the area, including elder care facilities, drug rehab centers, homeless shelters, homes for victims of domestic violence, HIV day centers, and pantries serving the working poor. Table to Table is the first and only food rescue program in Northeast New Jersey solely dedicated to redistributing prepared and perishable foods. In 2011 we delivered enough food for more than 8,000,000 meals.
