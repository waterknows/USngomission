The AIDS Community Research Initiative of America (ACRIA) was founded as the Community Research Initiative on AIDS (CRIA) in December 1991 by a group of physicians, activists, and people living with HIV who were frustrated by the slow pace of government and academic AIDS research. Since that time we have contributed to the development of more than a dozen medications that have received FDA approval, helping countless thousands of HIV-positive people live longer, healthier lives. ACRIA added a treatment education component to its efforts in 1997, offering group workshops and individual counseling on a variety of AIDS- and HIV-related topics.
