Founded in 1982, the mission of Speedway Children's Charities (SCC) remains true to the ideals it was founded upon in 1982: To care for children in educational, financial, social and medical need in order to help them lead productive lives. Because of the unique conditions in every community, the issues SCC address are determined locally. Challenges ranging from learning disabilities, broken homes, and childhood cancer are on the agenda for the local chapters of SCC and the numerous non-profit organizations they support. Although priorities for SCC are set locally, we have one common goal - to ensure every child in need be given the tools to build a better, brighter and healthy future.
