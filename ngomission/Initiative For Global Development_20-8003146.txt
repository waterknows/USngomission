Founded in 2006, Initiative for Global Development (IGD) works to engage corporate leaders in reducing global poverty through strategic, successful business investment. We bring together an influential network of senior executives from sector-leading companies with the interest and capacity to make strategic investments in high-need, high-potential areas of Africa. Members of our Frontier Leaders network shape global connections and frontier market insights, and promote business-driven development to create economic growth and opportunity.
