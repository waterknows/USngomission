Founded in 1977, Will Rogers Institute's mission is to perpetuate the memory of Will Rogers by promoting and engaging in medical research pertaining to cardio-pulmonary diseases and educating the general public on topics of health and fitness. Most of the Will Rogers Institute-sponsored research is conducted at our three research hospitals: Burke Rehabilitation Hospital, University of Southern California, and University of California, Los Angeles. The Institute also sponsors research fellowships in lung diseases at many major universities and medical centers throughout North America, thereby helping to train future leaders of lung research to serve our children and future generations. We also fund neonatal ventilators to needy hospitals across the country. As of 2002, we also have the Pioneers Assistance Fund which provides financial assistance for members of the motion picture industry (exhibition, distribution, trade services) who are facing an illness or life changing event.
