Cedar Valley Habitat for Humanity (CVHFH) is an ecumenical Christian housing ministry dedicated to building and rehabilitating simple, decent, and affordable homes in partnership with families in need in Linn and Benton counties. Partner families make a down payment, invest hundreds of hours of sweat equity into the construction of their homes and other Habitat homes, and make monthly mortgage payments on a zero-interest loan. Since 1988, Cedar Valley Habitat for Humanity has built or rehabilitated more than 110 homes. Cedar Valley Habitat plans to serve 25 families in 2013 through a combination of projects, including new construction, home rehabilitations and exterior painting/repair projects.
