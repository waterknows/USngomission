Founded in 1942, the Civic Garden Center of Greater Cincinnati is the second oldest non-profit civic garden center in the State of Ohio. The Center enriches lives through education, community beautification and environmental stewardship. It is an oasis in the city - eight beautifully landscaped acres open daily to visitors at no charge and located 2.5 miles from downtown Cincinnati. The Center provides education and information to individuals, schools, organizations and businesses through its Horticulture Helpline, library, classes, hands-on workshops, tours, special events and outreach programs. Our Neighborhood Gardens program touches 23 communities with over 47 active gardens. Compost Kids and Summer Sprouts programs introduce young people to gardening.
