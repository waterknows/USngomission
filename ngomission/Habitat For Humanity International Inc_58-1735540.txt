Wichita Habitat for Humanity became an official affiliate of Habitat for Humanity International in October, 1986. Habitat for Humanity is a non-profit Christian housing ministry working in partnership with low-income families to improve the conditions in which they live. Habitat is not a giveaway program. Low-income families selected for Habitat houses must pay closing costs and monthly payments on a no interest, no profit mortgage.
