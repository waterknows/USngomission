The purpose of America's Keswick is to model and teach Biblical victorious living in Christ Jesus, to provide an environment in which Biblical life transformation takes place and to foster active personal involvement in the local church. America's Keswick is a multi-generational, cross-cultural ministry where biblical teaching and worship lead to deeper personal relationships with Jesus Christ and transform lives. We serve people with excellence through addiction recovery, conferences, retreats and outreach.
