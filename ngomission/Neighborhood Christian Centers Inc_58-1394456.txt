Founded in 1978, the primary mission of the Neighborhood Christian Centers is to build stronger families and neighborhoods by providing compassionate, Christ-centered ministries to those in need. At the core of our values is providing compassionate and Christ-centered ministry to those Christ came to serve: the oppressed, the hungry, the captive, the blind, the lowly, the alien, the orphan and the widow. As exemplified by Christ Himself, we believe that Christ-centered, compassionate ministry must address both physical and spiritual needs; therefore, our approach to ministry addresses the development of the whole person.
