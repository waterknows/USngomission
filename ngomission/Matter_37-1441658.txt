Matter is a non-profit organization that believes the simple act of being resourceful can change the world. By seeing a new purpose for what others cast off, we are able to partner with service organizations to deliver opportunities to those living in scarcity. It's our calling to create a world where we all matter.Since 2000 - when the organization began operating as "Hope for the City" - we have re-purposed valuable goods and distributed material resources to organizations serving those living in scarcity. Over the next 15 years, we have evolved to become an organization that has helped distribute more than $550 million in wholesale goods to people in need all over the world. And that was just the beginning.Through the simple act of being resourceful, we are addressing the needs of people living in scarcity while creating a better world - a world where we all matter.
