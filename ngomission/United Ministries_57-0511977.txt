United Ministries provides life changing opportunities and advocacy for people in our community who lack education or employment skills, who are in financial crisis, who are homeless, and those who can help. We will achieve our mission by uniting the faith-based, public, and private communities to provide the tangible and intangible resources required for quality programs; educating communities about the needs and realities of people served by United Ministries; working with integrity and transparency; and providing quality programs which address real needs. The work of United Ministries is carried out primarily through its four programs: Emergency Assistance, the Place of Hope, Employment Readiness, and Adult Education.
