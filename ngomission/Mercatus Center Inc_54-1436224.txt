For over 25 years, the Mercatus Center at George Mason University has sought to bridge the gap that often exists between economic understanding and real-world decision making. Mercatus applies scholarly research to the problems facing policy makers. Bringing together a network of scholars and experts from around the globe, the Mercatus Center provides policy makers with the economic tools to make sense of today's most pressing issues. Mercatus turns ideas into action. Capitol Hill Campus is the central outreach program of the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. The program bridges the gap between scholarship and policy by making academic research and methods available to policy makers, and grounding academics by making them aware of policy makers' need for relevant analysis of public policy issues.
