Redwood Gospel Mission serves Sonoma County and the Santa Rosa metropolitan area. The Mission has been offering help and hope for the homeless, hungry, and those caught in addictions since 1963. More than just a soup kitchen, we are located on four sites in Santa Rosa, which encompass a men's mission and homeless Shelter, a women's mission, a women's homeless shelter, and our administrative offices, the Ministry Support Center. In addition, we have a thrift store, open six days a week. We are a proud member of the Association of Gospel Rescue Missions.
