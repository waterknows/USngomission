Founded in 1997, the mission of Amigos de Jesus is to be Friends of Jesus and, therefore, to imitate the behavior and attitude of Jesus Christ for the children of Amigos de Jes√∫s. We accept abandoned, abused and impoverished children with the hope of respecting and enhancing their spiritual, physical, emotional, social and intellectual growth within their country of origin. We aspire toward self-sustainability for both the orphanage and the children who graduate. We believe we are also disciples of these children and will be humbly transformed by the presence of Jesus Christ in the children.
