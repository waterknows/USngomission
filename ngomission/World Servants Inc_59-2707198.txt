Founded in 1986, World Servants works to mobilize a global network of people to impact the world for Jesus Christ through responding to physical and spiritual needs. Through training and short-term mission experiences, our desire is to develop people as both servants and leaders in their everyday lives. We believe these learning opportunities will result in the transformation of individuals and communities across the globe. In the past 20 years World Servants has mobilized more than 40,000 people who have served in over 50 individual communities globally.
