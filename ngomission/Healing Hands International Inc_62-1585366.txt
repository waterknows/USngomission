Incorporated in 1994, Healing Hands International (HHI) works to save lives and relieve suffering through the distribution of humanitarian aid in order to bring hope to all people, to provide information and awareness of worldwide medical and humanitarian needs; thus, providing a broader opportunity for contributors and volunteers, to ship to areas where God receives the glory and the local church receives the recognition, and to work in the unity of the spirit and the bond of peace with churches of Christ and their church related ministries. HHI has shipped to over 70 different countries in need. With a total number of over 300 shipments, it is easy to see God's hand at work in the ministry.
