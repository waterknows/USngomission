HomeFront helps qualified, low-income homeowners who are physically or financially challenged to maintain their residence by providing free home repairs through teams of volunteers. The goal of HomeFront is to provide free home repairs for homes and community centers focusing on the neediest circumstances. Our program staff and volunteers work hand-in-hand with homeowners to provide those repairs that will be the most meaningful to them and have the greatest impact on their quality of life. Repairs may include carpentry, plumbing, electrical work, roofing, drywall, weatherproofing, window and door replacement, wheel chair ramps, installation of smoke detectors and fire extinguishers, painting, cleaning, and yard work.
