The oldest private college in Ohio, Kenyon College was founded in 1824 by Philander Chase. Kenyon is a private, residential liberal-arts college, which offers exceptional programs, opportunities to collaborate with faculty, and the ethos of a small and welcoming community. Kenyon's beautiful 1,000-acre campus is in Gambier, Ohio, 45 miles from the state's capital, Columbus. Fifty-three percent of Kenyon's 1,600 students are women; 47 percent are men. The student-faculty ratio is 10 to 1, and the most common class size is 15. There are 31 majors leading to a bachelor's degree. In addition, the College offers 10 concentrations; pre-professional advising for graduate or professional school in business, education, engineering, law, and medicine; and a number of cooperative programs involving other institutions.
