Founded in 1976 by two Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet, in a small storefront on Rose Avenue in Venice, St. Joseph Center, through its three decades of service to the community, has evolved into a multi-faceted social service agency that serves very poor, as well as homeless, families and individuals. St. Joseph Center is a significant presence on Los Angeles' Westside through its 10 programs at eight different locations, all of which continue to respond to the wide-ranging needs of homeless and low-income families and individuals in the community.
