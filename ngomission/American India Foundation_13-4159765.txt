The American India Foundation (AIF) is devoted to accelerating social and economic change in India. AIF has invested in over 100 Indian non-governmental organizations since its inception in 2001. AIF works with partners to implement programs in education, livelihood, and public health sectors in India - with emphases on elementary education, women's empowerment, and HIV/AIDS, respectively. AIF through its program Digital Equalizer attempts to bridge the digital divide by providing computers, internet access and training to improve learning and critical thinking amongst students of under-resourced Indian schools. It also implements the Service Corps Fellowship, which sends skilled young Americans to work with NGOs in India for a ten month period.
