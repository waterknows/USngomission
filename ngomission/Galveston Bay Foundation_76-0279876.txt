Since 1987, the Galveston Bay Foundation (GBF) has worked to preserve, protect and enhance the natural resources of the Galveston Bay estuarine system and its tributaries for present users and for posterity. To accomplish this mission the Foundation has targeted four goals: advocacy, conservation, education and research. As part of its conservation activities, GBF owns about 3,000 acres of property identified as having significant habitat or educational value. Galveston Bay Expeditions, GBF's outdoor education program, annually draws close to 1,000 participants who explore the Bay as part of youth, adult, family, or teacher expeditions. Thousands more are introduced to the Bay each year through GBF's Bay Day festival and celebration.
