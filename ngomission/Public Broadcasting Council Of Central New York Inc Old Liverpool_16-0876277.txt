The Public Broadcasting Council of Central New York operates non-commercial public television and radio stations. WCNY-TV first signed on the air in 1965 and public radio service was inaugurated on WCNY-FM Syracuse in 1971. Through a partnership with Time Warner Cable, in 1996, WCNY launched a full-time cable channel, WCNY2. This channel devotes its program schedule to how-to programs. As a service to our visually-impaired listeners, READ-OUT was started in 1982 so that listeners could use a special radio to hear volunteers reading newspapers, articles, and daily advertisements.
