Big Brothers Big Sisters A Community of Caring programs are designed to matches children ages 5 through 17 with mentors in professionally supported one-to-one relationships. Knowing that some truly cares about the decision that make is a gift that more than 1,800 children are receiving through our programs across southwest Michigan. We have programs in Allegan, Barry, Calhoun, Kalamazoo, and Van Buren counties. The mentoring programs and services to kids, parents and mentors are flexible and can happen in community, in schools, at businesses, in churches, in community centers or within other organizations.
