Cityteam serves the poor and homeless in San Jose, San Francisco, Oakland, Portland, Seattle, Philadelphia and partnerships in many countries around the world. Since 1957, Cityteam has provided life-saving food, shelter, clothing, recovery programs, youth outreach, camp for at-risk inner city kids, discipleship and other essential care 365 days a year. Cityteam reaches out to one person at a time to help meet their immediate needs and introduce them to the hope that only God can provide - so they can truly make real changes in their life. Each person we help can be the key to ending the cycle of poverty, homelessness and despair for a whole family.
