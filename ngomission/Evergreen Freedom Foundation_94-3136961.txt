Founded in 1991, the Freedom Foundation is a private public policy research organization in Washington state. Our mission is to advance individual liberty, free enterprise, and limited and accountable government. Our primary research areas are budget and taxes, education, health care, welfare, and citizenship and governance. Within those areas we publish studies, conduct seminars, and work to provide information for legislators, journalists and the general public. It is our core belief that a freedom loving people must understand the principles from which freedom is derived. Our objective, therefore, is to disseminate those key ideals and motivate the citizenry to act upon them.
