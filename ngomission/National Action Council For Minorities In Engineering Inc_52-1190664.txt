Since 1974, the National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering (NACME) has worked to help African American, American Indian, and Latino students achieve access to opportunities and success in engineering and technology careers. From the beginning, NACME has collaborated with business, industry, education, and community organizations to generate the resources necessary to allow economically disadvantaged students to complete their college educations. The centerpiece of our efforts is NACME Scholars. We distribute more than $4 million annually through block grants to university partners and as individual awards. Since our founding, NACME has given more than $114 million in scholarship and program support to 22,000 students, thus increasing the flow of talent entering the science, technology, engineering, and math professions.
