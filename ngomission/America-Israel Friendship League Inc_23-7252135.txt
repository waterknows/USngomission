The America-Israel Friendship League (AIFL) is a non-sectarian, non-political organization strengthening ties between the people of the United States and Israel; bridging distances to reveal the beauty, the humanity, and the modern democratic values that define both nations. With a special grassroots focus AIFL brings Americans of all creeds and ethnicities to Israel, and Israelis (Jews, Christians and Muslims) to the United States. Our unique Leadership Missions and Global Education programs go beyond the headlines, revealing the human face and the heart of Israel and Her people. The AIFL experience fosters personal connections for which no words or political actions alone can substitute.
