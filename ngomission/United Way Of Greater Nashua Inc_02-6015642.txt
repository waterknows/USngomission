United Way of Greater Nashua is an independent, non-profit organization controlled by our local donors. It was established in 1930 when business leaders helped raise $42,677 to assist local families who were suffering from the community's greatest problems of the time: the Great Depression and the aftermath of the Crown Hill fire. We've been here ever since, bringing together donors, businesses, non-profits, government, and faith-based communities to make our region a stronger, healthier place to live and work. We serve the communities of Amherst, Brookline, Hollis, Hudson, Litchfield, Lyndeborough, Merrimack, Milford, Mont Vernon, Nashua and Wilton.
