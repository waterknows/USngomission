Founded in 1997, the Women of Tomorrow Mentor & Scholarship Program (WOT) inspires, motivates and empowers young women to live up to their full potential through a unique mentoring program with highly accomplished professional women and scholarship opportunities. WOT is believed to be the only program of its kind in the country, pairing extremely accomplished professional women with small groups of at-risk teenage girls in public high schools for monthly mentoring sessions in a three to four year mentoring program. Women of Tomorrow currently operates in 43 Florida and 13 Metro Detroit cities serving over 2,500 at-risk young women annually in 130 public high schools with its network of over 350 highly accomplished professional women. Since the inception of its Scholarship Program in 2000, WOT has awarded over $3.2 million in scholarships to 1,186 WOT Mentees.
