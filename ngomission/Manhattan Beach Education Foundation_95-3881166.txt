The Manhattan Beach Education Foundation (MBEF) is a volunteer-based, nonprofit organization that raises money to improve and enhance the education provided in Manhattan Beach public schools. MBEF helps fill the gap between what the state provides the district and what it costs to provide a well-rounded, quality education for students.
