For 130 years, Humane Society of West Michigan has operated under a seemingly simple mission, one that we feel provides both animals and those who care for them with an irreplaceable resource. Our mission is to promote the humane treatment and responsible care of animals in West Michigan through education, example, placement and protection. Humane Society of West Michigan is a limited admission shelter. This means that we must restrict the number of animals we receive in order to continue providing the best care and shelter for our current animals.
