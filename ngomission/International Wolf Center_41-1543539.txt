The International Wolf Center advances the survival of wolf populations by teaching about wolves, their relationship to wildlands and the human role in their future. Our response to controversies as they arise is to provide information that helps people to make their own informed decisions. We pledge to educate the public by offering the most up-to-date, accurate wolf information possible. We who want knowledge about wolves need clear, thoughtful presentation of the facts and issues involved. That is exactly what the International Wolf Center seeks to provide. The study of wolf survival continues to include the study of human tolerance. It is hard for people to tolerate or to respect what they are raised to fear. The wolf problem is a people problem. We need everyone's help to solve it.
