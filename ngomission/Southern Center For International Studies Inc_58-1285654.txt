The Southern Center for International Studies (SCIS), founded in 1962, is an educational institution dedicated to increasing the public's awareness and understanding of other countries, international issues and the global environment. SCIS' primary mission is to internationalize the thinking of Americans. In accomplishing this mission, SCIS seeks to inform. It does not take political positions or attempt to influence policy. Since its inception, the Center has played a leading role in developing the international infrastructure that exists today in the southeastern region of the United States. The Center serves as a valuable resource for state, county, and city governments, chambers of commerce and other business and professional groups. The Center also works closely with educational institutions and civic organizations throughout the United States.
