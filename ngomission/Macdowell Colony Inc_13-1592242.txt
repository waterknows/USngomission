In 1907 The MacDowell Colony was founded with the mission to nurture the arts by offering creative individuals of the highest talent an inspiring environment in which they can produce enduring works of the imagination. The sole criterion for acceptance to The MacDowell Colony is artistic excellence. MacDowell defines excellence in a pluralistic and inclusive way, encouraging applications from artists representing the widest possible range of perspectives and demographics. In 1997, The MacDowell Colony was honored with the National Medal of Arts â€” the highest award given by the United States to artists or arts patrons.
