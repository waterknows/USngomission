Our mission is to ensure that Jewish children with a full range of learning styles, abilities and challenges succeed academically, socially, and spiritually to their fullest potential. We provide an array of state-of-the-art educational programs, supports and resources to meet the individual needs of each child in a variety of Jewish settings, including Jewish day schools and supplemental programs. We actively engage and collaborate with teachers and administrators to universalize best practices in education. We seek to educate parents, teachers, administrators and the broader community to promote understanding and acceptance of the children we serve. Gateways: Access to Jewish Education was formed in July 2006





To enable Jewish children with special educational needs to become successful participants in the Jewish community.
