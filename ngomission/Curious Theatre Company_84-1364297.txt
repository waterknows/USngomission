The mission of Curious Theatre Company is to engage the community in important contemporary issues through provocative modern theatre. Curious Theatre Company was founded by a group of artists who met 15 years ago while mounting Tony Kushner's Angels in America (produced by Hunger Artists) in the 19th-century church the theatre still calls home, a few blocks south of the Denver Art Museum and State Capitol. Under the artistic leadership of Producing Artistic Director Chip Walton, Curious produces up to five mainstage shows per season, the award-winning Curious New Voices education program, the fun and innovative Denver Stories (honoring area luminaries) and myriad of events and interactions that extend and enrich the experience of our audiences.
