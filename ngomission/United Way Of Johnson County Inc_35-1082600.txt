United Way of Johnson County's mission is to organize caring people to identify and meet human needs in our community. Our community is diverse economically and socially. Since our beginnings in 1961, our volunteers have made certain that our neighbors have meaningful lives. Our organization is responsible for looking at the needs of the community, raising the funds and allocating those funds appropriately in order to meet the pressing needs of Johnson County residents. United Way of Johnson County provides funding for 20 health and human-service agencies and 92 programs in our community.
