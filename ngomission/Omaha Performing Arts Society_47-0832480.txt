Founded in 2000, the Omaha Performing Arts Society (OPAS) is dedicated to enriching the lives of the citizens of Omaha and surrounding communities through the presentation of the finest local, national, and international artistic performances. Central to the organization's mission are education and community involvement programs that encourage young people and adults to more fully appreciate and participate in the performing arts. These programs include workshops, master classes, pre-performance and post-performance discussions with artists, and community-focused collaborations. As part of its charge, OPAS manages the Orpheum Theater and Holland Performing Arts Center. In addition, OPAS brings a variety of outstanding entertainers to both facilities through its presenting series Omaha Performing Arts Presents.
