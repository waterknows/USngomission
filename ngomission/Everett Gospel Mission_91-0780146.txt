Fifty years ago, the Everett Gospel Mission was established in downtown Everett to help homeless and "down and out" men turn their lives around and re-enter society. Today we are the largest Faith-Based Organization for homeless men, women and children in Snohomish, Skagit, Island and San Juan counties. Currently the only organization to provide emergency shelter to single men, we are also the larger of only two organizations providing emergency shelter to single women. At each of our four facilities, we promote accountability, motivation and Spiritual growth for those who wish to make long term life changes. We help women and men break the cycle of homelessness, poverty and dependence, and move toward a life of hope and promise. Everett Gospel Mission is open 365 days a year, offering three nutritious meals as well as overnight shelter to those who are in need.
