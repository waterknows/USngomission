International Planned Parenthood Federation/Western Hemisphere Region is a recognized leader in the international movement to ensure access to sexual and reproductive health care as a human right for all people.We believe that every individual is entitled to quality health care and a life free of violence and discrimination. We reach young people and poor communities with free or subsidized sexual and reproductive health services in a region characterized by high rates of adolescent pregnancy and extreme income inequality.In 2012, we provided nearly 33 million services-such as contraception and gynecological consultations-in nearly every country in the Americas and the Caribbean and helped safeguard 37 national policies and legislation in support of sexual and reproductive health and rights.
