The mission of McWane Science Center is to change lives through science and wonder. The Center is the cornerstone of Birmingham, Alabama's downtown revitalization. This state-of-the-art museum is housed in the historic and refurbished Loveman's department store building. In 1998, Discovery Place and Red Mountain Museum merged to create a stimulating interactive science museum now called McWane Science Center. Designed to inspire a life-long love of learning, McWane Science Center has welcomed millions of visitors since opening its doors in 1998. Explorers - from ages one to 100 - flock year-round to see, to hear, to touch, and to experience the wonder of science in one of the South's most unique venues.
