Founded in 1939, Heart of Florida United Way (HFUW) is Central Florida's largest charitable organization. Our mission is to improve lives by mobilizing the caring power of our communities. We seek to engage all citizens to work together to build healthy, safe, caring, and strong communities. In 2008, HFUW adopted a bold new strategic direction focused on prevention. Known as Investing in Results, the initiative is guiding United Way's work to move the needle in four critical impact areas: developing healthy children and families, building safe communities, increasing financial stability, and alleviating hunger and homelessness.
