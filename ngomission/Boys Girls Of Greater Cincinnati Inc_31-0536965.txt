Boys & Girls of Greater Cincinnati's mission is to foster the academic, social, and physical development of boys and girls, ages 6-18, with special emphasis on youth from disadvantaged circumstances. Our goal is for each Boys & Girls Club member to: Graduate from high school; Remain fit for life; Become engaged citizens of their club and community. BGCGC serves youth through a variety of after-school and summer programs including homework assistance, technology centers, teen centers, career exploration, job assistance, sports and recreation, art classes and leadership development.
