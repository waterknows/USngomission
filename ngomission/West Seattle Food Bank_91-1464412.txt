Founded in 1988, West Seattle Food Bank's (WSFB) mission is to provide food security and community connections to our neighbors in need. WSFB distributes food, baby food, baby supplies, books and other items to low-income residents of West Seattle. The WSFB has many partners assisting to secure food that will meet the special dietary needs and cultural preferences of the diverse population we serve. WSFB also collaborates to offer food distributions at other non-profit agencies in the area.
