The Sheepfold works to equip mothers with children suffering from homelessness or abuse for successful independent living with hope for the future. A key outcome is that they can live on their own independently and not be tempted to return to their abuser and destructive lifestyle. We first opened our doors to homeless, abused and forsaken women with children in October 1979. Since that time thousands women and their children have found shelter, safe refuge and a new beginning in life as a result of the Sheepfold ministry.
