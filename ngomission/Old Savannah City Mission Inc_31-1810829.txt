The Old Savannah City Mission is Gospel ministry changing lives through preaching the Gospel, feeding the hungry, sheltering the homeless, rehabilitating the addicted, and restoring the ex-offender. Our programs include: classes for teaching and preaching of the Gospel; an emergency shelter; the Urban Training Institute which has residential recovery/transition programs; nutritious meals served three times daily 365 days a year; weekly distribution of meals to inner City children; FIC (Families in Crisis) food and clothing distribution based on verification by clergy or agency referrals; and three Bargain Centers which are student-managed with all proceeds funding our service programs.
