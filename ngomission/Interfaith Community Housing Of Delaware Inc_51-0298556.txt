Founded in 1985, Interfaith Community Housing of Delaware (ICHDE) builds, rehabilitates, and owns or manages 380 housing units plus land in New Castle and Kent Counties. We are now the largest statewide nonprofit community housing organization in Delaware. In addition, through the HomeOwnership Education Center, our HUD-approved homeownership education and support programs for lower-income families, we provide tools to help our clients on the road to homeownership.
