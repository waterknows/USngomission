The Winston-Salem Rescue Mission is a non-denominational, Christ-centered ministry established as a response to hundreds of homeless men wandering the streets of Winston-Salem. Since 1967, the Rescue Mission has been actively involved in meeting the physical, spiritual, emotional, and social needs of destitute people. Through programs offered, the Mission is able to reach out and effectively care for over 100 men each day, enriching men's lives with nurturing and recovery services. Such services and programs provide clients with shelter, food, clothing, and personal-care items, along with job training, Christian counseling, work therapy, and life-skills and financial management classes.
