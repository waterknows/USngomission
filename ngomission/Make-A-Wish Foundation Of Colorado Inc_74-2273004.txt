The Make-A-Wish Foundation of Colorado grants the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions to enrich the human experience with hope, strength and joy. Since being founded in 1983, the chapter has granted more than 3,300 wishes to eligible Colorado children. The Foundation will consider the wish of any child diagnosed with a life-threatening medical condition who is between the ages of 2-1/2 and 18 and lives anywhere in the state of Colorado. The entire family is included in the child's magical wish. The wish is a time which provides joy, respite and family healing and is a time when the focus is not on the child's illness. The magic we provide by granting a wish gets the whole family out of the hospital and offers them a time of fun and togetherness.
