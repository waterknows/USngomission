The Empty Stocking Fund has been bringing holiday cheer to metro Atlanta's underprivileged children since 1927. The Empty Stocking Fund's mission is to empower parents and guardians of children living at or below the poverty level in the communities we serve by providing them with an opportunity to give their children gifts at Christmas time. Through relationships with wholesale distributors, the Empty Stocking Fund purchases brand new items in sufficient quantities to offer a variety of age- and gender-appropriate choices. In December, we invite parents and guardians of children from birth to 13 years of age to visit Santa's Village and select gifts for their children.
