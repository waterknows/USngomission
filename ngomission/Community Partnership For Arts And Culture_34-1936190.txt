Founded in 2000, Community Partnership for Arts and Culture (CPAC) seeks to strengthen, unify and connect greater Cleveland's arts and culture sector. Well-resourced, connected and unified arts and culture has the power to improve lives and communities. To that end, we serve and support arts and cultural professionals and community leaders who are creating a bright future for grater Cleveland. CPAC's research and advocacy fosters informed decision-making. Our training, counsel and online resources provide those we serve with the ideas, skills and connections to achieve their aims. By bringing people together, we ensure arts and culture is a continued force for community vitality and personal development.
