Founded in 2001 and located in the New York's Hudson Valley, Catskill Animal Sanctuary (CAS) is a 110-acre haven for horses and farm animals rescued from cruelty and neglect. In addition to direct animal aid, CAS offers a wide variety of programs and events (including on-site tours) designed to help people experience farm animals as the unique individuals they truly are, and to educate people about the institutionalized suffering of food animals on factory farms. Catskill Animal Sanctuary rescues farmed animals, ignites social change to end their exploitation, and champions vegan living.
