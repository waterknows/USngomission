The Global Fund for Children's (GFC) mission is to advance the dignity of children and youth around the world. GFC pursues its mission by making small grants to innovative community-based organizations working with some of the world's most vulnerable children and youth, complemented by a dynamic media program that, through books, documentary photography, and film, highlights the issues affecting children and celebrates the global society in which we all live. Since 1997, GFC has distributed more than $13.9 million in grants to more than 364 groups in 72 countries worldwide. In addition to providing opportunities for vulnerable children, our grantmaking model contributes to the growth of civil society, encourages the development of homegrown philanthropy, and supports social entrepreneurship.
