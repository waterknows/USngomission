Since its establishment in 1958, East Harlem Tutorial Program (EHTP) has been one of the most successful after-school educational programs in New York. Recognizing that each child has unique talents and learning styles, EHTP's After School Program relies on the interaction of parents, teachers and children in promoting literacy-based educational enrichment and personal development activities for enrollees between the ages of five and twenty-one. As a vital East Harlem education and enrichment center, EHTP works with children from early childhood through adulthood to ensure that they have the resources needed to access opportunities for academic, social and career advancement while fully engaging parents and caregivers in their children's development.
