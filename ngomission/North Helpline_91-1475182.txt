North Helpline was started in 1989 by a small group of volunteers who noticed that many of their neighbors were not able to pay their rent, cover their utility bills and put food on the table because their paychecks didn't stretch that far. These friends began collecting food and financial support to distribute to those most in need in their community. The initial group grew to 600+ volunteers who contribute over 2000 hours of work monthly. North Helpline now provides critical human services to over 1700 clients each week in an effort to reduce the impact of hunger and poverty in the Greater North Seattle Area.
