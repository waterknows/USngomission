For more than 50 years, the Academy of Achievement has sparked the imagination of students across America and around the globe by bringing them into direct personal contact with the greatest thinkers and achievers of the age. The annual International Achievement Summit has provided thousands of outstanding students with an unforgettable, life changing experience. Since 1961, these forums have allowed exceptional students to interact one-on-one with Nobel Prize-winners in the arts and sciences, world-renowned public servants, crusading journalists, intrepid explorers, revered humanitarians, world champion athletes, legendary figures of stage and screen, and countless others who represent the pinnacle of achievement in their respective fields.
