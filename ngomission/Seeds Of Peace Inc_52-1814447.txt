In the face of some of the world's most intractable conflicts, Seeds of Peace gives rise to new generations of leaders uniquely inspired and equipped to build lasting peace.Treaties are negotiated by governments; peace is made by people. Since 1993, Seeds of Peace has set the standard in international peace-building by providing exceptional young people and educators from regions of conflict with an otherwise impossible opportunity to meet their historic enemies face-to-face at our International Camp in Maine.We build on their extra-ordinary and critical relationships and understanding through year-round local programs that focus on the core leadership capacities needed to advance peace. There are now over 5,000 Seeds and Educators from 27 countries who prove that solutions exist, peace is possible, and there is reason to have hope for a better future.
