Our mission is to lead the community in efforts focused on relieving the suffering of, preventing cruelty to, and providing for humane treatment of animals.

We shall: provide temporary shelter and care for animals while seeking permanent homes; advocate for animals, speaking for those who cannot speak for themselves; intervene and prevent cruelty to animals; and educate the community regarding animal issues, responsible care and training, and the correlation between animal cruelty and human abuse.
