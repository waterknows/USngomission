Founded in 1985, Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) of Orange County serves children who, for their own protection, have been removed from their homes and placed in foster care. Judges refer the most serious cases of child abuse and neglect to CASA so that one volunteer can consistently spend time with one child, building a relationship and ensuring that each child is receiving the support and attention he or she needs and deserves while going through the foster care process. In addition, CASA volunteers independently monitor the child's circumstances and provide fact based information to the court in the best interest of a child, and advocate for a safe and permanent home for each child.
