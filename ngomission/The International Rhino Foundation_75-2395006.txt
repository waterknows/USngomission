Founded in 1989, the International Rhino Foundation (IRF) is dedicated to the survival of the world's rhino species through conservation and research.  For the last 19 years, IRF has funded and operated rhino conservation programs in Africa and Asia, focusing expertise and resources in areas where rhinos are most in need of protection, and where conservation efforts will have the most significant impact. Since its founding, IRF has also provided funding for scientific research that enhances the ability to manage rhinoceros populations both in the wild and in captivity. IRF also works with conservation centers and zoos to provide linkages between captive and wild populations of rhinos, with the ultimate objective of helping captive populations become a truly integral part of conservation strategies for rhinos. At the heart of IRF's vision is the belief that these magnificent species should endure for future generations, and that protecting rhinos ensures the survival of many other species that share their habitat, including people.
