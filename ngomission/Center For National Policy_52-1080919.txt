The Center for National Policy (CNP) directly engages Capitol Hill and the executive branch on the nation's most important national security issues. As an organization dedicated to fostering productive, insightful dialogue, CNP is uniquely able to bring together experts and policy makers from both sides of the political aisle for study, discussion, and action. Finding solutions to the complex national security issues facing our country requires building consensus and bipartisan cooperation, a vital role that CNP will continue to play through leveraging its comparative advantages and utilizing its knowledge of the policy making process.
