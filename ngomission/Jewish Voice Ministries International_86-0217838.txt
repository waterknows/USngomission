Jewish Voice Ministries International is dedicated to bringing the Gospel of Yeshua (Jesus) to the Jew first and also to the gentile throughout the world. The Good News is proclaimed through television, medical outreaches, seminars and large scale Messianic Outreach Festivals. We also partner with other ministries to establish and operate Messianic Jewish Bible Schools to train leadership for Jewish Ministry. This is followed up by planting new and strengthening existing congregations to nurture and disciple new believers.
