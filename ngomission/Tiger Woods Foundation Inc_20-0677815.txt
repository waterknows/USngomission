At the Tiger Woods Foundation, we believe in college access for underserved youth. Since its inception in 1996 by Tiger Woods and his father, Earl, the Tiger Woods Foundation has reached millions of young people by delivering unique experiences and innovative educational opportunities for youth worldwide. What began as simply a dream to provide young people with opportunities and the tools needed to achieve a bright future has grown into a global organization that has served young people around the world.
