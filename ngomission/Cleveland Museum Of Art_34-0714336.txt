Established in 1913, the Cleveland Museum of Art (CMA) works to fulfill its dual roles as one of the world's most distinguished comprehensive art museums and as one of northeastern Ohio's principal civic and cultural institutions. The museum seeks to bring the pleasure and meaning of art to the broadest possible audience in accordance with the highest aesthetic, intellectual and professional standards. Toward this end the museum augments, preserves, exhibits and fosters understanding of the outstanding collections of world art it holds in trust for the public and presents complementary exhibitions and programs. The CMA is currently undertaking an expansion and renovation project, schedule for completion in 2011. For much of this time, the Museum will remain open, although operating on reduced basis.
