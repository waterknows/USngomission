Mental Health America of Colorado, incorporated in 1953, began setting the stage for mental health leadership in our state. Since our founding that year, we have been changing community attitudes about mental health; replacing the one time hopelessness of a mental health diagnosis with hope, recovery and fulfilled lives. It is our dream that the stigma that is so often associated with mental health conditions will be eliminated, and it is our desire to provide Coloradans with current information about mental health conditions and their treatment. Our programs, built on the cornerstones of advocacy, education, prevention and outreach, make these aspirations a reality.
