Founded in 1978, The Mexico Area Family YMCA's mission is to put Christian principles into practice through programs that build healthy spirit, mind and body for all. It is a charitable community services organization that includes men, women and children of all ages, abilities, incomes, races and religions. We are dedicated to building strong kids, strong families, and strong communities by putting Christian principles into practice through programs that promote healthy lifestyles, strong values, leadership development, community interaction and international understanding.
