Founded in 1951, the Population Reference Bureau (PRB) informs people around the world about population, health, and the environment, and empowers them to use that information to advance the well-being of current and future generations. PRB focuses their work around these "core themes": Reproductive Health and Fertility; Children and Families; Global Health; Population and the Environment; Aging; Inequality and Poverty; Migration and Urbanization; and Gender. They also emphasize two Strategic Approaches: Building Coalitions and Mobilizing Civil Society.
