Founded in 1977, Studio in a School (STUDIO) fosters the creative and intellectual development of young people through quality visual arts programs directed by professional artists, and collaborates with and enhances the capacity of those who provide and support arts programming for youth. STUDIO's unique method brings professional artists into school and community organizations to lead classes in drawing, printmaking, painting, and sculpting, and work with teachers to link art with other academic subjects. While children gain the valuable experience of making art and learn how to verbalize their creative process, their participation in the arts extends to learning in other disciplines and promotes good oral, written, and problem-solving skills. STUDIO provides programs to more than 170 schools throughout the five boroughs annually.
