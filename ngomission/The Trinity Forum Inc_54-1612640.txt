The Trinity Forum is a nonprofit organization that works to cultivate networks of leaders whose integrity and vision will renew culture and promote human freedom and flourishing. We provide access to a broad but focused body of classic and thoughtful writings designed to facilitate conversation and reflection around some of society's most intriguing questions and themes. This is accomplished through unique programs and publications that offer contexts for leaders to consider together the great ideas that have shaped Western civilization and the faith that has animated its highest achievements.
