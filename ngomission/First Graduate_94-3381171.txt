First Graduate is a San Francisco-based college success program that helps students finish high school and become the first in their families to graduate from college. We make a 10-year commitment to each student, starting the summer after sixth grade through college graduation. Our students receive academic instruction, tutoring and support; high school and college counseling; mentoring; family engagement activities; career exploration activities; and access to college scholarships. We believe that a college degree is the best way to: break the cycle of poverty within families; build a productive, educated workforce; and build a productive, educated workforce.
