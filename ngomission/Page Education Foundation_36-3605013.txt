The Page Education Foundation was created in 1988 to increase participation of Minnesota's youth of color (African American, American Indian, Asian American and Chicano/Latino) in post-secondary education. We accomplish this in two ways: by fostering positive attitudes about education among school-age children of color and by offering financial assistance for post-secondary education. The Foundation has awarded grants to 2,667 students who have given more than 175,000 hours of their time to younger children.
