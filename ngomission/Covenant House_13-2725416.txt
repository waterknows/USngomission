Incorporated in 1972, Covenant House has been leading the effort to help homeless kids. And today, we are the largest privately-funded agency in the Americas that provides food, shelter, immediate crisis care, and an array of other important services to homeless, throwaway, and runaway kids. Covenant House is more than just a homeless shelter, we are also a leading advocate on behalf of street youth at local, state, national, and international levels of government. Last year, Covenant House Street Outreach Teams and Residential and Community Service Center Programs cared for over 70,000 at-risk and homeless kids in 20 cities in the United States, Canada, and Central America.
