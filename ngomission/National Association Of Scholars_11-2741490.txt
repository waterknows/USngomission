Founded in 1987, National Association of Scholars (NAS) is an independent membership association of academics working to foster intellectual freedom and to sustain the tradition of reasoned scholarship and civil debate in America's colleges and universities. The NAS today is higher education's most vigilant watchdog. We stand for intellectual integrity in the curriculum, in the classroom, and across the campus - and we respond when colleges and universities fall short of the mark. We uphold the principle of individual merit and oppose racial, gender, and other group preferences. And we regard the Western intellectual heritage as the indispensable foundation of American higher education.
