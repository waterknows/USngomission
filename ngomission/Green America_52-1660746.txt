Founded in 1982, Green America's mission is to harness economic power-- the strength of consumers, investors, businesses, and the marketplace-- to create a socially just and environmentally sustainable society. Our programs and campaigns fall into three main pillars: Green the World Campaigns (Safe Food, Clean Energy, Fair Labor, and Responsible Finance), Green Business (Green Business Network and Center for Sustainability Solutions), and Green Living (our educational print & online publications, guides, and business directory). We work for a world where all people have enough, where all communities are healthy and safe, and where the bounty of the Earth is preserved for all the generations to come.
