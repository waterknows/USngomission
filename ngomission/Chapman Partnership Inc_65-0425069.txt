Since 1995, Chapman Partnership, formerly Community Partnership for Homeless has been assisting homeless men, women and children in transitioning off the streets of Miami-Dade County and on their way to attaining greater stability and self-sufficiency in their lives. As the private sector partner of the Miami-Dade County Homeless Trust, we have continually been recognized as a national model for our comprehensive approach to helping the homeless. Our program's main catalyst for success - the Homeless Assistance Centers - operate as one-stop temporary care entry points that provide not just food and shelter, but comprehensive case management, health care, dental care, psychiatric care, day care, job development and training, job placement, permanent housing assistance and other help from a variety of social service agencies - all under one roof.
