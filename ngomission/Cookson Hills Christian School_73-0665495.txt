Since its beginning in 1957, Cookson Hills has offered help, hope, and healing to abused and neglected children and worked with their families to break the cycle of abuse, neglect, dependency, and failure. Set on more than 1,000 acres in the foothills of the Ozark Mountains in rural northeastern Oklahoma, Cookson Hills provides a rustic and rewarding retreat for children requiring out-of-home care. When families have exhausted the resources of their local church, school, and community and still face a crisis that threatens to overcome the families' ability to sustain itself, the most likely place to turn to is the government-run foster care or the juvenile justice system. Cookson Hills provides an alternative to those families by offering residential care for their child in a family-modeled environment, individualized Christian education, vocational training, spiritual formation programs and specialized therapeutic services.
