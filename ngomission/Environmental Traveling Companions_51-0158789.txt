Founded in 1972, Environmental Traveling Companions (ETC) believes that everyone, regardless of physical or financial limitations, should have the opportunity to experience the challenge and beauty of the wilderness. Through ETC's Sea Kayaking, River Rafting, Cross-Country Skiing and Youth Leadership School adventures, people with disabilities and other special needs overcome perceived limitations, attain greater personal freedom and confidence, and better understand themselves in relation to others and the environment. Every year over 2,000 people join us on outdoor adventures. These are people of all ages who have hearing impairments, physical, emotional or developmental disabilities or are living with a serious illness. We also provide outdoor education programs for school groups and economically disadvantaged youth.
