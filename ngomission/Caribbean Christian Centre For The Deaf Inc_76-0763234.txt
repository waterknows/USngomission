The Caribbean Christian Centre for the Deaf (CCCD) is a ministry that brings the gospel of Jesus Christ to the deaf of Jamaica. Through this ministry we will teach the deaf a language, provide a basic education, train in vocational areas, mentor and encourage the leaders and promote outreach, community, worship, and continuing education. CCCD operates three schools on the island of Jamaica. They are residential facilities that allows us to bring in the rural deaf that would otherwise not have access to the gospel of Jesus Christ or to a language, basic education or vocational training.
