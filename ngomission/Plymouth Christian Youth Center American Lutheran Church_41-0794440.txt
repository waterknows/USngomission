The mission of Plymouth Christian Youth Center (PCYC) is to enrich the skills, prospects, and spirit of North Minneapolis area youth in partnership with families and communities. The young people on whom we focus much of our work are those in the inner-city of Minneapolis who are facing significant barriers in life as they strive toward such full growth and active citizenship. We currently serve youth and families through three divisions: Education, Community Programs, and Community Development. Since its founding in the old hotel on Plymouth Avenue in 1954, PCYC has been there for kids. Today, more than 6,000 young people learn, grow and explore yearly, in the company of caring staff and volunteers.
