Founded in 1829, the Massachusetts Horticultural Society (MassHort) is dedicated to encouraging the science and practice of horticulture and developing the public's enjoyment, appreciation, and understanding of plants and the environment. In addition to its 8,000 members and headquarters at the 36-acre Elm Bank Horticulture Center, MassHort is known for its annual New England Spring Flower Show--the largest indoor event in New England and, after 136 years, the longest-running of its kind in the United States. MassHort's horticulture center offers adults and children the opportunity to experience, enjoy and learn about plants and the environment.
