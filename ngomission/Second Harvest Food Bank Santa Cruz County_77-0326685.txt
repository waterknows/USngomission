Founded in 1972, Second Harvest Food Bank of Santa Cruz and San Benito Counties educates and involves individuals to end hunger and alleviate malnutrition in our communities. Second Harvest began by distributing food from a parking lot in Santa Cruz to groups operating the Breakfast For Kids programs. Today, Second Harvest distributes 6.5 million pounds of food per year to local hungry families, children, individuals and seniors in our community through 180 agencies and programs. Our core values of compassion, service, involvement, empowerment, accountability, and advocacy govern our relationships with each other and with the community at large, ensuring that we stay true to our mission everyday.
