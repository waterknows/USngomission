Meals on Wheels and Senior Outreach Services has been enhancing the lives of Contra Costa County seniors since 1968. We serve a growing population of seniors (age 60 or older) in Contra Costa County. We offer six programs that work together to help keep our clients healthy, safe, and independent in their communities. These include: Meals on Wheels, CC Cafes, Friendly Visitors, the Home Care Registry, the Fall Prevention Program, and Geriatric Care Managers.
