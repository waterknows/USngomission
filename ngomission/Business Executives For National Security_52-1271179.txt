Business Executives for National Security (BENS), a nationwide, non-partisan organization, is the primary channel through which senior business executives can help enhance the nation's security. BENS members use their business experience to drive our agenda, deliver our message to decision makers, and make certain that the changes we propose are put into practice. BENS has only one special interest: to help make America safe and secure. BENS members have been using their business experience to find practical solutions to pressing national security challenges since 1982, when the organization was founded by business executive and entrepreneur Stanley A. Weiss.
