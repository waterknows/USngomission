For over 100 years, Girl Scouts of Minnesota and Wisconsin River Valleys, with the help of more than 18,000 dedicated adult volunteers, serves 45,000 girls in kindergarten through twelfth grade, in 49 counties across southern Minnesota and western Wisconsin, helping them build courage, confidence, and character to make our world a better place. The time honored activities of troop meetings, community service, badges, the cookie program and camping are some of the means by which Girl Scouting addresses the interests and needs of girls.
