Founded in 1922, United Way of Dane County unites and focuses the community to create measurable results in improving people's lives and strengthening our community. United Way of Dane County is achieving the goals our community identified as most critical, the Agenda for Change. Our goals are: students of color achieve at the same rate as white students; children are cared for and have fun as they become prepared for school; people who are uninsured have access to health care; there is a decrease in homelessness; seniors and people with disabilities are able to stay in their homes; there is a reduction in violence toward individuals and families; and non-profit agencies and volunteers are strong partners in achieving measurable results.
