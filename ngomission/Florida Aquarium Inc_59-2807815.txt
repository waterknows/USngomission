The Florida Aquarium astounds visitors with the beauty and fragility of our eco-system. The facility is home to more than 20,000 aquatic plants and animals from Florida and all over the world. The cornerstone of The Channel District, The Florida Aquarium's mission since opening in 1995 is to entertain, educate and inspire stewardship about our natural environment. It serves as a significant example of Florida's commitment to preserving native landscapes, ecosystems, historical and archaeological sites, and ethnic and cultural traditions representative of the diverse geography and cultural life unique to our state. The Aquarium has provided cultural enrichment experiences to more than seven million visitors, including 100,000 school students and 1,000 teachers annually.
