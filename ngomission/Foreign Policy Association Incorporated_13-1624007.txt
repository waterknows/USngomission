The Foreign Policy Association (FPA) was founded in 1918 as the League of Free Nations Association to support President Woodrow Wilson's efforts to achieve a just peace. FPA is dedicated to inspiring the American public to learn more about the world. FPA serves as a catalyst for developing awareness, understanding of and informed opinion on global issues. Through its balanced, nonpartisan programs and publications, FPA encourages citizens to participate in the foreign policy process.
