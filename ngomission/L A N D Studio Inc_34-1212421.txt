LAND studio, created from the successful merger of Cleveland Public Art and ParkWorks, works to identify, create and implement a public space vision for Cleveland. Our mission is to create places and connect people through public art, sustainable building and design, collaborative planning, and dynamic programming. We strive for balance in our portfolio by completing projects in the city's most visible public spaces as well as its disadvantaged communities. LAND is an acronym naming some of the tools we use to achieve our vision and reinforcing our commitment to being a collaborative participant in the building of a healthy city. We are dedicated to greening our LANDSCAPE, inspiring people with public ART, uniting NEIGHBORHOODS, and supporting sustainable building and DEVELOPMENT.
