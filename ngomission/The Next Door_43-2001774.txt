The Next Door will equip women in crisis to develop lives of wholeness and hope. The Next Door provides a continuum of evidence based services for women and their families impacted by addiction, mental illness, trauma and/or incarceration with Christ-centered compassionate care. We are a Christ-centered organization. We welcome all people. No one is forced to believe in Christ, but they will be cared for with Christ-centered principles.
