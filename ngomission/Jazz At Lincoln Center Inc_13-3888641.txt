Jazz at Lincoln Center's mission is to enrich the artistic substance and perpetuate the democratic spirit of America's music. From down home and elegant concert performances by the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra to entertaining educational programs that bring the sound and feeling of jazz into the lives of thousands of kids and grownups to innovative collaborative programs with artists in diverse idioms: we offer top quality musicianship and universal friendship. By taking the feeling of jazz on tour and by inviting artists and audiences from all over the world into our new home in New York City, Frederick P. Rose Hall, we bring people together for a simple purpose: to have a profoundly good time. Welcome is our motto.
