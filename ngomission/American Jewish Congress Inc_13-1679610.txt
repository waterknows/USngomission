The American Jewish Congress (AJ Congress) is an association of Jewish Americans organized to defend Jewish interests at home and abroad through public policy advocacy - using diplomacy, legislation, and the courts. Among our most important current projects are: advocacy for the safety and security of Israel, including upgrading Israel's role in NATO; leading the fight against terrorists' use of human shields and for interpretations of the Law of War allowing nations to protect themselves against terrorist attack; advocacy for religious freedom in the U.S., including the separation of church and state; energy independence from nations whose interests are opposed to our own; and furthering women's empowerment.
