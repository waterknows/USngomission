Riverfront Recapture was created in 1981 to develop a comprehensive plan to reunite Hartford with its Riverfront. Our goals are to restore access to the Connecticut River through the development of parks and public recreational facilities that improve the quality of life for people who live and work in Metro Hartford; to create an attractive destination for visitors, as well as residents; and to encourage economic development in Metro Hartford by leveraging public investment in the Riverfront Parks to attract private investment to neighboring property - creating jobs, generating additional tax revenues, and revitalizing the region.
