The Jewish Community Center of Eastern Fairfield County (JCC) and UJA-Federation are divisions of the Jewish Center for Community Services (JCCS). Serving the community since 1911, the JCC offers many programs and services to enrich your life, including education, social and cultural programs, recreation, health and fitness services, philanthropic opportunities and community activities for all ages. The Annual Campaign of the UJA-Federation is the central fund-raising program of our Jewish community. We fund programs in Jewish education (for children, teens and adults) social and medical support for the elderly, social services for the poor, jobless, sick, and threatened (locally and around the world), community programming at our JCC and elsewhere, and our active presence in the larger national and international community.
