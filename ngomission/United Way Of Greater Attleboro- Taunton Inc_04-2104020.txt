Founded in 1942, United Way of Greater Attleboro/Taunton's mission is to improve lives by uniting the caring power of communities to advance the common good. Our focus is on education, income, and health, because these are the building blocks for a good quality of life. We will recruit the people and organizations from all across the community who bring the passion, expertise, and resources needed to get things done. We invite you to be a part of the change. You can give, you can advocate, and you can volunteer. That's what it means to Live United.
