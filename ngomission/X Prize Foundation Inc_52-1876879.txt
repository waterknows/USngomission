Founded in 1995, the XPRIZE Foundation works to bring about radical breakthroughs for the benefit of humanity. We do this by creating and managing prizes that drive innovators to solve some of the greatest challenges facing the world today. The XPRIZE is viewed as the leading model to leverage the elements of public interest, entrepreneurial spirit and cross-disciplinary innovation to bring about breakthroughs that benefit us all. An XPRIZE is a $10 million+ award given to the first team to achieve a specific goal, set by the XPRIZE Foundation, which has the potential to benefit humanity. The XPRIZE Foundation continues to unveil new XPRIZEs in exploration (space and underwater), life sciences, energy and environment, education and global development.
