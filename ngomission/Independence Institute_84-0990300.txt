Founded in 1985, the Independence Institute empowers individuals and educates citizens, legislators and opinion makers about public policies that enhance personal and economic freedom. We provide research resulting in changes in law and policy. But we have never been content with just research. We are more than a think tank. We are an action tank. We put our ideas into action through groundbreaking litigation, activist training, work on ballot initiatives, new media and investigative reporting. We don't just fight on paper. We fight for freedom on the streets, in the statehouse, in the media, on the ballot, and in the courts.
