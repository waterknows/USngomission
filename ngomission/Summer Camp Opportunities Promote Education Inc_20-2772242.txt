Summer Camp Opportunities Promote Education (SCOPE), an independent, nonprofit organization, has provided camp scholarships for more than 20,000 children from low-income communities since 1991. Each year, hundreds of children receive the beneÔ¨Åts of summer camp through SCOPE from funds raised from foundation and corporate partners, individual gifts and fundraising events. SCOPE reinforces the connection between academic achievement and enriching recreational and educational benefits of summer camp, as children who return to camp each summer and graduate from high school are provided with scholarship funding to complete their college education.
