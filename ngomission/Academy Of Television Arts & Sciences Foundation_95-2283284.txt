Established as the charitable arm of the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences in 1959, the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Foundation utilizes the resources and membership of the Television Academy to develop and sponsor educational and archival programs. The Foundation addresses a variety of issues, such as career guidance and student achievement. Our programs foster personal skill development, address diversity and document the evolution of television and digital media. Our primary focus is to use the history and artistry of television to preserve our past for posterity, and guide those who will be our future. The Archive of American Television strives to preserve the rich history of television. The Education Programs Department extends informational opportunities to our members, the telecommunications community and community at large.
