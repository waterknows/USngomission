California Master Masons founded the Masonic Homes of California over 100 years ago to provide organized relief to those in need. Today, in residential and community-based programs, the Masonic Homes cares for seniors and children in the name of every Mason in California- past, present and future. The Masonic Homes of California are a unifying symbol of the fraternal commitment to provide relief for the betterment of our members in need and society in general. Working in collaboration with individual Masons and Lodges, we eliminate those conditions in life that prevent people from achieving their full potential, enjoying satisfying relationships with family and friends and contributing to their communities.
