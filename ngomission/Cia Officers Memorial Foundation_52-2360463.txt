Since its founding in 1947, the men and women of the Central Intelligence Agency have served America in peace and war around the world to confront those who would do harm to our country and to alert the President and our national leaders to dangers and opportunities abroad. The Foundation was established in December 2001 to provide educational support to the children of CIA officers killed in the line of duty. In May 2006, the Foundation's Board of Directors voted to expand its mission to include providing educational support to the spouses of CIA officers killed in the line of duty, and the children and spouses of officers who die on active duty as a result of accident, illness or other causes.
