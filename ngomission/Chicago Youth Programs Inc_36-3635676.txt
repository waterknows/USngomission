Founded in 1984, Chicago Youth Programs (CYP) serves inner-city youth who do not have access to social services due to location, poverty, or availability. CYP strives to improve the health and life opportunities of at-risk youth through a comprehensive, long-term approach aimed at developing their capabilities. Recognizing that there are many obstacles to inner-city children's social, cognitive, emotional, and physical growth, CYP provides consistent programming in the areas of: Education, Mentoring, Recreation, Leadership Development, Preventative Health Care, College Prep, Scholarship Support and Career Assistance. All of their programs are free and CYP provides free transportation to and from programming to ensure access.
