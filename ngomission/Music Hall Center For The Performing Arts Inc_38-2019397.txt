Since 1928, Music Hall Center for the Performing Arts' intimate downtown venue has been a significant player in Detroit's performing arts sector. As the last remaining legitimate stage theatre, Music Hall is the only Detroit venue built for the primary purpose of presenting live performances. We have been home to the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, Michigan Opera Theatre, one of the nation's first Cinerama screens, and a wide variety of quality performances that embody the diverse cultures of the world. As a prominent variety house, Music Hall provides accessible music, theatre, dance, and other performance programming and education to a diverse audience. An opportunity for rising stars and a home for classic icons, Music Hall is truly a cultural resource for the city of Detroit.
