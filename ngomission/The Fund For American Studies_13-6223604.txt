The Fund for American Studies (TFAS) seeks to create a brighter, more prosperous future by preparing young people for leadership, teaching them the ideas of freedom and a free-market economy. Our approach is to recruit young people likely to pursue careers in public policy, journalism, international affairs, business, government and related fields, and to educate them in the ideas most conducive to human achievement - individual liberty and personal responsibility. Founded in 1967, TFAS organizes programs in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Latin America.
