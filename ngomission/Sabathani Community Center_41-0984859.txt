Sabathani Community Center was founded in 1966 and is now a multi-service organization serving a diverse community in four program areas: Building strong, healthy families, creating school success for children and teens, keeping seniors active and healthy, and community-based health resources. It has created a focal point for community identity, empowerment and social change. Sabathani serves as a place where residents can gather in a welcoming environment, fellowship, build community, conduct business and receive programs and services that would move people forward.
