The Jewish Community Federation of Richmond is the central fundraising, community planning, leadership development, and outreach arm of the Jewish Community. Since 1935, the Jewish Community Federation of Richmond has served as the central address of the organized Jewish community in Richmond. A voluntary association of social service agencies, organizations and synagogues, the Federation works to ensure the well-being, continuity and strength of Richmond's vibrant Jewish community. The Federation is guided by professional and lay leaders who are grounded in the traditional Jewish values of Tzedakah, deeds of loving kindness, justice and Tikkun Olam, which call upon us to rescue the imperiled, care for the vulnerable and help assure the vitality of Jewish life in Richmond, in Israel and around the world.
