1 in 3 pregnancies in Florida end in abortion, ending the life of an unborn child and changing the life of the mother forever. First Care exists to intervene in a woman's search for an abortion to provide her with the help, support, and truth she needs to choose life for her unborn baby and know the love of Christ. The 80% Rule: According to national statistics, if a woman considering abortion goes to an abortion clinic first, 80% of the time she chooses abortion. But if she receives an ultrasound at a life-affirming pregnancy clinic first, 80% of the time she chooses life. Where she goes first can be the difference between life and death. First Care recognizes the struggle and fear surrounding an unplanned pregnancy and empowers each woman with the truth, compassion, medical care, and support she needs to choose life for her unborn baby.
