Conservation Colorado Education Fund's (CCEF) mission is to educate and mobilize people to protect Colorado's environment and quality of life. CCEF is a grassroots, statewide organization working to protect Colorado's air, land, water, and people. CCEF works in four core program areas-Energy & Climate Change, Wilderness & Public Lands, Water, and Civic Engagement. In each of these areas, we focus on investment in organizing and outreach based around shared core values that can fundamentally change policy outcomes to advance conservation in our democratic society.
