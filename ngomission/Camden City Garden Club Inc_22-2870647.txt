The Camden City Garden Club inspires and educates people of all ages by providing opportunities to improve their quality of life, health and community through horticulture. Originally formed in 1985 for the purpose of assisting Camden City residents with community gardening, the Club's programs soon expanded in 1989 to include the in-school Grow Lab Program and the Youth-at-Risk Job Training and Employment Program. The organization's community gardening program has been expanded to include community greening and beautification projects as well as urban farming. The Club opened the Camden Children's Garden in 1999 as a special place for families and children to explore and discover the natural world.
