Founded in 1982, Marian House is a holistic, healing community for women and their families who are in need of housing and support services. We provide a safe, loving environment that challenges women to respect and love themselves, confront emotional and socio-economic barriers, and build stable and productive lives. Marian House strives to transform our society by unlocking the potential found within the women we serve. A transitional and supportive housing program, Marian House is located in the Better Waverly neighborhood of Baltimore City. We serve homeless women who have suffered through poverty, addiction, abuse, mental illness or incarceration.
