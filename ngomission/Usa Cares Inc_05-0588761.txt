USA Cares provides financial and advocacy assistance to post 9/11 active duty US military service personnel, veterans and their families. We assist all branches of service, all ranks and components and treat all with privacy and dignity in appreciation for their service and sacrifice. We never charge fees nor accept repayment and rely on donations from private citizens, businesses and foundations for all funding. Our goal is to help restore financial stability and self-sufficiency by giving 'a hand up not a hand out.' We strive to reach families at the earliest stage of intervention to prevent further financial distress and suffering, especially for the combat injured and their families.
