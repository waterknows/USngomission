The Land Stewardship Project (LSP) was founded in 1982 to foster an ethic of stewardship for farmland, to promote sustainable agriculture, and to develop sustainable communities. Made up of farmers as well as rural and urban residents, LSP works together to: secure a healthful food supply; preserve soil, water, and wildlife; support diversified, profitable family-sized farms; organize communities for positive change; hold corporations and governments accountable; and create a new sustainable vision for our food and agriculture system. Our work is concentrated in four areas: community based food and economic development, Farm Beginnings, policy and organizing, and stewardship science.
