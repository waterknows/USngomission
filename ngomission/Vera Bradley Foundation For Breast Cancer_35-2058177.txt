Founded in 1998, the Vera Bradley Foundation for Breast Cancer is committed to funding breast cancer research. The mission of the foundation is to eradicate Breast Cancer as a life-threatening disease by funding research and research related projects. Currently, we fund research at the Vera Bradley Foundation for Breast Cancer Research Laboratories at the Indiana University School of Medicine in Indianapolis, Indiana. Knowing that cancer will not be cured in a vacuum, members of our team are well known worldwide for their collaborative approach. It's this sharing of information, talents and resources that will accelerate the pace of research.
