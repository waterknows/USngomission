Frederik Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Foundation (formerly Michigan Botanic Garden Foundation) was established in 1993 as a single-purpose foundation with the goal of creating an endowment fund to support the Frederik Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Park. The Frederik Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Park promotes the enjoyment, understanding and appreciation of the gardens, sculpture, the natural environment and the arts. Comprised of 125 acres of natural wetlands, woodlands, meadows and botanical gardens, Frederik Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Park is a year round experience.
