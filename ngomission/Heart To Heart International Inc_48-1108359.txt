Heart to Heart International is improving global health through humanitarian initiatives that connect people and resources to a world in need. We have a global mission to create a healthier world. Every year, we make a positive impact in the lives of millions of people in more than 60 countries, including the United States. We develop humanitarian programs that promote health and wellness. We deliver results in these programs using two key strategies - the energy of volunteers and equity of strategic partners. We help volunteers and partners alike make a quality humanitarian connection to a world in need.
