SafeHouse Outreach is an urban outreach committed to affecting real change in the lives of those in the margins of society, by providing a hand up, not just a hand out. SafeHouse provides practical, emotional, and physical assistance to those living in the margins, and help integrate them back into society - to lead healthy, functional lives. Our programs are designed to meet individual needs, while instilling the principles of personal responsibility and accountability - with unconditional acceptance.
