The Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center (ADARC) was established in 1991 to focus on the basic science of AIDS and HIV in a research environment that fosters the highest scientific creativity. ADARC is the world's largest independent research center devoted solely to HIV/AIDS Research. We are fully committed to our mission to find solutions that will ultimately end the AIDS pandemic. We have adopted a multidisciplinary approach - virology, immunology, molecular biology, and clinical medicine - to pursue a number of projects in AIDS research. In addition to basic research, ADARC also runs a Clinical Program that translates research into Clinical Trials that can affect millions of people living with HIV.
