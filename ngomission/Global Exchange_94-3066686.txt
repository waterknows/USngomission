Global Exchange envisions a people centered globalization that values the rights of workers and the health of the planet; that prioritizes international collaboration as central to ensuring peace; and that aims to create a local, green economy designed to embrace the diversity of our communities. As an education and action resource center, we advance our vision by working to ensure our members and constituents are empowered locally and connected globally to create a just and sustainable world. Global Exchange is tackling some of the most critical issues of our time: from the War in Iraq to oil consumption and global climate change, from the exploitation of the global economy to the creation of the local green economy.
