Founded in 1986, Samaritan Ministry of Greater Washington is a community partnership bringing together homeless people and others in need in Greater Washington with support and volunteers from Episcopal churches and other churches in a joint effort to improve the lives of all. Samaritan Ministry pursues this goal by: promoting awareness of community needs, fostering partnerships at all levels, breaking down barriers imposed by poverty, and developing participant's abilities to help themselves to better lives. Every month, Samaritan Ministry helps over 300 homeless or otherwise disadvantaged people to improve their lives, most of them on an ongoing basis.
