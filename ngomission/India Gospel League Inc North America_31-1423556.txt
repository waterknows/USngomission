India Gospel League (IGL)'s goal is to facilitate heart change by bringing the very best of the gospel of Jesus Christ to rural Indian culture. Through our holistic ministry, we share the good news of Christ, people respond and indigenous pastors move from village to village with the complete package of the life-changing Word of God.

Our work focuses on evangelism and church planting, children's ministries, medical outreach, and rural and economic development.
