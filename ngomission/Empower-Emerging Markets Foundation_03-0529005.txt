EMpower, The Emerging Markets Foundation, connects the resources of Emerging Markets (EM) professionals worldwide with the vitality of local organizations in emerging market countries. Founded in 2000 by financial professionals from the EM community who wanted to give back to the countries where they did business, EMpower makes grants to local organizations working to improve conditions in their communities. EMpower UK was formed in 2007 when a group of London-based EM professionals wanted to add their resources and energy to the work being done by EMpower US. Recently, EMpower has incorporated in Hong Kong and is in the process of forming an Underwriting Group and a Board. Beginning in 2005, EMpower narrowed its focus to strategically invest in at-risk youth, aged 10-24. We provide funding and other critical support to organizations in EM countries that are working to improve the lives of young people.
