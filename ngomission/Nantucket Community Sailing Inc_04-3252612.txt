Founded in 1994, the mission of Nantucket Community Sailing (NCS) is to engage people of all ages in the joy of sailing, offering access to all Nantucket's youth, and teaching every participant in our programs enduring life and leadership skills, with a deep respect for the marine environment. NCS is an educational non-profit that provides affordable access to sailing and water sports to the public.
