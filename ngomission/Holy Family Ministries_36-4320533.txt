Holy Family Ministries provides opportunities for children and adults from Chicago's underserved neighborhoods to excel academically, grow spiritually, expand life experiences and become effective leaders. In partnership with Chicago's low-income communities, we provide safe havens where children and adults learn, grow spiritually, find hope, and broaden life skills.
