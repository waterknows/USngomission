USAction, founded in 1999, builds power by uniting people locally and nationally, on-the-ground and online, to win a more just and progressive America. We organize for power because unequal distribution of power allows the privileged few to pursue their own ends at the expense of the dignity and well-being of the many. We organize for power to guarantee all Americans the self-evident rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
