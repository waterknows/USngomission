Founded in 1992, Youth for Christ (YFC) is a worldwide Christian movement working with young people around the globe. Motivated by their faith in Jesus Christ they share the good news of God with young people. Youth for Christ is made up of tens of thousands of primarily volunteer indigenous people in over 100 nations working together in giving every young person an opportunity to be a follower of Jesus Christ and become a part of a local church. YFC is committed to take the Gospel of Jesus Christ to all young people and always seek to do so with urgency, using the most culturally acceptable means.
