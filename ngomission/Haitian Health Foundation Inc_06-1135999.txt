The mission of the Haitian Health Foundation is to improve the health and well being of the poor, sick, and the infirm of the greater Jérémie area, with a focus on women and children. This is accomplished through: a secondary care outpatient clinic; a public health outreach program; nutritional rehabilitation services; safe motherhood services; community development programs; self-help programs which advance family & community self-sufficiency; responding to emergencies and crises with humanitarian relief; and programs to facilitate the exchange of knowledge and expertise between Haitians and the international community.
