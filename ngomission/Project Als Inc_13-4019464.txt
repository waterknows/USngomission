Jenifer Estess, her family, and friends, started Project ALS in 1998, when Jenifer was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Upon discovering that there were no effective treatments, Project ALS set out to put medicine into place. The mission today is to bring the best science to ALS patients in the form of effective treatments and, ultimately, a cure. Project ALS has raised over $70 million, currently directing 87% to research programs. The majority of fundraising proceeds goes to support investigations in genetics, drug discovery, stem cells, and disease pathways. The hallmark of Project ALS research is collaboration. Researchers who were competitors now play on the same team, meet regularly, share data openly, and work rationally, constructively, and aggressively toward shared goals.
