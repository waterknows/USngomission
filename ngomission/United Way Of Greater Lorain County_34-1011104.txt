Everyone deserves opportunities to have a good life: a quality education that leads to a stable job, enough income to support a family through retirement, and good health. That's why the United Way of Greater Lorain County's work is focused on the building blocks for a good life:

Education - Helping Children and Youth Achieve Their Potential

Income - Promoting Financial Stability and Independence

Health - Improving People's Health

United Way's goal is to create long-lasting changes by addressing the underlying causes of these problems.
