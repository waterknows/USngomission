Founded in 1982, the Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies is a group of conservatives and libertarians dedicated to reforming the current legal order. We are committed to the principles that the state exists to preserve freedom, that the separation of governmental powers is central to our Constitution, and that it is emphatically the province and duty of the judiciary to say what the law is, not what it should be. We seek to promote awareness of these principles and to further their application through our activities. Overall, the Society's efforts are improving our present and future leaders' understanding of the principles underlying American law.
