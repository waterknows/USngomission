Utah Food Bank Fights Hunger Statewide. For over 100 years, the Utah Food Bank has stayed true to its mission of serving those in need throughout our state. We work tirelessly with community partners and volunteers to continue making an impact. Utah Food Bank staff, volunteers and agencies work together to gather and distribute emergency food to individuals and families experiencing the pain of hunger in Utah. The organization started in 1904 and, since 1977, Utah Food Bank has been the central hub for food collection and distribution in Utah. Our resources include a large warehouse, four semi-tractors, and eight box trucks, as well as our valuable affiliation with Feeding America. With these resources, Utah Food Bank is able to collect, store and distribute large quantities of food for the entire state of Utah.
