WheatonArts and Cultural Center engages artists and audiences in an evolving exploration of creativity. We are a leading resource of American craft with an emphasis on the medium of glass, a stronghold in New Jersey's cultural history. Programs include museum and gallery exhibits; interpretive demonstrations in various craft mediums; an artist fellowship program; outreach and on-site school programs; and collector's seminars. All serve to educate a multi-level audience on the role of the crafts in both traditional and contemporary life.
