Children's Leukemia Foundation of Michigan (CLF) provides and promotes compassionate, personalized support to adults and children in Michigan affected by leukemia, lymphoma and other related blood disorders. One of CLF's primary goals is to empower patients and caregivers with the knowledge they need to make informed decisions to better cope with leukemia and related disorders. With the tools we provide, patients and families can tap into the information they need, as well as pose questions and share their experiences with others who are battling these diseases.
