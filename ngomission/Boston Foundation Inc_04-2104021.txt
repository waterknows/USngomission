Established in 1915, The Boston Foundation devotes its resources to building and sustaining a vital, prosperous city and region, where justice and opportunity are extended to everyone. We fulfill this mission in three principal ways: making grants to nonprofit organizations and designing special funding initiatives to address this community's critical challenges; working in partnership with donors and other funders to achieve high-impact philanthropy; serving as a civic hub and center of information, where ideas are shared, levers for change are identified, and common agendas for the future are developed. The Foundation and its donors make more than $80 million in grants every year.
