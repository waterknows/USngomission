House of Hope has been providing basic human needs for struggling people in Martin County, Florida, since 1984. Core service programs are provided at four locations -- Stuart, Hobe Sound, Indiantown and Jensen Beach. House of Hope has nested all its services within Project HOPE (Helping Others Progress through Empowerment), ensuring that all people seeking help receive some level of case management. This helps to examine the root causes of their needs and opens a dialogue about further channels of assistance. Collectively, the services provided through Project HOPE are designed to empower people in need and afford them the greatest opportunity for health, financial stability and life success.
