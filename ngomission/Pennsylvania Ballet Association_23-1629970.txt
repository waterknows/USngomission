Since its inception in 1963, Pennsylvania Ballet has been at the forefront of dance in America and is widely regarded as one of the premier ballet companies in the nation. The School and Company were established by Barbara Weisberger, a Balanchine protégé, through a Ford Foundation initiative to develop regional professional dance companies. Drawing its audiences from throughout the tri-state region, Pennsylvania Ballet presents a season of six productions in Philadelphia, including the holiday spectacular, George Balanchine's The Nutcracker, balancing classic ballets with new works that challenge the dancers and attract a diverse audience. The Company also tours throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, as well as in other locations in the Northeastern U.S.
