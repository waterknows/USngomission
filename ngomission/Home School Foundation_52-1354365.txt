Home School Foundation's mission is to bless homeschoolers and the cause of homeschooling. The Home School Foundation is the charitable arm of Home School Legal Defense Association. It was founded by HSLDA in 1994 with the original focus of helping other homeschool groups. God has since expanded our vision, however, to include needy families within the homeschool community. These two organizations are very closely tied in their mission to help and support the homeschool community.
