Strategies for the Global Environment is the umbrella organization for the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES), an independent, nonpartisan, nonprofit organization working to advance strong policy and action to address the twin challenges of energy and climate change. Launched in November 2011, C2ES is the successor to the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, long recognized in the United States and abroad as an influential and pragmatic voice on climate issues. The Pew Center's founder, Eileen Claussen, and its senior team continue to lead the effort.
