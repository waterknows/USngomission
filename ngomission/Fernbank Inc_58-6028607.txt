Fernbank Museum of Natural History inspires life-long learning of natural history through dynamic programming to encourage a greater appreciation of our planet and its people. Fernbank Museum opened to the public in 1992, becoming one of the only museums in the world to grow out of an old-growth forest. Since then, the Museum has continued to grow and expand its collection. In 2001 Fernbank became the first museum in the world to display the world's largest dinosaur, Argentinosaurus. In 2004, Fernbank was selected as the new permanent home of The St. Catherines Island Foundation and Edward John Noble Foundation Collection, which contains more than one million objects spanning a period of over 5,000 years.
