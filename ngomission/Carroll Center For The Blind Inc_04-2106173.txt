The Carroll Center for the Blind serves the needs of blind and visually-impaired persons by providing rehabilitation, skills training, and educational opportunities to achieve independence, self-sufficiency, and self-fulfillment and by educating the public regarding the potential of persons who are blind and visually-impaired. Established in 1936, the Center has pioneered innovative methods for blind persons to gain independence in their homes, in class settings, and in their work places. New and evolving technologies, combined with time-tested adaptive methods, individualized instruction, and personalized therapies developed by the Carroll Center staff, have provided thousands of blind and vision impaired persons with diverse opportunities for success and independent living.
