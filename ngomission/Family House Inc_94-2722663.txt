Founded in 1981, Family House provides temporary housing to families of seriously ill children receiving treatment at the University of California San Francisco Children's Hospital. Qualifying families live more than 50 miles from UCSF, and many live at or below the low-income status as determined by UCSF. Our two locations sustain nearly a 100% occupancy rate and can accommodate 107 people per night. Over the course of a year we serve more than 2,000 families. At Family House, we work tirelessly to provide families with children undergoing treatment at UCSF Children's Hospital a place they can feel at home - a place of comfort, community, and courage.
