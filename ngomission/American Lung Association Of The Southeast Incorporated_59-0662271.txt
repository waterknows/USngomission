Founded in 1916 to fight tuberculosis, the American Lung Association of the Southeast, Inc. serves Florida, Georgia and South Carolina. It is the primary organization that is working to improve lung health and prevent lung disease. Lung disease death rates continue to increase while other leading causes of death have declined. The American Lung Association of the Southeast funds vital research on lung disease, including lung cancer, in order to find better treatment and cures. The Lung Association provides education and support programs to both adults and children and advocates for stronger air laws and tobacco prevention and education at the capital.
