Interfaith Youth Core seeks to make Interfaith Cooperation a social norm. We believe that American college students, supported by their campuses, can be the interfaith leaders needed to make religion a bridge and not a barrier. Our interfaith leaders are building a movement of people from all faiths and traditions who are working together to change the world.
