INSIGHT works to inspire confidence, build skills, and empower people who are blind and visually impaired to become full integrated, equally valued members of society by providing diverse services that produce opportunities and choices. Vision rehabilitation is the key piece of INSIGHT's mission of inspiring confidence, building skills, and empowering people who are blind and visually impaired. Our team of trained professionals work with people to identify their needs, interests, and goals and then establish an action plan that may include a low vision assessment, rehabilitation training classes, or computer classes. INSIGHT Radio is a unique, closed-circuit radio reading service that keeps people who are print disabled informed and entertained throughout the day.
