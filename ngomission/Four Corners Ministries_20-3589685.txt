Founded in 2003, Four Corners Ministries (FCM) exists to spread the Gospel of Christ by demonstrating unconditional love and by building relationships to serve orphans and families in Africa. FCM is focused on building relationships with vulnerable children and families in Africa. Each year, FCM facilitates mission trips to Uganda and South Sudan, giving Christians in North America the opportunity to demonstrate the love of Christ to some of the most forgotten people in the world.
