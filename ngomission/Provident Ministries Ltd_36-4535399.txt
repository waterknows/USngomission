At Provident Ministries we have experienced the provision of God for purposeful living, and His direction for our future. Our hope and prayer is that you will also experience His presence. Provident Ministries consists of several ministries. The Mission of Feeding The Nations is to deliver food, vitamins, planting seed, Bibles and medicine, and other necessities to families who lack these essentials due to famine, war, poverty, or other natural disasters. Sumrall Ministries International is dedicated to bringing direction and guidance to this generation. Provident Network is a fellowship and covering for workers in God's ministry here on earth. Provident Ministries also includes Christ Chapel Church, which worships together with joy, in the unity of the hope of Christ, and the strength of the Holy Spirit.
