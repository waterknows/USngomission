Helen Keller Services for the Blind (HKSB), founded in 1893 as the Industrial Home for the Blind. Over the years program and facility changes have been made, as needed, to reflect the needs of a diverse population of persons who were living in the New York City Metropolitan Area. The ability of this agency to respond to changing needs over the past 100 years has sustained its viability as an important resource. HKSB is well prepared and positioned to move into its second century maintaining a commitment to the mission of enabling people of all ages who are visually impaired, blind or deaf-blind to lead as independent a life as possible within their own communities.
