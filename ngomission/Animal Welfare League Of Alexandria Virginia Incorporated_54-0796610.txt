The mission of Animal Welfare League of Alexandria is to inspire compassion for all living things, to provide shelter to animals in need, and to promote adoptions, animal welfare, and responsible pet ownership in our community. The League is an animal sheltering and welfare organization focused on community responsiveness, professional animal care, dynamic education, compatible adoptions and a philosophy of compassion in all we do. We offer animal adoptions, citizen's assistance, a reduced cost spay/neuter program, animal control, help for wildlife, city animal licensing, pet bereavement services, and a reduced cost rabies clinic.
