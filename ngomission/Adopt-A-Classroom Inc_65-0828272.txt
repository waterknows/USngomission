AdoptAClassroom.org gives teachers a hand by providing needed classroom materials so that students can succeed.It is estimated that more than 15 million children don't have the resources they need to succeed in school and that teachers spend more than $1 billion a year stocking their own classrooms due to a lack of funding in schools. Supporting K-12th grade students, including public, private, and charter school classrooms, AdoptAClassroom.org makes it easy for donors to provide funding and support to classrooms throughout America. Teachers register their classrooms and needs online; donors discover classrooms through simple search tools, and make targeted contributions. As an award-winning 501(c)(3) non-profit, we are able to connect donors with every classroom in the country.
