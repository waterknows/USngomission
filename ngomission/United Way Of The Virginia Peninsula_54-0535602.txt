United Way of the Virginia Peninsula works year-round in collaboration with other stakeholders in our community municipalities, faith-based groups, other funders, and health and human service organizations to help identify our area's most critical needs. Ensuring the adequate funding of effective human service programs in our community is one way United Way helps solve critical issues. Another large part of United Way's work is the way we involve all sectors of the community in our fund distribution decision-making. Our staff, along with volunteers your friends and neighbors thoroughly research agency programs, study program goals and make visits to agencies to see programs in action. Then together they make recommendations. United Way believes it's important for the people living in the community to make the decisions that affect the community.
