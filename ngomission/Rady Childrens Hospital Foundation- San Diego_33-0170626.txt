Rady Children's Hospital Foundation was founded in 1985 with the goal of consolidating, coordinating and enhancing the fundraising efforts of Rady Children's Hospital-San Diego. The Foundation is also responsible for increasing community awareness of Rady Children's through various media and for promoting the hospital's strategic priorities. Our mission is to be responsible for developing, accepting and recognizing philanthropy in support of Rady Children's Hospital-San Diego and its subsidiary corporations. Rady Children's is San Diego region's only designated pediatric trauma center and the only area hospital dedicated solely to pediatric care. Our goal is to help create a region where all children go to school healthy and ready to learn how to be productive, responsible citizens.
