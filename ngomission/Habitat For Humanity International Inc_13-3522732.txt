Habitat for Humanity of Westchester is an affiliate of Habitat for Humanity International, founded in 1976 by Millard and Linda Fuller and headquartered in Americus, Georgia. The Westchester affiliate was established in 1988. The concept of the organization is simple. Christians share an abundance, making available a portion of their resources for construction of modest, well-built homes for the poor. Building costs are kept to a minimum through volunteer labor, including that of the prospective owner, gifts of land, and donations from contractors, tradesmen, corporations and individuals.
