Although founded 36 years before the birth of the nation, Bethesda Home for Boys is more focused on the future than the past. Bethesda provides educational, residential, and guidance programs to disadvantaged boys who have been placed in the home for various reasons. Today, we have 120 boys attending school at Bethesda with 40 residing on campus. It's their futures we're the most concerned about. It's what continues to make Bethesda, as founder George Whitefield envisioned, a house of mercy to boys in need.
