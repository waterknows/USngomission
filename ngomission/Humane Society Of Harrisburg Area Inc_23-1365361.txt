The Humane Society of Harrisburg Area (HSHA) works to build a better community for pets and people through compassion, protection, education, and collaboration. HSHA has been serving the community since 1911. HSHA accomplishes this mission through a wide variety of programs and services for both pets and people. The organization's service area encompasses Dauphin, Cumberland, Perry, and Northern York Counties. HSHA accepts homeless animals regardless of their breed, age, medical condition, or behavioral condition and takes in thousands of homeless animals each year. However, HSHA does not euthanize adoptable animals due to lack of space or length of stay.
