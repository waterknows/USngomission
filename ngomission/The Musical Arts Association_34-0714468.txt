Founded in 1918, The Cleveland Orchestra has become one of the most sought-after performing ensembles in the world. In concerts at its winter home at Severance Hall and at each summer's Blossom Festival, in residencies from Miami to Vienna, and on tour around the world, The Cleveland Orchestra sets standards of artistic excellence, creative programming, and community engagement. The Cleveland Orchestra's commitment to education and community service began when the Orchestra was founded, and has remained a top priority ever since. Today, more than 70,000 area schoolchildren, teachers, families, young musicians and adult learners participate in the Orchestra's educational programs at Severance Hall and in schools, libraries and community locations throughout the region - all designed to nurture a lifelong love of music.
