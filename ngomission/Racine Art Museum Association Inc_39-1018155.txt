The Racine Art Museum (RAM) is an outgrowth of the 73-year old Charles A. Wustum Museum of Fine Arts (Wustum). RAM operates both locations, using Wustum as its visual education center while RAM (open since 2003) is home to internationally recognized exhibitions of contemporary crafts. RAM's mission is dedicated to the exhibition, collection, preservation, and education in contemporary visual arts. RAM houses the largest collection of contemporary crafts in the United States. With a permanent collection of more than 8,000 objects, half of these pieces represent the museum's focus on works from internationally recognized artists in ceramics, fibers, glass, metals, wood, and polymer. Wustum hosts exhibitions of regional/local artists and has one of the largest museum-based studio art class programs in the State. RAM's expanding outreach programs provide free or low-cost, hands-on art experiences to people of all ages at both museums and in other community settings.
