Physicians for Peace was founded in 1989, dedicated to the ideal that health care in the developing world can best be improved by providing training and education to health care professionals in those countries. By focusing on long-term, sustainable, replicable medical education and training, we send teams of medical volunteers - including physicians, dentists, nurses, physical therapists, physician assistants and other healthcare professionals - to places where their teaching and healing skills are needed most. We have developed a number of specific, sustainable programs, each in response to a particular need voiced by the nations that we visit. Each of these core programs follows specific methodologies, and can be replicated in other nations facing similar health-care needs.
