The Steadman Philippon Research Institute is dedicated to keeping people of all ages physically active through orthopaedic research and education in the areas of arthritis, healing, rehabilitation, and injury prevention. We are committed to researching the causes, prevention and treatment of orthopaedic disorders. Founded in 1988, we continue to pursue our goals of: understanding and enlisting the body's innate ability to heal; designing and validating surgical and rehabilitation techniques, as well as non-operative treatments for arthritis; and producing and publishing scientifically validated research in leading medical and scientific journals.
