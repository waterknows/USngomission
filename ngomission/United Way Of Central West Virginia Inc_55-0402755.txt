United Way of Central West Virginia's mission is to improve lives by mobilizing the caring power of our community. United Way of Central Virginia brings people and resources together to create positive change and lasting impact for our community. Our partners include twenty-six human service agencies that administer thirty two programs focused on the issues of education, health and financial stability. United Way works with its partner agencies and other organizations to create collective solutions to our community's most critical issues. This is accomplished through a community-wide fundraising campaign and investment process, a community-wide information and referral program that connects people who need help with local resources and working with other community organizations.
