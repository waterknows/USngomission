The mission of The Free Medical Clinic of Greater Cleveland (The Free Clinic) is to provide quality health care and related services free of charge to those who lack appropriate alternatives, and advocate for policy changes that make health care available to all. The Free Clinic is one of the oldest free clinic in the United States and the largest in Ohio. Established as a hotline in 1970 by a group of people concerned about the health and welfare of young adults, it quickly shifted to a clinic serving the health needs of the community. The facility, located in University Circle, is equipped with 18 exam rooms, five dental chairs, three group therapy rooms, a modern laboratory, and an expanded pharmacy.
