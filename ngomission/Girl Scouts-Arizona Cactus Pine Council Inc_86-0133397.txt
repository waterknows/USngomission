Girl Scouts, Arizona Cactus-Pine Council is Arizona's pre-eminent organization dedicated solely to girls, where, in an accepting and nurturing environment, girls build character and skills for success in the real world. In partnership with committed adult volunteers, Girl Scouts cultivate their full individual potential. The qualities they develop in Girl Scouting - leadership, values, social conscience, and conviction about their own self-worth - serve them all their lives. The Arizona Cactus-Pine Council is unique because we serve a vast jurisdictional area encompassing approximately 75,000 square miles of our great state.
