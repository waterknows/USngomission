Edwin L. Hodges Ministries (ELHM) is a Christian literature ministry, mailing free materials to Bible schools, churches, missionaries, and individuals worldwide (almost entirely outside of the U.S.A.). Incorporated in 1994, the non-denominational ministry is based in Decatur, Alabama. The Ministries' main objective is to help those who have been born again to mature in their faith through the use of Christian literature. The production of Bible study materials, and providing lending libraries, support that goal. At present, ELHM is operated almost entirely by volunteers, nearly 25 of which work on a weekly basis, at the home office and warehouse.
