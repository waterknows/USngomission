The Ronald McDonald House of San Francisco (RMH-SF) provides a safe haven for critically ill children and their families. Our caring staff and volunteers have been helping families since opening our doors in 1989. The RMH-SF provides temporary housing, home-cooked meals and supportive services for families while their children receive specialized treatment in a San Francisco hospital. The House offers a home-like environment where family members find comfort through supportive staff, volunteers and other families in similar situations. Families are stronger when they are together, and their presence helps a sick child heal faster and cope better. While we cannot make medicine taste better or take away painful treatments, we can help lessen the burden and ensure families have the stability and resources to get and keep their child healthy and happy.
