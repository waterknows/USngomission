Rose Foundation for Communities and the Environment is a grantmaking public charity dedicated to inspiring community action for environmental protection, public health and corporate social responsibility. Funding comes from donations, other foundations, legal restitution payments, and government contracts.We have two main programs: New Voices Are Rising and our Grantmaking programs. New Voices develops young leaders in low-income communities of color, building their skills and experience in civic engagement so that they can tackle the many environmental health problems that disproportionately impact their communities.Our grantmaking programs support community-based groups to build long-term solutions benefiting people, the environment and the economy. Grantmaking funds are advised by volunteer funding boards who donate their time and expertise to help Rose Foundation find and support the most strategic, innovative and effective local and grassroots organizations.
