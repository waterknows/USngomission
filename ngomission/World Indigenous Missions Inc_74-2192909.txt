World Indigenous Missions (WIM) began as the dream of missionaries serving in Mexico 30 years ago. They had a common vision to "disciple the nations to reach the world." Currently over 100 WIM missionaries work in 25 nations around the world. World Indigenous Missions is an independent missionary-sending organization. We offer short term mission trips, internships and careers in missions. WIM has three targets which help accomplish our mission. They are evangelizing the lost with the gospel of Jesus Christ, establishing indigenous churches where there were previously none, and equipping indigenous believers to spread the gospel and become church leaders.
