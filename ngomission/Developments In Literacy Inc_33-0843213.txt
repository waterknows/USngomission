Developments in Literacy (DIL) launched in 1997 by Pakistani-Americans with a desire to improve the dismal state of education in Pakistan's underdeveloped areas. DIL currently operates and manages 120 schools with an enrollment of nearly 21,000 students. DIL is dedicated to providing quality education to disadvantaged children, especially girls, by establishing and operating schools in the underdeveloped regions of Pakistan, with a strong focus on gender equality and community participation. DIL establishes, adopts and manages primary and secondary schools for underprivileged children in partnership with non-governmental organizations in all four provinces of Pakistan. In addition, DIL directly operates community schools in Punjab and Sindh.
