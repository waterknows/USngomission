Since 1960, City Rescue Mission has been a center for transformation, changing lives plagued with addiction, poverty, mental illness and homelessness to lives filled with stability, health and hope. Our emergency relief services meet the immediate physical needs of men, women and children who are homeless: nourishing food, a hot shower, clean clothing and a safe night's rest. For some, this help is all they need to get back on their feet. Our recovery program provides opportunities for men, women and families to address life issues-addiction to drugs, alcohol and gambling, domestic violence, lack of education and job skills, mental illness, spiritual bankruptcy-and to gain the confidence and knowledge to become productive members of our community.
