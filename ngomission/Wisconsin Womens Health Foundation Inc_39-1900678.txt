The Wisconsin Women's Health Foundation (WWHF) helps Wisconsin women and their families reach their healthiest potential. Our goals are: to reach all Wisconsin women with the information, opportunities and support they need to be healthy; to encourage women to become advocates for their own health; and to improve the overall quality of life for women and their families. We provide programs and conduct forums that focus on education, prevention and early detection; produce and distribute the most up-to-date educational and resource materials about women's health; and award grants and scholarships to women health researchers and related community non-profits.
