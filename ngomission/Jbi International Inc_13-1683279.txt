JBI International was established in 1931 as the Jewish Braille Institute specifically to provide Hebrew and Yiddish language materials for the blind. Today, The JBI Library offers its readers a collection ranging from mystery novels to cookbooks to timely topics such as the production of biological weapons. It also includes a broad spectrum of biography, history, Holocaust studies, short stories, psychology and self-help, memoirs, humor and more. The JBI Library contains the largest collection of Jewish interest books (very broadly defined) for the blind and visually impaired in the world and is the only resource of its kind.
