Founded in 1918, United Way of Summit County's mission is to improve lives by mobilizing community assets for health and human services. United Way of Summit County is a fundraising and community service organization supporting 122 programs provided by 48 local affiliated health and human service agencies in Summit County, and by non-affiliated agencies that were recipients of Development Fund Grants and Priority Area Grants. Most importantly, the funds donated by an individual or company remain within this community to help our neighbors, co-workers, friends and families.
