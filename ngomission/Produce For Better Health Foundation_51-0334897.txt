Founded in 1991, Produce for Better Health Foundation's (PBH) mission is to achieve increased daily consumption of fruits and vegetables for better health by leveraging private industry and public sector resources, motivating key consumer influencers, and promoting fruits and vegetables directly to consumers. PBH, together with the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) and other national partners, launched in 2007 a new national health initiative: Fruits & Veggies More MattersÂ®, the next generation of the 5 A Day for Better Health campaign. PBH acts as a respected liaison between the industry and the public health community. As a result, no other food group has the public health support that fruits and vegetables enjoy and no other food group can tout that MORE indeed, matters.
