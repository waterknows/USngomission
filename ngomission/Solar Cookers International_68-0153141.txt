Founded in 1987, Solar Cookers International (SCI) spreads solar cooking awareness and skills worldwide, particularly in areas with plentiful sunshine and diminishing sources of cooking fuel. SCI has enabled 30,000 families in Africa to cook with the sun's energy, freeing women and children from the burdens of gathering wood and carrying it for miles. Tens of thousands of individuals and organizations--from all over the world--have learned about solar cooking through SCI's publications and educational materials, and have benefited from SCI's information exchange networks, research, and technical support. SCI is headquartered in Sacramento, California and maintains an office in Nairobi, Kenya.
