A Better Chance is the oldest and only national organization of its kind changing the life trajectory for academically talented youth of color via access to rigorous and prestigious educational opportunities for students in grades 6-12. Founded in 1963, our mission is to increase substantially the number of well-educated young people of color who are capable of assuming positions of responsibility and leadership in American society. We carry out our mission through our signature College Preparatory Schools Program, which annually recruits, refers and supports about 500 scholars at more than 300 member schools in 29 states. More than 13,000 alumni have now gone on to distinguished careers as physicians, artists, educators, lawyers, politicians and corporate executives.
