Founded in 1982 by legendary environmentalist David R. Brower, Earth Island Institute is a public interest membership organization that supports people who are creating solutions to protect our shared planet. Since its founding, Earth Island Institute has been a hub for grassroots campaigns dedicated to conserving, preserving, and restoring the ecosystems on which our civilization depends. Our Project Support program acts as an incubator for start-up environmental projects, giving crucial assistance to groups and individuals with new ideas for promoting ecological sustainability. We also inform and inspire people to take action through our award-winning quarterly magazine, Earth Island Journal. We act as an umbrella organization, providing individual projects with the freedom to develop new initiatives by offering a wide range of professional services.
