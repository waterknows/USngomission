To meet the public's expectation for great medicine, regardless of a patient's ability to pay, Mount Sinai Medical Center Foundation preserves the hospital's rich tradition of philanthropy and community support. Mount Sinai Medical Center Foundation raises funds to support Mount Sinai Medical Center, an acute care teaching and research facility. Mount Sinai Medical Center was founded in 1949 by a group of philanthropists who sought to establish a place where Jewish physicians could freely practice medicine and all persons regardless of race, creed or color could receive high quality medical care. More than five decades later, Mount Sinai continues to provide vital health care services to all citizens.
