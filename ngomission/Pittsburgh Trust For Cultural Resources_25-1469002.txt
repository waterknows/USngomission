The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust was formed in 1984 to stimulate the economic and cultural development of Pittsburgh through the development and promotion of a downtown arts and entertainment district. Encouraging and presenting diverse performing and visual arts programs in the Cultural District, the Trust has helped transform Pittsburgh's Downtown to a vibrant animated area with over fourteen cultural facilities, public parks and plazas, and new and proposed commercial development. Additionally, the Trust is committed to providing educational experiences to a multicultural audience of all ages, working with arts organizations, universities, corporations, and educators to develop educational and entertaining programs that nurture an appreciation for the arts.
