United Way of Southwest Colorado strives to positively impact the community by supporting local agencies and programs that promote education, health, and self-reliance. In United Way's 40 year history of service to Southwest Colorado, we have found that when people join together for the common good things change for the better. United Way targets barriers that families and individuals face that prevent them from thriving. Through our annual Community Investment process, we are partnering with over 50 agencies across the region that are addressing these barriers each and every day.
