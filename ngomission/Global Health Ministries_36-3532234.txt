Established in 1987, Global Health Ministries (GHM) continues the healing ministry of Jesus Christ by enhancing health care programs of Lutheran churches in other countries. GHM funds approved health care projects, scholarships, support for charity patients, capital improvements, and development of appropriate technology. In addition, GHM gathers and ships useful donated health care equipment and supplies to various countries; communicates to groups and congregations the opportunities and needs of the church's overseas health care programs; prays for the church's health care missionaries and those they serve; recruits nurses, dentists, doctors, surgeons, and allied workers for overseas service in training and consultation missions; and advises synods and other groups on health care mission issues.
