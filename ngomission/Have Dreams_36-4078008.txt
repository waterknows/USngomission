Founded in 1996, Have Dreams' mission is to help individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) learn, function independently and socialize so that they may realize their full potential and develop into contributing members of their communities. Have Dreams offers programs for individuals diagnosed with ASD from the age of 16 months through young adulthood. Many families refer to Have Dreams as a “haven of hope” because our extracurricular programs help their child gain important life skills. The support and services we offer help to alleviate the social isolation often experienced by those touched by ASD. As a spectrum disorder, ASD impacts individuals with great variability from moderate to severe. Have Dreams serves individuals across the autism spectrum, affording priority to those with greater challenges as there are fewer alternative options available to them.
