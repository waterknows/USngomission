Forgotten Harvest was formed in 1990 to fight two problems: hunger and waste. In fiscal year 2011 - 2012, Forgotten Harvest will rescue over 42 million pounds of food by collecting surplus prepared and perishable food from a variety of sources including grocery stores, restaurant, caterers, farms, wholesale food distributors and other health department approved sources. This nutritious food is delivered absolutely free of charge to 250 food pantries, shelters, soup kitchens and mobile pantries in the metro Detroit area.
