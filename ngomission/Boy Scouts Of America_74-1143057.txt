Since 1912, the Boy Scouts of America, Capitol Area Council, has worked to prepare every eligible youth in Central Texas to become a responsible, participating citizen and leader who is guided by the Scout Oath and Law. We achieve this annually through thousands of dedicated, talented volunteers and a small number of professional staff. We serve youth, families and communities through Scouting programs in 15 Central Texas counties: Bastrop, Blanco, Burnet, Caldwell, DeWitt, Fayette, Gillespie, Gonzales, Hays, Lavaca, Lee, Llano, Mason, Travis and Williamson.
