CenterStage Foundation, formerly known as the Virginia Performing Arts Foundation, was formed six years ago to bring a new performance center to center city Richmond. Over the past six years, through fundraising, planning and development, the Foundation has brought CenterStage to life. Richmond CenterStage is a new block of serious fun featuring three diverse performance venues and an education center that puts students in the center of the action. Located on the corner of 6th Street and Grace Street, it is surrounded by an exciting, artistic streetscape. CenterStage will feature a wide diversity of top talent from around the world to around the corner performing all on new stages with first class acoustics and brilliant lighting. From the classics to the totally unexpected, get ready for some serious fun.
