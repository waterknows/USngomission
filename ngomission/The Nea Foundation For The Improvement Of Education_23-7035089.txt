The NEA Foundation, through the unique strength of its partnership with educators, advances student achievement by investing in public education that will prepare each of America's children to learn and thrive in a rapidly changing world. Since 1998, the NEA Foundation has provided nearly 4,000 grants totaling $8.5 million to help public school educators improve their students' academic achievement. These grants support a wide array of projects that help improve student achievement, develop creative learning opportunities, and enhance teacher professional development. In addition, the Foundation has invested $10 million to support district-level initiatives to close the achievement gaps.
