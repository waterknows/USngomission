The D.C. Bar Pro Bono Program recruits, trains and mobilizes volunteer attorneys to take pro bono cases serving individuals living in poverty who are at risk of losing their homes, their livelihoods, and their families. The Program also helps small businesses and community-based non-profits needing legal help. Last year, the Pro Bono Program touched the lives of nearly 20,000 D.C. residents. The D.C. Bar Pro Bono Program strives to mobilize the private bar to assist in making legal advice and representation fully available to low-income persons in the District of Columbia.
