The Michigan Environmental Council (MEC) provides a collective voice for the environment at the local, state and federal levels. Working with our 70 member groups and their collective membership of nearly 200,000 residents, MEC is addressing the primary assaults on Michigan's environment; promoting alternatives to urban blight and suburban sprawl; advocating for a sustainable environment and economy; protecting Michigan's water legacy; promoting cleaner energy; and working to diminish environmental impacts on children's health. Since our inception in 1980, MEC has been responsible for countless victories for our environment.
