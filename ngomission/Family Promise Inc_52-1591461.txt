Family Promise is committed to helping low-income families nationwide achieve lasting independence and to redress the underlying causes of poverty and homelessness. We accomplish our mission through four program areas: Interfaith Hospitality Networks (IHNs) - provide shelter, meals, and comprehensive support services to homeless families; Family Mentoring - helps prevent homelessness by training volunteers to be advisors and advocates to low-income families; Just Neighbors - an interactive educational program, raises awareness of the root causes of poverty and homelessness as the first step in establishing community-based responses; and Community Initiatives - fosters local IHN outgrowth programs, such as transitional housing, job training, childcare, and literacy.
