Charity Newsies clothes needy school children. Each year on Drive Day, the second Saturday in December, the Charity Newsies Paper Sale raises thousands of dollars from generous organizations, foundations, businesses and individuals. Newsies also collect contributions through the Annual Auction and Gala, the sale of Hearts and other fundraising activities during the year. Together all these contributions represent the Drive Total, which last year was $1,764,510. In the 2011-2012 school year Charity Newsies clothed 13,002 children.
