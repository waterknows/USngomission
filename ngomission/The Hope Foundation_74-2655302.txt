The Hope Foundation was established in 1993 to support SWOG's mission to eradicate cancer through cancer clinical trials and education. The Hope Foundation has directed approximately $21million toward the support of new and continuing SWOG initiatives in clinical research, education, training, professional development, group meetings, international summits, biostatistical technology and Group infrastructure. SWOG conducts adult cancer clinical trials in prostate, breast, lung, leukemia, gastrointestinal, melanoma, genitourinary, lymphoma, and myeloma, and leads key basic science and genomic medicine investigations in bettering treatments.
