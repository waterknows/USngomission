Opened in 1985, Allen Community Outreach (ACO) has helped families living in Allen, Fairview and Lucas to rebuild their lives through the many services provided. Tools to rebuild the lives of a family in crisis are available though ACO programs and services. Many families may need only short-term assistance, like a 'bridge' built to help them through a crisis. Others' lives have been torn a part, or stripped of everything and they require more specialized assistance and counseling to regain stability within their family. Most of the necessary building blocks are available through financial assistance with household bills, groceries from the Allen Food Pantry, clothing and house wares from the ACO Resale Shop, new school supplies for children in need, and holiday programs providing groceries for a traditional Thanksgiving meal and gifts and toys for children, teens and seniors at Christmas, and more.
