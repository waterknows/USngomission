The National Math and Science Initiative (NMSI) was formed to address one of this nation's greatest economic and intellectual threats - the declining number of students who are prepared to take rigorous college courses in math and science and equipped for careers in those fields. To flourish in the 21st century, the United States must continue to generate intellectual capital that can drive the economic engine of our future prosperity. American students are falling behind in the essential subjects of math and science, putting our position in the global economy at risk. The mission of the National Math and Science Initiative is to help provide the ideas, inspiration, and resources to close the gap.
