Make-A-Wish Illinois grants wishes to children with life-threatening medical conditions to enrich their lives with hope, strength and joy. Since 1985, we have granted more than 13,000 wishes in Illinois. Any child in Illinois between the ages of 2 Â½ and 18 (at the time of referral) with a physician-certified life-threatening illness or medical condition is eligible for a wish. Make-A-Wish Illinois is one of the largest Make-A-Wish chapters in the United States, granting approximately 700 wishes a year.
