Benevilla was created as a not-for-profit organization in 1981 by citizens of the Sun Cities area out of concern that local services were not readily available to the community's residents. Their mission was to promote health and independence by providing supportive services to their neighbors. By cultivating a caring community of neighbors helping neighbors, Benevilla is able to provide extensive support services for older adults, adults with disabilities, children, and the families who care for them. Benevilla programs are supported through donations from individuals, congregations, service clubs, and corporations. These generous individuals and organizations ensure we can meet the needs of our community today and in the future.
