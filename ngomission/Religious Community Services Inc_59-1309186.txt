Religious Community Services' (RCS) mission is to feed the hungry, help families facing homelessness return to self-sufficiency, and empower survivors of domestic violence. RCS directs resources to people facing hunger, homelessness, domestic violence and a lack of basic needs. RCS has evolved into a cooperative of professional staff members, integral volunteers and partnering faith congregations delivering reliable services to those most vulnerable in Pinellas County. RCS continues to use research, communication and best practices to be a premier community based agency providing help & hope to people in need.
