Shiloh International Ministries' purpose is to improve the quality of life of America's disabled and needy children by providing medical necessities and moral support. Shiloh also provides assistance to the homeless and hungry, American Veterans, children's hospitals, and Christians in need everywhere through donations to various organizations that represent those sectors of society. In 2008, Shiloh provided musical shows for Southern California Veterans medical centers, distribute bibles and other religious materials to inmates in California state prisons, and purchased computers and other equipment for disabled children.
