Avenidas provides support, information, and community to enrich the lives of older adults and their families. At Avenidas, we seek to create a community that supports and celebrates older adults. We provide a wide range of support options, information, and services that enable people to stay active, maintain their independence, help their aging parents, or care for a spouse. Our innovative programs and compassionate staff - paid and volunteer - help enrich the lives of more than 6,500 mature adults and their families each year.
