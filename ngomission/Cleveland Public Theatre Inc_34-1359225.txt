Founded in 1981, Cleveland Public Theatre (CPT) works to raise consciousness and nurture compassion through ground breaking performances and life changing educational programs. CPT develops new, adventurous work and nurtures Northeastern Ohio artists -- particularly those whose work is inventive, intelligent, and socially conscious. CPT's acclaimed education programs engage underserved communities in devising new works that speak to contemporary issues, and empower participants to work for positive change in our community.
