Greenville Free Medical Clinic promotes wellness and provides caring, quality primary medical care and dental services, health education and prescription medications without charge to eligible low-income uninsured Greenville County residents. Dedicated and concerned community leaders, under the guidance of founding physician Dr. Lawson Stoneburner, started the Greenville Free Medical Clinic in 1987. In the decades since then, tens of thousands of low-income uninsured patients have received care from volunteer physicians, dentists and nurses at the four clinic sites operated by the organization. Nearly 600 volunteers give of their time and talent each year. Medical experience is not necessary - there are essential volunteer opportunities available in patient registration and screening.
