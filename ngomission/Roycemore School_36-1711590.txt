Roycemore School was founded in 1915 as a girls' school and became coeducational in 1962. The building was designed in the style of then-contemporary English schools. Separate wings house the Lower, Middle, and Upper School classrooms, laboratories and art facilities; a gymnasium/assembly hall is shared by all grades. Roycemore serves students from throughout the Chicago area. Approximately 45% of the students live in Chicago, 35% in Evanston and the remaining 20% in other North Shore suburbs. Roycemore is committed to inspiring personal excellence and celebrating individuality by creating a nurturing, challenging environment for each and every student, from junior kindergarten through grade twelve.
