The San Francisco Symphony (SFS) gave its first concerts in 1911, revitalizing San Francisco's cultural life after the 1906 earthquake. Since that time, the SFS has grown in stature and acclaim, continuing and expanding its tradition of innovation. The SFS sets the highest possible standard for excellence in musical performance at home and around the world. SFS enriches, serves, and shapes cultural life throughout the spectrum of Bay Area communities. To fill the gap left by cuts in school music programs, SFS provides the most extensive education and community programs offered by any American orchestra today. Nearly 30,000 students throughout the Bay Area hear the SFS each year in its Concerts for Kids program, which began in 1919.
