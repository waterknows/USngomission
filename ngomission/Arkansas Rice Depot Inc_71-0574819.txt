The Arkansas Rice Depot works to alleviate hunger in Arkansas. The Arkansas Rice Depot has spent more than 25 years developing a presence across Arkansas. We feed those in need through a network of more than 800 local hunger-relief organizations. In addition to the local food pantries, shelters, soup kitchens & schools that participate in our network, the Arkansas Rice Depot provides ten regional food drops so food pantries outside of central Arkansas don't have to make the long drive into Little Rock to access our food donation network. The Arkansas Rice Depot reaches out to those Arkansans in need through a variety of programs including Food For Kids, Food For Seniors & Disaster Relief.
