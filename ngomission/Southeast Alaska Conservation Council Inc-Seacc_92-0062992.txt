The Southeast Alaska Conservation Council (SEACC) has worked in the region since 1970. Together with our allies-local communities, commercial and sport fishermen, Alaska Natives, tourism and recreation business owners, small-scale value-added wood product manufacturers, hunters and guides, and Americans from all walks of life-we've worked hard to protect important fish and wildlife habitat, reduce destructive clear-cutting on the Tongass National Forest, and improve community sustainability in the region.The Southeast Alaska Conservation Council's mission is to protect the special places of the world's largest temperate rainforest, promote conservation, and advocate for sustainability in human use of natural resources. Inspired by the land, wildlife, cultures, and communities of Southeast Alaska, SEACC strives to ensure this interconnected whole exists for future generations.
