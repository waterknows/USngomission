The purpose of the Community Arts Music Association (CAMA) is to enrich Santa Barbara's cultural life by the presentation of a variety of live performances by world-renowned performers and orchestras at the highest level of artistic excellence. Our mission to serve the community includes a commitment to expand and enrich audience appreciation and education through various forms of media and to offer associated music outreach programs to the widest possible audience. CANA sponsors four programs in education and outreach: elementary school outreach; the junior, middle and high school ticket program; youth audience development; and adult education.
