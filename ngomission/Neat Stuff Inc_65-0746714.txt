Established in 1995, Neat Stuff provides free brand new clothing, shoes, accessories and gifts to meet some of

the basic needs of abused, neglected and other children in distress, allowing them to dress with pride and dignity,

inspiring their self worth. Neat Stuff serves children from birth to 18 who are in foster care, shelters, and are referred by participating agencies. These children, and those who care for them, face enough challenges. A book to read, shoes that fit properly, underwear with no holes, and a new pair of jeans is the least we can do to help lift their spirits. Many foster children are removed from their homes with only the clothes they are wearing.
