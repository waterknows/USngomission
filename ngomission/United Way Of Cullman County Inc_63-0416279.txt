United Way of Cullman County works to improve the lives by mobilizing the caring power of communities and promoting the collection and responsible distribution of charitable funds. Our vision is to become everyone's first choice for charitable contributions supporting Cullman County. Our work focuses on three main areas: education, income, and health.
