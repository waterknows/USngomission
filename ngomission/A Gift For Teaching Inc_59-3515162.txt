Since 1998, A Gift for Teaching (AGFT) has worked to improve public education by transferring our community's surplus materials and resources free to teachers for their students in need. AGFT's concept is beautifully simple: local businesses take unwanted supplies or surplus merchandise that would otherwise get thrown away and donate it for distribution through the Free Store for teachers. More than 7,535 teachers from Central Florida's highest need schools can then shop for free to make sure the more than 180,000 students in our community have what they need to learn. At AGFT, we offer additional programs that expand the scope of learning for students and teachers in music, art and physical education.
