The Maui Food Bank helps the hungry in Maui County by collecting and distributing food through community partnerships. It is our goal to end hunger on Maui. We work toward that goal by distributing food and advocating for improvement in government food programs and food policies. A statewide network of suppliers allows the Maui Food Bank to turn each dollar donated into 6 lbs. of non-perishable groceries, as well as fresh produce, bread, meat, fish and poultry. This year the Maui Food Bank will distribute over 1.8 million pounds of food and serve over 10,000 people a month who are in need of food.
