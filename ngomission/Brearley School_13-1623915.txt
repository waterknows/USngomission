Since its founding in 1884, Brearley School has worked to prepare girls exceptionally well for active and responsible citizenship in an increasingly borderless world. Brearley is an all-girl, nondenominational independent college-preparatory day school for grades K-12, with a current enrollment of 690 students and a student/faculty ratio of 6:1. Balancing their unparalleled academic education with travel study, community service, a wide range of opportunities in the visual and performing arts, an extensive athletics program and an ever-expanding selection of student-run clubs and committees, our students also develop a strong sense of personal integrity; they take seriously their responsibility to engage with the world in productive and principled ways.
