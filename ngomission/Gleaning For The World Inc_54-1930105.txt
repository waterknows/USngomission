Founded in 1998, Gleaning For The World (GFTW) seeks to provide life-saving support to communities in critical need throughout the world by applying a powerful concept that we call gleaning. We provide surplus medical and essential supplies to humanitarian projects worldwide. GFTW provides expedited distribution channels, efficient logistical support and dependable service between corporate donors and mission groups at the lowest possible cost. We believe that all God's children are created equal and are deserving of a compassionate and reliable source of critical supplies, regardless of ethnic, religious or cultural background.
