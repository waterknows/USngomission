The mission of El Hogar is to transform and empower abandoned and hopelessly poor children in Honduras by providing a loving home and education. Our goal is for them to fulfill their ultimate potential as productive, caring and independent Honduran citizens. At El Hogar, we find the most desperate children – the ones on the streets, the ones without enough to eat, the ones at most risk — and show them what a better future looks like. We give them the love, the support and the tools to help make this vision their new reality.
