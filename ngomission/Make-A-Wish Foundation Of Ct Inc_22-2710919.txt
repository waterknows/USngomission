The sole purpose of the Make-A-Wish Foundation of Connecticut is to grant the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions to enrich the human experience with hope, strength and joy. We want to provide children with the hope for better times, the strength for the tough times and the joy to experience the present. Make-A-Wish Connecticut has granted over 2,500 wishes since our founding in 1986.
