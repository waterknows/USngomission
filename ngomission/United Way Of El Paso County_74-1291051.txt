The United Way of El Paso County is committed to more than just supporting programs that serve identified needs in the community. The mission of the United Way is to improve the lives of El Paso families through the caring power of the community we live in. And to Live United means mobilizing that power to support and, where necessary, develop programs that also address the underlying causes of the community's needs, with the long-term goal of ending those needs.
