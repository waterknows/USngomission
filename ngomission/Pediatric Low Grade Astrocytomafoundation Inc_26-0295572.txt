A Kids' Brain Tumor Cure Foundation (a/k/a PLGA Foundation), founded in 2007, is dedicated to finding more effective, less toxic and less punishing treatments for eradicating low grade glioma brain cancer in children. Our goal is to accelerate the pace of promising scientific pediatric brain tumor research through: taising funds to support state of the art scientific research and raising awareness with scientists, doctors, lay people and pharmaceutical companies about the lack of existing effective treatments and a cure. It is simply unacceptable that children diagnosed with this pernicious disease are suffering due to the lack of advancements in scientific understanding of pediatric brain tumors. Recent developments in the scientific arena and agreement among scientists around the world confirm that more effective treatments are on the horizon for all children battling brain tumors provided that funding is available. AKBTC is accelerating its efforts to raise funds and awareness so that all children can fight for their dreams not for their lives.
