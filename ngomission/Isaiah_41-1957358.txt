Founded in 2000, ISAIAH was officially created through the merger of three independent congregation based community organizations: Great River Interfaith Partnership (GRIP) in the St. Cloud area; Interfaith Action in Greater Minneapolis; and, St. Paul Ecumenical Alliance of Congregations (SPEAC) in Greater St. Paul. Today, ISAIAH is a faith-based coalition of more than 100 member congregations that lets communities in Minnesota more effectively live out their faith in biblical justice and the common good. By uniting local congregations in a large regional organization, ISAIAH strengthens the ability of people of faith to address both local and regional community issues, including sprawl, affordable housing, transportation, and racial inequity.
