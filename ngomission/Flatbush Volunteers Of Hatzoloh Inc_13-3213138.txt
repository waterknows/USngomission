Flatbush Volunteers of Hatzoloh has over 200 volunteers and operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week throughout the communities of Flatbush, Midwood, Kensington, Marine Park, Madison, Sheepshead Bay and Brighton Beach. We respond to over 15,000 calls annually. We provide a high level of pre-hospital lifesaving treatment and transport free of charge to anyone who calls, regardless of race, religion, or ethnicity. Every one of the 200+ Flatbush Hatzoloh rescue workers, including Emergency Medical Technicians, Paramedics, Doctors, and Dispatchers is a volunteer. Hatzoloh members must complete rigorous N.Y.S. Department of Health training programs in emergency medical care, and must be re-certified by New York State every three years.
