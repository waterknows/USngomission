The mission of the U.S. Soccer Foundation is to enhance, assist and grow the sport of soccer in the United States with a special emphasis on underserved communities. We view soccer as a powerful vehicle for social change. By supporting the development of places to play, places to grow and places to learn, our goal is to ensure that children in underserved communities have easy and affordable access to quality soccer programs that support their physical and personal development.
