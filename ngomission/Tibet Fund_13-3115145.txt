The Tibet Fund's mission is to preserve the distinct cultural identity of the Tibetan people. Since 1981, under the patronage of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, The Tibet Fund has been the primary funding organization for health care, education, refugee rehabilitation, religious and cultural preservation, elder care, and community and economic development programs serving hundreds of thousands of Tibetan refugees living in India, Nepal and Bhutan.  Our aim is to promote self-reliance and help sustain the cohesiveness of the exile community. In Tibet, our support is directed to education, emergency relief, healthcare, and social enterprise programs that aid impoverished and marginalized Tibetans. The Tibet Fund also administers sponsorship programs for individual support of Tibetan children, monks, nuns, and elders.
