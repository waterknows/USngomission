KYA has worked for over 35 years to improve child well-being and public policies that influence the lives of children and families. With compelling, solid data in one hand and unrivaled expertise and advocacy skills in the other, we work hard to ensure that decision makers invest in and maintain programs that keep children and families healthy, safe and secure.
