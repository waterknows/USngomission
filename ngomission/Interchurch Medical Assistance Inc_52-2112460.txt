Our mission is to build healthier communities by collaborating with key partners to serve vulnerable people. IMA believes all people are children of God and thus deserve to lead healthy and productive lives. Our vision of health, healing, and well-being for all is based on the Christian call to serve one another. The founding members of IMA, Protestant Churches and church-based organizations, chose to be intentionally ecumenical to provide health services and to build healthy communities around the world. We can do more together than alone; that spirit of joint action remains foundational to IMA today. IMA believes the core ecumenical imperatives are unity and respect for all faiths and traditions.
