Wyman's mission is to enable teens from disadvantaged circumstances to lead successful lives and build strong communities. Our vision is to foster communities where every teen is expected and supported to thrive in life, work and learning so that they may become economically self-sufficient, leaders in their communities and, ultimately, break the cycle of poverty.
