Founded in 1888, The Park School is an independent, coeducational, non-sectarian day school for students from pre-kindergarten to grade nine. The Park School is dedicated to excellence in education. The cornerstone of Park's program is academic excellence, combining both high standards of scholarship and the encouragement of each child to develop to his or her greatest potential. The school provides a nurturing environment in which children can develop curiosity, express creativity, appreciate the value of hard work and discipline, and experience the joy of learning. Park's faculty encourages individual students to strive for intellectual, physical and moral growth, and to become contributing members of the community.
