Founded in 2007, Michigan Community Resources works to support and empower nonprofit community organizations in Michigan that serve low-income individuals and communities, with an emphasis on community economic development, by providing pro bono legal services and technical assistance. Originally known as Community Legal Resources, we grew from a legal service provider for nonprofits to a comprehensive support organization for low-income communities in Michigan. We provide the legal, community organizing and urban planning skills and resources community-based organizations and low-income communities need to revitalize and thrive.
