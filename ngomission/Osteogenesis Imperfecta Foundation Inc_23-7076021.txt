The Osteogenesis Imperfecta Foundation (OI Foundation) is the only voluntary national health organization dedicated to helping people cope with the problems associated with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). A genetic disorder known as brittle bone disease, OI is characterized by bones that break easily. Founded in 1970, the OI Foundation's mission is to improve the quality of life for people affected by OI through research, education, awareness, and mutual support. Since its inception, the OI Foundation has doubled funding for research every five years, for a total investment of almost $3 million. A biennial national conference provides more than 570 people with medical, research, and coping information.
