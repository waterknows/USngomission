Located one-half mile outside the Capital Beltway in North Bethesda, Maryland, Strathmore provides affordable, accessible, multi-disciplinary arts programming in the Mansion at Strathmore, the Music Center at Strathmore, and on its scenic 11-acre site. Founded in 1981, the arts center presents a lively and diverse program of art exhibitions, concerts and performing arts programs, and literary lectures and events. As Strathmore is deeply committed to maintaining affordable and accessible arts programs to all audiences, an abiding partnership of both private and public support for Strathmore is required to nurture and perpetuate this creative endeavor - to provide a home for the arts in our growing community.
