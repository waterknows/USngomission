Founded in 1975, American Composers Orchestra (ACO) identifies today's brightest emerging composers, champions prominent established composers as well as those lesser-known, and increases regional, national and international awareness of the infinite variety of American orchestral music, reflecting geographic, stylistic, and temporal diversity. To date, ACO has performed music by nearly 500 American composers, including more than 100 world premieres and newly commissioned works. In pursuit of its singular mission, ACO maintains an unparalleled range of activities including an annual concert series at Carnegie Hall, commissions, recordings, radio broadcasts, educational programs, and new music reading sessions. New initiatives include composer fellowships and special projects designed to serve and advance the field.
