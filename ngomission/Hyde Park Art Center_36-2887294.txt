Hyde Park Art Center has been a leader in advancing contemporary visual art in Chicago since 1939. With an expansive reach and bold personality, the nonprofit organization brings artists and communities together to support creativity at every level. As an open forum for exploring the artistic process, the Art Center fosters creativity through making, learning about, seeing, and discussing artâ€”all under one roof. By developing socially adept programming that finds new ways to engage diverse audiences in the work of Chicago's artists, the Art Center makes space for transparent interaction with art and the artistic process, inspiring creative exploration and encouraging exchange between audiences and artists. Outside its walls, the Art Center's outreach programs in historically underserved neighborhoods bring the visual arts to Chicago youth, their teachers, and their families.
