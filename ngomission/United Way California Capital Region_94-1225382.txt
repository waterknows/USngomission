United Way California Capital Region seeks to build stronger, healthier, and more compassionate communities. Working with 750 employers in Amador, El Dorado, Placer, Sacramento and Yolo counties, we hold workplace giving campaigns to raise support for local nonprofits who share our mission and for our United Way Projects that bring together these nonprofits to tackle tough issues in our community. United Way's Community Impact Fund currently provides grants to our four projects: coverage for kids; foster youth flourish; keeping kids safe; and turning teens toward success.
