Established in 1954, the mission of the Wisconsin Historical Foundation (WHF) is to strengthen the Wisconsin Historical Society's ability to fulfill its public mandate and mission to help people connect to the past. The WHF fulfills its mission by increasing awareness, engaging with audiences, and fostering philanthropic relationships throughout Wisconsin and beyond, and by seeking resources and solutions that make visionary and entrepreneurial ideas possible. The Society was founded in 1846, two years before Wisconsin became the 30th state, and it ranks as one of the largest, most active, and most diversified state historical societies in the nation. The Society helps people connect to the past by collecting, preserving and sharing stories.
