Boys & Girls Aid works to secure lifelong connections for every child in Oregon. Regardless of age or background, we believe children belong in families that are permanent and stable. While every child deserves a family, not every child has a family. Between the ages of 0 to 23, we have a focus on making sure every child has a lifelong adult connected to their future.We do not simply find families, we find the right families for children in need. When children enter our care, they are connected with trained adults who prepare them for the next step. Whether than means returning home or growing with a family through adoption, our goal is that children exit our care with the tools to rise above a history of abuse or neglect and thrive as adults.
