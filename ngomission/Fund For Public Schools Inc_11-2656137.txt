The Fund for Public Schools works to attract private investment in school reform and to encourage greater involvement of all New Yorkers in the education of our children. This includes working to secure critical funding for system-wide education reform initiatives; facilitating strategic public-private partnerships; managing a targeted set of programs to support city schools; and building city-wide public awareness. In 2002 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Chancellor Joel I. Klein established public-private partnerships as a critical means of supporting public education reform, and The Fund is the primary vehicle for advancing this effort. The Fund has secured unprecedented investment, raising more than $230 million for system-wide reforms and initiatives that support individual schools.
