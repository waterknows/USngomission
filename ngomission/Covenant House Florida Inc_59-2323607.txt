Covenant House Florida serves runaway, homeless, and at-risk youth under 21 including teen parents and their babies. We opened in Ft. Lauderdale in 1985 and expanded to Orlando in 1995. Every day, we reach over 200 kids in Ft. Lauderdale and Orlando via our street outreach, crisis shelters, transitional housing projects, and walk-in and aftercare services, making Covenant House Florida one of the largest private agencies serving runaway and homeless youth in the state of Florida. We who recognize God's providence and fidelity to His people are dedicated to living out His covenant among ourselves and those children we serve, with absolute respect and unconditional love.
