The Bowery Mission (legal name Christian Herald Association) traces its roots back to 1879. The Bowery Mission's goal is to be the most effective provider of compassionate care and life transformation services for hurting people in New York City. We are called to minister in New York City to men, women, and children caught in cycles of poverty, hopelessness, and dependencies of many kinds, and to see their lives transformed to hope, joy, lasting productivity and spiritual wholeness. in 2014, The Bowery Mission's combined programs provided homeless men and women with more than 392,000 meals, 98,000 nights of shelter and 45,000 articles of clothing, as well as nearly 800 free medical and optometry appointments and over 300 crisis intervention referrals. We served over 300 adults in our residential recovery programs and provided over 1,000 at risk children and youth with summer camp experiences and year-round mentoring and educational opportunities.
