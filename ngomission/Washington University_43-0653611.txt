The mission of Washington University is the promotion of learning - learning by students and by faculty. Teaching, the transmission of knowledge, is central to our mission, as is research, the creation of new knowledge. Faculty composed of scholars, scientists, artists, and members of the learned professions serve society by teaching; by adding to the store of human art, understanding, and wisdom; and by providing direct services, such as health care. 



Our goals are: to foster excellence in our teaching, research, scholarship, and service; to prepare students with the attitudes, skills, and habits of lifelong learning and with leadership skills, enabling them to be useful members of a global society; and to be an exemplary institution in our home community, St. Louis, as well as in the nation and the world.
