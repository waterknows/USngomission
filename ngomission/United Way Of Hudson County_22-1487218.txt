United Way of Hudson County's mission is to improve the lives of the women, men and children in our communities by mobilizing the caring power of our leaders in government and the non-profit and corporate sectors, so they may have the greatest effective impact on improving the quality of life in our communities. United Way workers and volunteers reach out, network and motivate individuals and corporations with access to financial and material resources so that we can improve the lives of those in need and provide positive community impact.
