Lives Under Construction Boys Ranch is a residential treatment home for at-risk boys between the ages of 7-21. We desire to help each boy find his way back to his family by changing his behaviors and by helping him discover those things about himself that help him re-build a positive structure for a successful future. This is done through behavior management techniques and individualized counseling, whereby goals are set for each young man, with the staff helping each boy achieve his goals. Through the use of Biblical counseling and applying Christian principles in their lives, we are re-building broken homes and family relationships.
