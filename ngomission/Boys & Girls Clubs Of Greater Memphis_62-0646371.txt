Since 1962, Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Memphis has offered leadership and support to thousands of youth ages 6-18. Through one-to-one interaction with trained adult staff, Club members learn to make positive decisions about their lives. They do better in school, stay away from drugs and gangs and begin to set personal goals for themselves, which ultimately helps them be responsible citizens of our community. We inspire and enable all young people, especially those who need us the most, to realize their full potential as productive, responsible, caring citizens.
