Since 1980, the Make-A-Wish Foundation has given hope, strength and joy to children with life-threatening medical conditions. From our humble beginnings with one boy's wish to be a police officer, we've evolved into an organization that grants a child's wish in the United States and its territories every 40 minutes. We grant the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions to enrich the human experience with hope, strength and joy.
