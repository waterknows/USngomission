The Delta Waterfowl Foundation works to secure the future of waterfowl and waterfowl hunting. Delta provides knowledge, leaders, and science-based solutions that efficiently conserve waterfowl and secure the future for waterfowl hunting. Its principal work is the funding and supervision of graduate research studies designed to enhance waterfowl populations at Delta. Students have carried out projects that have greatly increased our understanding of waterfowl and their habitat. In addition to conducting high-quality research and training students, the Delta Waterfowl Foundation also communicates results, evaluates new scientific techniques, influences public policy, and preserves and promotes hunting as an integral part of waterfowl management.
