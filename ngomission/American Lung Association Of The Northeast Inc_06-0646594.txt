On July 1, 2012 the American Lung Association of New England merged with the American Lung Association of New York to become the American Lung Association of the Northeast. Since 1904, the American Lung Association has worked to fight lung disease by helping people quit smoking, funding research, improving indoor and outdoor air quality, and educating millions about asthma. The American Lung Association in New England serves Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont. We are the oldest voluntary health agency in the U.S. Our focus today is on healthy air, tobacco control and all lung disease, including asthma and COPD. Our mission is to prevent lung disease and promote lung health and we do that through education, research and advocacy.
