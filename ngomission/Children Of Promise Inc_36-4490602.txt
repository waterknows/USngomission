Children of Promise exists to provide assistance in the development of the spiritual, physical, educational, emotional, and social lives of children touched by ministries of the Church of God. As the child sponsorship ministry of the Church of God, Children of Promise partners with Church of God congregations in 27 countries across the globe to provide food, schooling, health care, and spiritual nurture to children in need. Begun in 1992, the ministry now reaches children in poor, isolated villages as well as those in teeming, urban slums. Wherever children need help, Children of Promise wants to be there.
