Helping Children Worldwide is a Christian organization that is transforming communities by serving the world's most vulnerable through education, health care, and spiritual growth.  We work alongside partners both in the U.S. and Africa to create programs of excellence, which impact more than 10,000 people each year. Our vision is strong, nurturing communities where all can fulfill their God-given potential through good health and education.
