Founded in 1989, the Coastal Conservation League works to protect the natural environment of the South Carolina coastal plain and to enhance the quality of life of our communities by working with individuals, businesses and government to ensure balanced solutions. From the white sand beaches and pristine marshes to the freshwater swamps and pine savannahs, we focus on the most efficient and effective ways to protect natural habitats, the wildlife that depends on them, and the variety of benefits they bring to this state. We also believe that the communities we live in are important, and that our quality of life deserves the same high level of attention. We envision beautiful and livable communities, surrounded by productive agricultural lands and wild lands rich with biodiversity.
