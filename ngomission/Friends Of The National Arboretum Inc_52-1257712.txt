Friends of the National Arboretum (FONA)'s mission is to preserve and enhance the U.S. National Arboretum. We work to provide valuable financial and volunteer support, especially for Arboretum internship programs, maintenance of the gardens and collections, The Washington Youth Garden and many other projects. Our focus areas include environmental preservation, plant research, urban greenspace, education, and community outreach.
