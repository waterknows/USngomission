Founded in 1929, the mission of the Robert E. Lee Memorial Association is to restore and preserve Stratford Hall, the home of the Lees of Virginia and birthplace of Robert E. Lee for the benefit of the general public and historical study. Stratford Hall's educational programs offer many opportunities to develop a deeper understanding of a variety of topics, including the Lee family, the Civil War, cultural landscapes, and slavery. Each year, faculty members at local universities help Stratford Hall's educational staff plan and run these residential symposia.
