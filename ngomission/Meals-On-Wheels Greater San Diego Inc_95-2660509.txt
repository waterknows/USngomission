The mission of Meals-on-Wheels Greater San Diego is to support the independence and well being of seniors. Meals-on-Wheels home-delivers two meals a day, for seven days a week (including holidays), and provides modified diets, to seniors, age 60 and older, throughout San Diego County from San Ysidro to Oceanside, Alpine to the Coast, and most areas in between. Meals-on-Wheels is committed to reducing the isolation experienced by so many elderly. Meals are delivered to seniors' homes by volunteers. Frequently the volunteer may be the only person the senior sees all day, providing human contact and a safety net, particularly for those seniors living alone.
