Children's Relief Mission (CRM) is dedicated to providing resources for families and communities at home and abroad who are determined to create better lives for their children--for they are our children as well, and they will craft the world for our children's children. To accomplish this goal, we offer relief and development assistance that provides for medical care, education, feeding programs and economic support for children and families. We seek to nurture as many children as we can, always focusing on the long-term needs and opportunities they present to us, never being satisfied with the temporary or superficial solution. We are selective, as good stewards must be. We want to be an enduring presence in the lives of the children we serve.
