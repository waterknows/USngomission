Founded in 1966, the Wing Luke Museum of the Asian Pacific American Experience works to connect everyone to the rich history, dynamic cultures and art of the Asian Pacific Americans through vivid storytelling and inspiring experiences. Our facilities offers three floors to tell our communities' stories, with contemporary galleries showcasing both temporary and permanent exhibitions as well as preserved historic spaces. Beyond our walls, we like to tell the story of our neighborhood, Seattle's Chinatown-International District. The Wing offers guided neighborhood tours and events that will encourage you to discover stories and tastes both on- and off-the-beaten path.
