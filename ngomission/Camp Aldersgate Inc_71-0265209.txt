Camp Aldersgate is uniquely dedicated to serving children with disabilities, youth and senior adults in a camp environment. We maintain a high standard of excellence in all aspects of our programming, service, environment and operations. Our work is guided by the needs and potential of each person. We offer camps for children and youth who have conditions such as cancer, muscular dystrophy, spina bifida, cerebral palsy, diabetes, arthritis, asthma, epilepsy, kidney disorders, autism, Down syndrome, and mental retardation. Hundreds of campers come each year from across Arkansas and from surrounding states to enjoy an experience of a lifetime.
