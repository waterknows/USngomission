SMART (Start Making a Reader Today) partners with hundreds of schools statewide to deliver proven literacy support to K-3 children. Teachers recommend students for participation in the program, which complements the school's curriculum. Local SMART Coordinators recruit and train community volunteers to read once a week from October to May with two children. The consistent, one-on-one relationship gives children the attention, self-confidence, and skills to succeed in school and beyond. SMART further encourages children to read outside the classroom by giving them new books each month. SMART serves about 10,000 children each year.
