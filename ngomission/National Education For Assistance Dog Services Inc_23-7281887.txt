NEADS (National Education for Assistance Dog Services), also known as Dogs for Deaf and Disabled Americans, was established in 1976 to train and provide independence to people who are deaf or physically disabled through the use of canine assistance. These Assistance Dogs become an extension of their owners and bring security, freedom, independence and relief from social isolation to their human partners. NEADS trains all breeds and mixed breeds of dogs to help people who are deaf or physically disabled live more independently. NEADS has trained well over 1500 Assistance Dog teams from all states since 1976. Each year we train over 50 teams and hold two graduation ceremonies per year to mark the occasions.
