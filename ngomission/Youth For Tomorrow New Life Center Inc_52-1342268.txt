Founded in 1986, Youth for Tomorrow (YFT) is committed to providing a safe, healthy, and compassionate environment for at-risk youth who have been abandoned, abused, or otherwise alienated from family and community. Our mission is to provide them the opportunity and motivation to focus their lives and develop the confidence, skills, intellectual ability, spiritual insight and moral integrity to become responsible and productive members of society. YFT programs are designed to meet the needs of children ages 11-17 struggling with a variety of difficulties at home and school. Since our doors opened, we have served 800 children.
