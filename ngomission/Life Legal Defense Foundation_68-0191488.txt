The mission of Life Legal Defense Foundation (LLDF) is to give innocent and helpless human beings of any age, particularly unborn children, a trained and committed defense against the threat of death, and to support their advocates in the nation's courtrooms. LLDF accomplishes its mission and purpose through the law and education. LLDF's everyday activity involves hundreds of cases which are not reported in the media, but which raise vital issues of freedom and effectiveness for our clients. LLDF has litigated on a number of exceptional cases, including unconstitutional ordinances aimed at limiting speech rights of clients; unconstitutional law enforcement of ordinances aimed at silencing pro-life expression; and the active killing of the disabled.
