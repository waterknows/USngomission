The Blind Children's Center's mission is to foster the development and education of children - birth through 2nd grade - who are visually impaired in an inclusive, family-focused setting. The Center was founded in 1938 by Southern California Delta Gammas. Each year the Center serves approximately 100 children who are blind or visually impaired and provides an array of support services for more than 350 family members. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive program of specialized education and training which will optimize our students' development and opportunities to lead a meaningful and productive life. We are committed to a family-focused approach where parents, siblings, grandparents, and caregivers are included in the educational process every step of the way. In keeping with best practices, our programs are fully inclusive with sighted children integrated in each class, providing unique opportunities for social interaction and acquisition of critical skills.
