Matt Talbot Kitchen & Outreach (MTKO) is a faith-based hunger relief and outreach program devoted to serving Lincoln's homeless and near homeless men, women, and children. MTKO is always a welcoming and supportive environment for those most vulnerable. We also serve the community at large by coordinating one of the largest volunteer efforts (over 800 volunteers each month) in the Lincoln community. MTKO serves lunch and dinner seven days a week, 365 days a year. A majority of the food is donated and served by volunteer hunger relief teams. In 2003, with the expansion of outreach and homeless prevention services, another renovation was completed to update the food preparation area, expand the overcrowded dining room, and create additional office space for new staff.
