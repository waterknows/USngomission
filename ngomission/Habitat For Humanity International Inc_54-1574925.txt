Habitat for Humanity of Greater Charlottesville was founded in 1991 as an affiliate of Habitat for Humanity International. Over the past two decades, we have built homes in partnership with more than 140 local low-income families. We also currently manage two trailer parks, and own the local Habitat Store, which raises money for Habitat homes by selling building products and other donated materials. Habitat for Humanity of Greater Charlottesville works to create simple, decent, affordable housing in partnership with low-income families, volunteers and the communities of greater Charlottesville.
