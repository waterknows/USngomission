The Marshall Legacy Institute (MLI) is a Virginia-based non-profit organization committed to helping war-torn countries help themselves. Our current focus is eliminating the humanitarian dangers and the destabilizing effects of landmines. MLI assists war-torn countries in building humanitarian, sustainable and affordable programs to eradicate landmines and alleviate the suffering caused by these instruments of war. MLI utilizes U.S. Government funding and the support of private donors to achieve these goals. To date, MLI has assisted 13 severely mine-contaminated countries by donating 171 lifesaving dogs to sniff out mines, providing assistance to hundreds of survivors, and engaging thousands of American youth in the landmine problem.
