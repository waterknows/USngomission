The mission of Judi's House is to help children & families, grieving the death of a loved one, find hope & healing within themselves. At Judi's House, our vision is a world in which no child should ever have to feel alone in grief. We expect to achieve this vision by adhering to 3 core values: respect, accountability, and compassion.
