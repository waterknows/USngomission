Boston Ballet, founded in 1963 by E. Virginia Williams, was the first professional repertory ballet company in New England. Boston Ballet, a professional dance company and the region's second-largest performing arts organization, is dedicated to the highest standards of dance performance, training, and education. The Company presents fully staged classical and contemporary works each season. Performances reach a broadly inclusive audience of over 150,000 from throughout the state and region, and support an institutional mission that values leadership, innovation, and partnership. Boston Ballet School serves an associated imperative to train dancers of all ages and provide general access to the art of dance.
