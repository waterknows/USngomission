The mission of Urban Ministries of Durham (UMD) is to provide food, clothing, shelter and supportive services to our neighbors in need. Our core values are to carry out this mission while providing a welcoming, caring and compassionate environment that affirms the dignity of our guests, volunteers and staff. Urban Ministries of Durham was developed and is partially supported by a diverse group of faith communities as well as many individuals, foundations, corporations, and levels of government. UMD distinguishes itself from other organizations that care for Durham's homeless and impoverished neighbors by serving as a comprehensive service provider of food, shelter, clothing and supportive services for over 6,000 men, women and children annually.
