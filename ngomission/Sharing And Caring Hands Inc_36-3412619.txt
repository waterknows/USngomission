Founded in 1985 by Mary Jo Copeland, Sharing and Caring Hands is a compassionate response to the needs of the poor. We are set up to be a safety net organization to help with whatever needs are not being met. This includes but is not limited to providing meals, clothing, showers, shelter, transportation help, rent deposits, rent help, medical assistance, dental care, furniture, school expenses, funeral assistance, and other miscellaneous needs. Sharing and Caring Hands provides these with dignity, while affirming God's love for all his people regardless of their circumstances. We reaffirm the self-worth of each individual and want to assist in that person reaching his or her greatest potential.
