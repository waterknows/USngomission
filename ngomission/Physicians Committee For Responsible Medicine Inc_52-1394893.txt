Founded in 1985, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) is an organization supported by doctors and laypersons working together for compassionate and effective medical practice, research, and health promotion. We encourage higher standards for ethics and effectiveness in research by opposing unethical human experiments and promoting alternatives to animal research. PCRM has led the way for reforms of federal nutrition policies. Our clinical research programs are breaking new ground in diabetes, cancer, and other serious conditions, and our public service announcements feature medical experts on prevention and health.
