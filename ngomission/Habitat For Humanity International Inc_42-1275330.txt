The Greater Des Moines Habitat for Humanity seeks to put God's love into action and to bring people together to build homes, communities, and hope. GDM Habitat is an ecumenical Christian ministry founded on the conviction that every man, woman and child should have a decent, safe and affordable place to live. We build with people in need regardless of race or religion. We welcome volunteers and supporters from all backgrounds.
