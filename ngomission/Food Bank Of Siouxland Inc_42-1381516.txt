The Food Bank of Siouxland strives to be responsive to the needs of its agencies, donors and volunteers. We were established to provide a year-round source of food to these organizations. Today our outreach includes eleven counties in the Siouxland area. Currently, the Food Bank of Siouxland provides food to nearly 125 member agencies, consisting of food pantries, emergency relief agencies, shelters, children's homes, day care centers, rehabilitation programs, senior citizens centers and other outreach programs.
