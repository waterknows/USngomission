Since its inception in 1995, the National Ovarian Cancer Coalition (NOCC) has been committed to raising awareness of ovarian cancer in communities across the country and to providing education, support and hope for women with ovarian cancer and their families. NOCC has established itself as an important national advocate for patients and families struggling with ovarian cancer. Committed volunteers continue to build chapters throughout the country and work together to advance NOCC's education and awareness efforts. The Chapter network is the heart and soul of NOCC. It continues to grow and provides services in local communities throughout the nation.
