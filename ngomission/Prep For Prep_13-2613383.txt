Prep for Prep develops leaders through access to superior education and life-changing opportunities. Since 1978, Prep has identified New York City's most promising students of color and prepared them for placement at independent schools in the city and boarding schools throughout the Northeast. Once placed, Prep offers support and opportunities to ensure the academic accomplishment and personal growth of each one of our students.  More than 4,500 members of the Prep Community, who are rapidly assuming leadership positions in a wide variety of endeavors, are living proof that the potential for academic and professional success exists in all ethnic groups and socioeconomic classes. Our students, who come from modest backgrounds, succeed at the best independent schools in New York City, the top boarding schools in the country, and the most prestigious colleges and universities in the world.
