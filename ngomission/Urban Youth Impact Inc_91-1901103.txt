Urban Youth Impact (UYI) exists to love, equip and empower inner-city youth and their parents to fulfill their God-given purpose. Founded in 1997, UYI seeks to reverse troubling trends and fulfill its mission by offering programs designed to develop critical life-skills that result in less juvenile crime, fewer teen pregnancies, less substance abuse, less child abuse/domestic violence, and fewer school drop-outs.
