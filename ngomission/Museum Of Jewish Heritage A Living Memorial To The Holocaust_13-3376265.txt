Opened in 1997, the Museum of Jewish Heritage - A Living Memorial to the Holocaust honors those who died by celebrating their lives - cherishing the civilization that they built, their achievements and faith, their joys and hopes, and the vibrant Jewish community that is their legacy today. In the Museum's core exhibition, personal objects, photographs, and original films illustrate the story of Jewish heritage in the twentieth century. In addition, the collection provides source materials for permanent and temporary exhibitions, and for traveling exhibitions. Special exhibitions afford the Museum the opportunity to complement the themes expressed in the core exhibition in greater detail.
