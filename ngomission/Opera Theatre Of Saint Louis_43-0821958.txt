Opera Theatre of Saint Louis (OTSL) was founded in the spring of 1976 by Richard Gaddes, with a small group of opera-lovers who were determined to bring festival-quality opera to the St. Louis area. Each spring, OTSL offers a festival season of quality productions sung in English by the best young American singers, all accompanied by members of the Saint Louis Symphony. Opera Theatre of Saint Louis has earned a reputation for artistic quality and a commitment to education and professional development programs. OTSL is a local and national resource for talent at all levels, with interrelated education programs, apprenticeships, community events and professional training programs.
