The mission of the Virginia Aquarium & Marine Science Center Foundation is to increase the public's knowledge and appreciation of Virginia's marine environment and inspire commitment to preserve its existence. We do this through our whale and dolphin watch programs; marine science education outreach; the Ocean In Motion Chesapeake Bay Learning Lab; and programs and exhibits at the Museum. The Museum features over 700,000 gallons of one of the best aquariums and live animal habitats in the country. Visitors can experience hundreds of hands-on exhibits, outdoor aviary, nature trail, marshlands, and a 3D IMAX Theater.
