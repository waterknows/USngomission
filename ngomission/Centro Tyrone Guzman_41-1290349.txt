Centro is a partnership with Latino and Chicano families. Centro is a place where we offer respite from troubles, understanding to solve crises, education and encouragement to make change, nurturing and healing to strengthen families, art and culture to reaffirm our identity and value, and resources to build a better future. We envision a vibrant, diverse and inclusive Latin community that belongs and contributes to the social and economic vitality of Minnesota.
