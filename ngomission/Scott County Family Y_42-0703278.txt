The Scott County Family Y has served the Quad Cities since 1858. Our mission is to put Judeo-Christian principles into practice through programs that build healthy spirit, mind and body for all. We provide programs and services to assist each individual to overcome their most immediate obstacle to reach their God given potential. We accomplish our mission by demonstrating and teaching the character traits of caring, honesty, respect, and responsibility. Efforts to fulfill our mission are evident in the programs and services we provide via our YMCA Camp Abe Lincoln, YMCA childcare services and our four YMCA facilities: Davenport Family YMCA, North Family YMCA, West Family YMCA and Bettendorf Family YMCA.
