Junior Achievement of Tampa Bay serves 12 counties including the entire Tampa Bay Area. Junior Achievement is a volunteer driven, non-profit organization. This year more than 3,100 business professionals, parents, retirees and college students will enter our schools to teach Junior Achievement programs. These volunteers use their personal experiences to make the Junior Achievement curricula practical and realistic. Providing children with positive adult role models, who illustrate ways to build self-confidence, develop skills and find avenues of success in our free enterprise system, is a hallmark of Junior Achievement.
