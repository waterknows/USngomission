Rowan Helping Ministries is a continuation of Rowan Cooperative Christian Ministry, a ministry begun in 1967 by several of Salisbury's downtown churches. Our programs include: the Overnight Shelter, Soup Kitchen, Clothing Center, Food Pantry, Crisis Assistance Network, Transitional Housing Programs, Rowan Helping Ministries-West, and New Tomorrows. We have a full-time staff of nineteen and a part-time staff of twelve. We rely on 30-35 volunteers daily, and without them, Rowan Helping Ministries wouldn't be possible.
