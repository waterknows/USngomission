The Readers Are Leaders Foundation was founded in 1999 by The Houston Chronicle to promote newspapers as effective tools for improving the academic skills of young people in the Greater Houston, Texas area. The Foundation has a two-fold purpose: to encourage schoolchildren to read, and to foster a better understanding of current events and world affairs by these children. Programs include the Adopt-a-class program, which provides free newspaper subscriptions and a variety of teaching guides to needy classrooms; the Family-based Literacy program, providing educational assistance to students and family of 47 inner-city school communities in the Houston area; and Club Chronicle, where children and adults can improve their reading skills by reading serial stories.
