Founded in 1971, New Hope International works to build bridges, mobilize churches, and to win the next generation for Christ. As members of God's family, reconciled by the cross, New Hope wants to contribute to the unity within the Church. New Hope works across denominations and seeks to build bridges and partner with specialized ministries and churches of like mind. New Hope focuses on national churches in each country, equipping them for ministry. It goes one step further and also seeks to mobilize them, getting them involved hands-on. New Hope's focus is the next generation, which involves children, youth and families. We have currently placed over 300 orphan's into Christian homes and provide them with ongoing support. More than seeking large numbers reached or commitments, New Hope's emphasis, like the apostle Paul's, is to win them.
