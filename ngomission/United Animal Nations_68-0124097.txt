RedRover brings animals from crisis to care and strengthens the bond between people and animals through the following programs:



-	RedRover Responders. Our volunteer team shelters and cares for animals displaced by natural disasters and reconnects them to owners. We also shelter and care for animals rescued from puppy mills, hoarding cases and other significant abuse situations. (Formerly Emergency Animal Rescue Service)

 

-	RedRover Readers. We help children explore the bond between people and animals through stories and discussion. (Formerly Humane Education Ambassador Readers)

 

-	RedRover Relief. We provide guidance and financial assistance to help pet owners, Good Samaritans and animal rescuers obtain urgent veterinary care. (Formerly LifeLine Grant Program)



-	RedRover Reporters. We encourage people to watch for and report situations of abuse and neglect. We offer financial incentives to encourage witnesses of animal cruelty to come forward.
