Western Center on Law & Poverty leads the fight in the court, counties and capital to secure housing, healthcare and a strong safety net for low-income Californians. Western Center opened its doors in 1967 in the midst of the nation's "War on Poverty" as a joint legal clinic of USC, UCLA, and Loyola Law Schools. In 1996, Congress cut off federal financial support for programs like Western Center. Today Western Center's cutting edge advocacy, litigation and educational work are supported by private donations, foundation grants, and attorney fee awards. Western Center receives no federal funding.
