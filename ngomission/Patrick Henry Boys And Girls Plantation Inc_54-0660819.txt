Patrick Henry Boys and Girls Plantation is a unique, Christian, residential child-care ministry for boys and girls between the ages of 6 and 17. Our purpose is to offer a haven for children from turbulent domestic situations. We focus on prevention, and reach out to disadvantaged children before they are scarred by neglect or abuse. We subscribe to the old adage that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and focus our resources on reaching children in the early stages of dysfunction, before the ill-effects of their troubled home-life can leave an indelible mark on their young lives. It is our mission to provide them with a high quality substitute home that meets their needs and is consistent with Christian values.
