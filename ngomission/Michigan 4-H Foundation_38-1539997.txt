Founded in 1952, The Michigan 4-H Foundation supports Michigan 4-H Youth Development to prepare youth for meaningful and productive lives. The Foundation accomplishes this by providing grants to state and local 4-H programs for the development of new youth development programs in Michigan communities, the training and development of adult and older teen volunteers, and to continue successful ongoing 4-H programming.
