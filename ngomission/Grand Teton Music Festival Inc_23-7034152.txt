Since its inception in 1962, the Grand Teton Music Festival (GTMF) has earned the reputation as one of the most vibrant summer music festivals in the country. Originally produced by an organization known as the Fine Arts Guild as part of the Jackson Hole Fine Arts Festival, the Grand Teton Music Festival's first several seasons included dance, film, and visual arts as well as music. Today, musicians from America's great orchestras and music school faculties gather annually to form a resident orchestra that performs weekly concerts of symphonic music, as well as chamber music, in the breathtaking setting of the Grand Tetons. In addition to the Festival's summer season and a series of winter concerts, year-round education and outreach programming (now including 12 Met Opera HD broadcasts) has become an integral part of the Festival's mission. These programs reach more than 20,000 young students, musicians, and adults each year.
