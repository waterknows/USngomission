The mission of the Chattanooga Symphony & Opera (CSO) is to inspire, engage, and enrich the greater Chattanooga community through music and music education. The CSO's community engagement and education programs strive to do just that. Our education programs send musicians into local schools and bring students to the Tivoli Theatre to inspire and encourage Chattanooga's students to love and appreciate classical music. Frequent collaborations with Chattanooga's cultural institutions and city organizations help to engage the community and further classical music and the arts. Performances in public venues, hospitals, and community celebrations enrich Chattanooga and contribute to a vibrant city.
