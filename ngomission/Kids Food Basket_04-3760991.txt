Kids' Food Basket is a force for "Attacking Childhood Hunger." Our mission is to ensure children in our community do not go to bed hungry. We began over ten years ago by serving 125 kids each school day through our Sack Supper program and now serve nearly 6,000 kids each day in greater Grand Rapids and Muskegon. Sack Suppers are evening meals that provide a well-rounded nutritious meal, nutrition that's critical to the development of kids' brains and bodies.
