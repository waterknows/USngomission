Alliance for Children Everywhere (ACE) was founded in 1969 under the name House of Samuel. Throughout our forty years of ministry our focus has been to enable Christians to demonstrate the great love of Jesus Christ by helping children in crisis. In Zambia Africa, ACE operates three rescue homes for abandoned infants, orphans and young children in crisis. We provide assistance to extended families, advocate for adoption, provide infant formula to babies at risk of abandonment or starvation, and offer free Christian education to children who cannot attend school due to family poverty.
