Council for a Strong America (CSA) is the umbrella nonprofit for five membership organizations comprising the unique and powerful voices of business, military, law enforcement, faith, and sports all working together to prepare young Americans for success. CSA serves as the corporate nonprofit for its membership organizations. Fight Crime: Invest in Kids was launched in 1996 followed by America's Edge (2008), Mission: Readiness (2009), Shepherding the Next Generation (2010) and Champions for America's Future (2013). Members of each CSA organization engage in a variety of activities including releasing research reports at press conferences, writing opinion pieces in the media and meeting with policy makers to educate them on effective investments that help children succeed.
