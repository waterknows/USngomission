Since the Minnesota Ovarian Cancer Alliance was founded in 1999, our mission has been to create an awareness regarding early warning signs that may be indicative of ovarian cancer; create and promote resources for support, networking and education for women diagnosed with ovarian cancer and their families; unite and educate individuals, the medical community and organizations to achieve earlier diagnosis, better treatment and a cure for ovarian cancer; advance ovarian cancer research toward earlier diagnosis, better treatment, and a cure.
