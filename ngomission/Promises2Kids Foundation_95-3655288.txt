Promises2Kids, originally founded as the Child Abuse Prevention Foundation in 1981, is a leading advocate in addressing the issues facing foster children in San Diego County. In the early nineties, the Foundation raised over $12 million to build the A.B. and Jessie Polinksy Children's Center, which is San Diego County's emergency shelter for abused and neglected children and protects over 1,000 children each year. Promises2Kids has since worked diligently and effectively to identify, fund, and implement approaches that meet specific needs of current and former San Diego foster youth. Through its programs and services, Promises2Kids is dedicated to its mission of Creating a Brighter Future for Foster Children. Promises2Kids focuses its resources on its core programs: Guardian Scholars, Camp Connect, the Polinsky Children's Center and Foster Funds.
