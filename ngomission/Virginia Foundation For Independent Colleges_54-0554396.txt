The mission of the Virginia Foundation for Independent Colleges is to advance the distinctive values and strengths of our fifteen smaller enrollment, undergraduate, residential Virginia member colleges. We do this by securing financial support from the private sector, increasing visibility, facilitating innovative and collaborative initiatives between the colleges, and supporting initiatives which ensure that this personalized educational experience remains an affordable choice for tomorrow's citizen-leaders.
