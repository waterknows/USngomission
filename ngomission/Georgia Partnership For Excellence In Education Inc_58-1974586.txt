The Georgia Partnership for Excellence in Education works to inform and influence Georgia leaders through research. We use non-partisan advocacy to impact education policies and practices for the improvement of student achievement. Founded in 1990 by the Georgia Chamber of Commerce and the Georgia Economic Developers Association, the Partnership consists of business, education, community and government leaders who share a vision of improved education. Working to be Georgia's foremost change agent in education, we take the lead in efforts to shape policy and reform education.
