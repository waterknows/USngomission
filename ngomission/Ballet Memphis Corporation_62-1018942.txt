Everyone Matters. For more than 25 years that's been the driving force behind our mission: Creating, presenting and teaching ballet and dance in many forms as we celebrate the human spirit through our bodies. It pushes us to reach further, providing culturally significant art to all who are willing to nourish it and to continue moving it forward, as well as nurturing young talent both on stage and in our community. It's helped redefine Memphis' cultural landscape and helped Ballet Memphis to evolve into a groundbreaking, nationally sought-after company.
