Special Olympics transforms lives through the joy of sport, every day, everywhere. We are the world's largest sports organization: with nearly 4 million athletes in more than 170 countries -- more than 16,500 athletes here in Missouri. We are also a global social movement. With initiatives to activate youth, engage individuals with intellectual disabilities, build communities, and improve the health of our athletes - we're changing the game for people young and old and asking you to be a part of it all.
