Established in 1973, International Disaster Emergency Service (IDES) brings glory to God by offering help and hope to our hurting world.I.D.E.S. seeks to meet the physical and spiritual needs of suffering people throughout the world in the name of Jesus.We work in partnership with Christian Churches / Churches of Christ in the U.S. and their missionaries overseas.Our projects fall into one of five "Focus Areas": Disaster assistance, Hunger relief, Medical care, Development, and Evangelism. Nearly all our projects touch on the priority of caring for the poor, the sick, the hungry and the homeless (see Matthew 25:31ff) . This is at the center of our mission and purpose.
