The mission of the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, WCCF or the Council, is to ensure that every child in Wisconsin grows up in a just and nurturing family and community. The Wisconsin Council on Children and Families was established in 1881 as the Wisconsin Conference on Charities and Corrections. For well over a century, the organization has focused on improving conditions for families and children through policy change, expanded public investments and public education that lead to improvements in outcomes and practices in the delivery of publicly funded health care, education, workforce development and social services.
