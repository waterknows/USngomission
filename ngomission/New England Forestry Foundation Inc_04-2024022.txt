Founded in 1944, the New England Forestry Foundation (NEFF) is dedicated to providing for the conservation and ecologically sound management of privately owned forestlands in New England, throughout the Americas and beyond. NEFF works to educate landowners, foresters, forest products industries, and the general public about the benefits of forest stewardship and multi-generational forestland planning; permanently protect forests through gifts and acquisitions of land for the benefit of future generations; actively manage Foundation lands as demonstration and educational forests; conserve a working landscape that supports economic welfare and quality of life; and support the development and implementation of forest policy and forest practices that encourage and sustain private ownership.
