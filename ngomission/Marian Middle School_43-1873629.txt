Founded in 2000, Marian Middle School is a Catholic school serving adolescent girls of all religious, racial, and ethnic backgrounds. We are committed to breaking the cycle of poverty by fostering girls' spiritual, academic, social, moral, emotional, and physical development in preparation for and for successful completion of college preparatory high schools.
