Founded in 2000, VillageReach works to save lives and improve health by increasing healthcare access and quality for remote, underserved communities. We partner with governments, businesses, nonprofits, and other organizations to improve the performance and reliability of health systems in the most inaccessible and isolated last mile communities. VillageReach's model improves access to healthcare by providing a logistics platform to facilitate delivery of medical supplies and by starting and managing social businesses to improve local infrastructure.
