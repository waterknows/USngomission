Fifth Avenue Committee, (FAC) is a community-based organization in lower Park Slope and South Brooklyn. We are neighbors working together for a vibrant, diverse community where all residents have genuine opportunities to achieve their goals, as well as the power to shape the community's future. FAC's mission is to advance social and economic justice in South Brooklyn. We develop and manage affordable housing and community facilities, create economic opportunities, organize residents and workers, offer student-centered adult education and combat displacement caused by gentrification.
