Founded in 1896, Huntington University (HU) is a Christ-centered liberal arts institution of higher education. With the conviction that all truth is God's truth, the University exists to carry out the mission of Christ in higher education. Through a curriculum of demonstrated academic excellence, students are educated in the liberal arts and their chosen disciplines, always seeking to examine the relationship between the disciplines and God's revelation in Jesus Christ. The University is committed to educating men and women to impact our world for Christ. To this end, the University dedicates itself to these three guiding principles: service for Christ and His creation, student-focused climate, and continuous process improvement.
