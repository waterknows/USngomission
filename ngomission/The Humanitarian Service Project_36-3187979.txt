The Humanitarian Service Project's purpose is to alleviate the pain and suffering that poverty brings to needy seniors and children living in DuPage and Kane Counties, Illinois, without distinction of gender, race, creed, caste, or color. Our Christmas offering project provides food, toys, and books for needy families and seniors in DuPage and Kane counties. Our senior citizen project provides year round food and assistance for needy seniors. We serve 121 seniors every month with approximately 100 pounds of food and goods. The children's birthday project gives birthday and Christmas presents and books to 1,200 needy children. The feed the kids program provides food for over 100 needy families during the summer break when children do not receive subsidized school lunches.
