The Chesapeake Bay Trust is a private grant making organization created to promote public awareness and participation in the restoration and protection of the Chesapeake Bay and its Maryland tributaries. Since its creation in 1985 by the Maryland General Assembly, the Trust has awarded more than $50 million in grants that have made a measurable impact in the Bay restoration effort. Whether it's a Bay education project for Maryland students or an innovative way to reduce storm water runoff, the Trust wants each and every Marylander to consider ways to do their part to improve the health of the Chesapeake Bay.
