African Enterprise (AE) was founded in 1961 by a South African, Michael Cassidy, with the express mission to evangelize the cities of Africa, through word and deed, in partnership with the Church. AE is a Christian interdenominational, multicultural ministry of evangelism; reconciliation; leadership development training; and relief and community development. Our scope is all of Africa. AE leaders are African nationals that work with local church and parachurch leaders to mobilize congregations in outreach to African cities. Sixteen or more strategic cities are being reached this way each year. AE's ultimate vision is to see an Africa of peace and justice through the spiritual renewal and transformed lives of thousands of people.
