Boys & Girls Clubs of King County inspires and enables all young people, especially those who need us most, to realize their full potential as productive, responsible, and caring citizens. We give kids a place to call their own, where they can have fun, get a hot meal, be creative, be a part of a team, get help with homework, or just hang out with friends. We offer safe, fun, inclusive, and inspiring places that kids and their families count on every day. Thirteen locations with open doors throughout King County create space for children and teens to learn, create, and attain their best in academics, athletics, and more.
