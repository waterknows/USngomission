Midwest Food Bank (MFB), a faith-based, non-denominational nonprofit 501 (c) (3) charitable organization, was started in 2003 when the Kieser family began providing food out of a building on their family farm. MFB began by serving about 10 food pantries in McLean County, IL. Today we serve over 900 organizations across the Midwest, South, and East Africa from six warehouse locations. The food given out each month reaches over 600,000 people. The amount of food we distribute has steadily grown over the years as we strive to fight hunger. We receive donated food from manufacturers, distributors, grocers, community and organizational food drives, and from individual donations of food & money. Today, we distribute $8.3 million in food each month.As a faith based organization, it is the mission of Midwest Food Bank to alleviate hunger and poverty by gathering and distributing food donations to not-for-profits and disaster sites without cost to the recipients.
