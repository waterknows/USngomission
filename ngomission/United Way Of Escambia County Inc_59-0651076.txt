Founded in 1944, the United Way of Escambia County brings together agencies, businesses, organizations, faith-based groups, government and individuals to focus on the community problems that matter most. We improve lives and build a strong, healthy community by strategically investing in quality programs, building partnerships, advocating for better policies, engaging people in our community and leveraging resources. We measure success not by dollars raised, but by lives improved and changed.
