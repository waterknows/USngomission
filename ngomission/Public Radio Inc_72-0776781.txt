WRKF informs and entertains its audience through local, national and international news and cultural programming. WRKF's 28,000-Watt signal reaches a 60-mile radius around Baton Rouge depending upon terrain. WRKF was the first community-licensed public radio station news, information and classical music station based in Baton Rouge. The station launched on January 18, 1980. Initial programming was typical for a community-based public radio station of that time and included classical music, jazz, folk, big-band standards, and NPR news. The studios were in a temporary building at the transmitter site on Frenchtown Road. In 1986, the station moved to its current location on Valley Creek Drive in the city.
