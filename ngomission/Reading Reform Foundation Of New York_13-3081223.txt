Founded in 1981, Reading Reform Foundation of New York has adhered to its original mission: to improve reading instruction. Our approach is based on the firm belief and the proven record that all children of any social or economic group can learn to read, write, and spell fluently and with comprehension, if well taught. Reading Reform Foundation graduate-level courses for classroom teachers examine the history and regularities of the English language, spelling and pronunciation. We also send skilled teaching consultants into the schools. These consultants provide training directly in the classroom and conduct individual conferences with the classroom teacher to supplement the classroom instruction. Finally, we reach out to parents through our in-school teacher training program as well as to parents in the community.
