Feed the Hunger (formerly New Directions International) is an evangelical mission organization that connects followers of Christ with strategic leaders domestically and overseas to help fulfill the Great Commission. We have a particular emphasis on Christian leaders who are seeking to meet the spiritual and physical hunger in the needy and lost. You also have a hunger in your heart to make a difference in peoples' lives, to make a difference for eternity. You can impact the lives of the hungry here in America and around the world by participating in food packing events called Pack-A-Thons, going on a domestic or overseas mission trip, and investing resources. This organization is a nonprofit. Contributions to it are fully tax deductible to the extent allowed by law. It is also a long-standing member of the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability (ECFA).
