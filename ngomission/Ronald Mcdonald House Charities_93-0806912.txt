Ronald McDonald House Charities of Oregon and Southwest Washington provides a "home away from home" for families with seriously ill children, and supports initiatives to improve pediatric health. During their visit, guests stay in comfortable and lovingly decorated private rooms where they can get a peaceful night's rest, knowing their child is close by. Volunteers arrive daily to offer support by greeting guests with a smile, cleaning, and cooking. By providing a setting in which families connect with other families, and children can meet other children going though a similar experience, our houses ease the isolation of what can be a stressful and frightening time.
