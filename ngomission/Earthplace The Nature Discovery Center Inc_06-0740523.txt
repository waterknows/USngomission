Earthplace works to educate the community about nature and the environment and ways of taking action to preserve, protect and enjoy nature and the environment. Founded in 1958, Earthplace maintains a 62 acre wildlife sanctuary with trails, exhibits an interactive natural history museum with wildlife dioramas, houses live wildlife for public viewing, and hosts many public nature programs and events. Other activities include a state-licensed preschool and summer camp, and the Harbor Watch/River Watch water quality testing program.
