Our mission is to advance philanthropy by: serving the charitable interests of donors, enabling increased charitable giving, and improving communities by being a permanent philanthropic resource for current and future needs. From 1984 to 2009, the Community Foundation grew from six charitable funds and assets of $1.1 million to more than 1,100 funds totaling $250 million. Although commingled as a lasting community resource, each fund has its own name and charitable purpose as defined by its donors. In 2009, these funds awarded 7,500 grants totaling $32 million to nonprofit organizations that improve the quality of life in the Louisville area and beyond.
