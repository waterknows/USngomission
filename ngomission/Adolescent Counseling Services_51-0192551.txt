Adolescent Counseling Services (ACS) empowers teens and their families in our community to realize their emotional and social potential through counseling and preventive education. From their beginning in 1975, collaboration has been a core value at ACS. This spirit of collaboration continues today, as ACS partners with public and private agencies to provide an integrated network of services for teens and families in the community. Over the past 36 years, ACS has helped over 35,000 teens and their families find their way through and beyond the challenging adolescent years.
