Reconciliation Outreach was founded in 1986 by Dorothy Moore as an outreach to inner city kids and has grown as a leader in urban services to men, women, and children and one of the largest providers of rehabilitative faith-based residential services in the city of Dallas. Our mission is to establish a strong viable community within the inner city of Dallas and to provide a safe, loving environment for healing lives, restoring families, individuals and at-risk children and youth to a productive lifestyle. Reconciliation Outreach provides services in Old East Dallas to the homeless, the addicted, the impoverished and working poor.
