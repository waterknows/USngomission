Founded by Theodore Roosevelt in 1887, the Boone and Crockett Club promotes guardianship and provident management of big game and associated wildlife in North America. We maintain the highest standards of fair chase and sportsmanship aim all aspects of big game hunting, in order that this resource of all the people may survive and prosper in its natural habitats. Consistent with this objective, the Club supports the use and enjoyment of our wildlife heritage to the fullest extent by this and future generations. The Club maintains the records of native North American Big Game as a vital conservation record in assessing the success of wildlife management programs. The Club also conducts habitat research and demonstrates innovative land management practices, as well as conservation education programs at our Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Ranch.
