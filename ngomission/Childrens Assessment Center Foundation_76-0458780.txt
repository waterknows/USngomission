The Children's Assessment Center Foundation is a functionally integrated supporting organization for the Children's Assessment Center (CAC). The CAC provides a safe haven to sexually abused children and their families - a place where they can receive the kind of care and treatment they so richly deserve. The CAC employs an extraordinarily effective, multi-disciplinary team approach in the prevention, assessment, investigation, referral for prosecution and treatment of child sexual abuse. The goal of the CAC is to promote the complete healing of child victims of sexual abuse and their families.
