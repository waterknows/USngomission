Bottom Line is dedicated to helping disadvantaged students get in to college, graduate from college, and go far in life. We achieve this mission by providing low-income and first-generation students with one-on-one guidance through the application process and during college. Since 1997, Bottom Line has addressed the low college graduation rates of at-risk urban youth. Our organization was founded on the belief that students need a mentor and a guide during the college application process and throughout college to succeed. By providing consistent one-on-one support, Bottom Line has helped thousands of low-income and first-generation students stay in college and complete their degrees
