The Parenting Center's mission is to provide family members and professionals with the tools, resources and services to build successful families. In 1974, The Junior League of Fort Worth formed the Tarrant County Child Abuse Task Force in response to the growing problem of child abuse and neglect in our community. The Parenting Center dedicates itself to the prevention of child abuse and neglect and is a leader in the field of parenting education and skills based training. We work from within the community, providing individuals, families, schools and others with the most complete family services of any agency in the region. The Parenting Center serves 14,000 to 18,000 clients each year, from all income levels and social groups, across Tarrant County and the surrounding area.
