Habitat for Humanity of Palm Beach County, an affiliate of Habitat for Humanity International, is dedicated to the elimination of sub-standard housing by building simple, safe, and affordable homes for working families, in partnership with God, our community volunteers, and local organizations. Habitat for Humanity of Palm Beach County was founded in 1986 by J.B. Bramuchi, a retired general contractor. Habitat for Humanity of Palm Beach County partners with families in need to build affordable homes together. Each Habitat partner family is required to invest a minimum of 500 sweat equity hours of their own labor into the construction of homes before being eligible to purchase their home utilizing a 30-year, no-profit, no-interest loan.
