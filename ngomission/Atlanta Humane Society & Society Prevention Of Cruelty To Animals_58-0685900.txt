The Atlanta Humane Society (AHS) is the oldest private charitable organization in Atlanta, founded in 1873. The AHS - an Atlanta pet adoption center with a proven track record of helping the city's homeless, abused, and neglected animals - offers many additional public-wide services, including a Canine Play Yard for potential adopters, spaying and neutering, dog training and educational programs, and a veterinary clinic. Unlike many other animal shelters around the country, the AHS never euthanizes because of space or time constraints. In 2008, the shelter provided care and adoption of over 7,300 animals, and the clinic accommodated nearly 7,000 medical cases/visits.
