The mission of Seeds of Hope Charitable Trust is to make the tremendous benefits of Catholic education available to economically disadvantaged children. Through tuition assistance grants, scholarships, vouchers, operating support, and grants for programs and technology, Seeds of Hope supports the Catholic elementary and high schools serving a low-income, high-minority population concentrated in the inner city of Denver.
