Feeding South Dakota is a hunger relief organization that is fighting daily to eliminate hunger in the state. Every single day, Feeding South Dakota provides food resources for an estimated 3,800 people in this state. We help feed over 38,000 families each month and our BackPack Program gives food every weekend to 4,389 kids who otherwise might go hungry. In 2011, Feeding South Dakota as a whole distributed nearly 12.2 million pounds of food in this fight against hunger.
