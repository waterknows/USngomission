Habitat for Humanity of Greater Chattanooga Area is a locally organized and governed nonprofit, ecumenical Christian housing organization that has been building simple, decent and affordable homes in Chattanooga, Tennessee, since 1986. Habitat for Humanity of Greater Chattanooga partners with volunteers and low income families to build affordable housing. The houses are sold to these families at no profit and with no interest. As part of its ministry, Habitat for Humanity of Greater Chattanooga also operates the ReStore, a building materials store featuring building materials and some home goods, at up to 50-75% off retail. Proceeds from the store support Habitat's ongoing work in the construction of more homes for people in need in our area.
