Founded in 1935, the Tony Award-winning Oregon Shakespeare Festival (OSF) is among the oldest and largest professional non-profit theatres in the nation. Each year OSF presents an eight-and-a-half-month season of eleven plays in three theatres plus numerous ancillary activities, and undertakes an extensive theatre education program. OSF presents more than 780 performances annually with attendance of approximately 400,000. Inspired by Shakespeare's work and the cultural richness of the United States, OSF reveals our collective humanity through illuminating interpretations of new and classic plays, deepened by the kaleidoscope of rotating repertory.
