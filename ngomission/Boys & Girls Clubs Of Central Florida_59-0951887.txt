Since 1944, Boys & Girls Clubs of Central Florida has helped inspire hope and opportunity in those who need it most - at-risk children in our local community. We provide safe places to learn and grow for nearly 13,000 children between the ages of 6 and 18 every year. At each of our 30 Clubs in Brevard, Orange, Osceola and Seminole counties, core youth development programs are offered to meet the diverse needs and interests of our members.
