Since 1982, Eagle Mount has been transforming the lives of people with disabilities and children with cancer. With the help and support of a generous community, Eagle Mount opens up a world of adventures-skiing, horseback riding, swimming, camping, rock climbing, kayaking, cycling, fishing, and more-that foster freedom, joy, strength, focus, and confidence. Set under the beauty of Montana's legendary big sky, Eagle Mount focuses on people's abilities, while gently supporting their disabilities.
