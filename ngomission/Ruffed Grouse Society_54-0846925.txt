Established in 1961, the Ruffed Grouse Society (RGS) is the one international wildlife conservation organization dedicated to promoting conditions suitable for ruffed grouse, American woodcock and related young-forest wildlife to sustain our sport hunting tradition and outdoor heritage. We fulfill that mission by: helping assure that the traditions of hunting are passed on; promoting the unwritten ethical code of behavior; informing sportsmen and women of the past, present and future of the sport; enhancing the environment for ruffed grouse, American woodcock, and other young-forest wildlife, both hunted and non-hunted; conducting and/or sponsoring research; sponsoring land management and land-owner education programs; and educating the public and legislative bodies about issues related to the conservation of wildlife species that depend on young forest habitats.
