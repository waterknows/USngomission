Founded in 1948, the mission of the Peninsula Jewish Community Center (PJCC) is to build a caring and connected community, develop leadership, and strengthen Jewish identity and values in a center with an environment that is welcoming to all people at every stage of life. We aim to build a caring and connected community, develop leadership and strengthen Jewish identity and values. The PJCC offers social, cultural, recreational and educational programs and services to the Peninsula community. Although primarily oriented to the Jewish community, membership to the PJCC is open to all regardless of religious or ethnic background.
