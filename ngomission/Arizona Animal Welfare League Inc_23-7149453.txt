Founded in 1971, Arizona Animal Welfare League & SPCA (AAWL/SPCA) is the state's oldest and largest no-kill shelter. We provide a full range of services to the community in an attempt to lower the euthanasia rate and increase the "live release" rate of animals in Arizona, a state which has one of the highest euthanasia rates in the country. Our shelter facilities provide a temporary home for nearly 5,000 dogs and cats every year, offering medical and behavioral treatment for those in need. The Mission of AAWL/SPCA is to create a world where there are no homeless dogs or cats. Our Vision is to be the community's leading source for pet adoptions, veterinary services, volunteer opportunities, humane education and expertise in animal welfare. We are a no-kill shelter in that we do not euthanize animals except for the rare occasion when it is in the best interest of the animal, usually from untreatable medical conditions. We are a registered 501c3 organization
