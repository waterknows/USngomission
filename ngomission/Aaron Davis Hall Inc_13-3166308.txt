Harlem Stage is a performing arts center that celebrates and perpetuates the unique and diverse artistic legacy of Harlem and the indelible impression it has made on American culture. We provide opportunity, commissioning and support for artists of color, make performances accessible to all audiences, and introduce children to the rich diversity, excitement and inspiration of the performing arts. Since 1983, Harlem Stage has been one of the nation's leading arts organizations devoted to the creation and development of new works by performing artists of color.
