The mission of the Jewish Federation of Greater Santa Barbara (JFGSB) is to create and advance a cohesive Santa Barbara Jewish community by promoting identification and connectedness to the Jewish community, generating mutual respect amongst Jews of different practices, promoting cooperative relationships among the Jewish organizations and promoting positive relationships between the Jewish community and the community at large. The SBJF strives, in all of its endeavors, to preserve and foster Judaism and hold fast to its values, particularly tzedaka (charity and justice) kol Y'israel areyvim zeh lazeh (all Israel must care for one another) and tikkun olam (healing the world).
