Established in Clark County, Nevada in 1991, Habitat for Humanity Las Vegas builds simple, decent, affordable single family homes in Clark County. We are building in most of the jurisdictions in the Las Vegas valley including the City of Las Vegas, the City of Henderson, the City of North Las Vegas and other locations within the Clark County. Each home is sold at no profit though a no-interest mortgage. Families are required to volunteer their labor to help build Habitat homes in order to qualify.
