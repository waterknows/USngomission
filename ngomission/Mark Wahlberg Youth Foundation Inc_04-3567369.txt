It is the mission of the Mark Wahlberg Youth Foundation to improve the quality of life for inner city youth through a working partnership with other youth organizations. Our goal is to remove and eliminate barriers that prevent youth from succeeding. Our mission is to assist youth in order to ensure that no child is limited or prevented from attaining their lifetime goal or dream due to financial circumstances. Through the Mark Wahlberg Youth Foundation, we will provide financial and community support to assist in making the dreams and ultimate potential of inner city youth become a reality.
