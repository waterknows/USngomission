Americans United for Separation of Church and State was founded in 1947 by a broad coalition of religious, educational and civic leaders. Americans United believes that all Americans have the constitutional right to practice the religion of their choice (or refrain from taking part in religion) as individual conscience dictates. We are dedicated to preserving the constitutional principle of church-state separation as the only way to ensure religious freedom for all Americans. Americans United advocates for church-state separation in the US Congress and state legislature, runs several projects to help and educate, challenges church-state violations in court, and engages with local activists.
