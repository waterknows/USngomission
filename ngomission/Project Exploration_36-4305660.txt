Project Exploration is a nationally recognized nonprofit science education and youth development organization whose mission is to make science and engineering accessible to traditionally overlooked communities, particularly minority youth and girls. Since 1999, Project Exploration has engaged Chicago Public School students in hands-on experiences with real science and real scientists, and has provided critical leadership in the national conversation about out-of-school time STEM education. Our student-centered approach promotes long-term relationships between students and scientists, and empowers youth to become active partners in their education by encouraging them to study science-related topics that they find interesting. There are no fees or academic prerequisites, and we strive to recruit students who are inquisitive and ambitious, but are not necessarily "straight-A" students.
