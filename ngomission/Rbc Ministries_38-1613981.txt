Founded in 1938, RBC Ministries teaches the Word of God so as to lead people of all nations to personal faith and maturity in Christ. This is accomplished through: Our Daily Bread, a devotional published monthly; daily bible teaching presented in a practical and understandable way through television, radio and literature; Soul Journey, a devotional booklet published monthly; and Our Daily Bread radio. Our mission is to make the life-changing wisdom of the Bible understandable and accessible to all. Our vision is to see people of all nations experiencing a personal relationship with Christ, growing to be more like Him, and serving in a local body of His family.
