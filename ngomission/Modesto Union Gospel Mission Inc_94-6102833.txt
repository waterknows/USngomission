Since 1948 the Modesto Gospel Mission has provided nutritious meals, warm beds, and a place of safety for thousands of poor and homeless men, women, boys and girls. The Mission's staff is committed to sharing the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and meeting the physical, spiritual, and emotional needs of every man, woman, boy and girl who comes to the Mission for help. Five meals are served every day of the year. The Mission shelters approximately 2,000 men, women, boys, and girls each year. Besides providing clothing for the men, women, and children who are sheltering with us, the Mission's Community Distribution Center is open for distribution of clothing and small household items to needy families. There are also various medical programs available at the Mission.
