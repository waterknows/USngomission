All Children's Hospital Foundation is dedicated to bringing health, hope and happiness to children through philanthropic and volunteer support for All Children's Hospital. The Foundation works with individual donors, charitable foundations and corporations to enhance medical services and programs, and to help care for children whose families could not otherwise afford to pay. Last year alone, All Children's provided approximately $100 million in unreimbursed care to children in need. Founded in 1926, All Children's has grown into a leading pediatric referral center that is dedicated to advancing treatment, education, research and advocacy in child health.
