For more than three decades, The Foodbank has served as the link for food relief in the Miami Valley. The Foodbank- the only one of its kind in the area - nourishes the hunger relief efforts of the community through the acquisition and distribution of food to the hungry throughout Montgomery, Greene and Preble counties. The Foodbank provides the infrastructure for nearly 100 member programs that serve as the charitable food relief network in the area. The Foodbank strives to provide healthy, nutritious meals to all individuals we serve. Although The Foodbank's mission is simple, making it happen is a great undertaking that grows larger every day. Countless individual volunteers help us organize food drives, help sort and distribute food to the needy and help us raise much needed funds. No other organization in the Miami Valley does what we do.
