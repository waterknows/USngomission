The Midwest Organic and Sustainable Education Service (MOSES) promotes organic and sustainable agriculture by providing the education, resources and expertise farmers need to succeed. MOSES educates farmers about specific farming practices through MOSES Organic Field Days. These on-farm events give farmers the chance to see firsthand how successful organic farmers manage their operations. Educating farmers about organic and sustainable production is the foundation of MOSES' work. The cornerstone of this foundation is the annual MOSES Organic Farming Conference, the country's largest conference on organic and sustainable farming.
