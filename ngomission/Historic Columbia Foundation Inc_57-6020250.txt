Founded in 1983, Historic Columbia is dedicated to preserving Columbia and Richland County's historic and cultural heritage. Historic Columbia's properties includes historic house museums (the Robert Mills House, Hampton-Preston Mansion, Mann-Simons Site, Modejska Monteith Simkins House, Seibels House and Garden, and the Woodrow Wilson Family Home) and more than 14 acres of landscaping featuring gardens that range from an expansive park-like setting with a formal garden to a traditional 19th-century swept yard.
