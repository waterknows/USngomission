From the American Bible Society's (ABS) founding in 1816, we have been focused on translation, publication and the distribution of Bibles to as many people as possible. Our mission today is to make the Bible available to every person in a language and format each can understand and afford, so all people may experience its life-changing message. ABS carries out its mission by: affirming the power of God to speak to every generation through the Holy Scriptures; providing translations of the Holy Scriptures that are faithful to the wording of the original language biblical texts; working in partnership with all Christian churches and Christian communities; producing materials that avoid endorsing or advocating any doctrinal positions; and utilizing appropriate communication tools that allow the Word of God to come alive in individual and public life.
