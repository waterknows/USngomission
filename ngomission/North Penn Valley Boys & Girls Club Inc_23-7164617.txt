The North Penn Valley Boys & Girls Club inspires and enables all young people, especially those who need us most, to reach their full potential as productive, caring, responsible citizens. Our programs are specifically designed to be developmentally appropriate for our members. The Boys & Girls Club runs over 50 programs for youth ages 6-18 at two full service locations: North Penn and Indian Valley and a satellite site in the Ambler Area.
