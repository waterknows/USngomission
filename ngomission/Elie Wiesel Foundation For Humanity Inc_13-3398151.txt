Elie Wiesel and his wife, Marion, established The Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity soon after he was awarded the 1986 Nobel Prize for Peace. The Foundation's mission, rooted in the memory of the Holocaust, is to combat indifference, intolerance and injustice through international dialogue and youth-focused programs that promote acceptance, understanding and equality. In addition to US-based high school essay contests, conferences and various awards, the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity has two educational centers in the State of Israel. These Beit Tzipora Centers focus on educating the Ethiopian-Jewish community and giving close to 1,000 Ethiopian-Israeli young people the opportunity to grow and participate fully in Israeli society.
