The Blue Bench (formerly RAAP) is metropolitan Denver's only comprehensive sexual assault prevention and support center. Since our founding in 1983 we've worked tirelessly to eliminate sexual assault and diminish the impact it has on individuals, their loved ones and our community. Our hope is to one day live in a world where sexual assault no longer exists; where there are no more victims, friends and families suffering in its wake. This is what inspires our efforts. And until that day comes, our work is not complete. Inspired by the courage of one another - as survivors, activists, advocates and community leaders, The Blue Bench has helped hundreds of thousands of Denver-area women and men find the courage to move from victim to survivor.
