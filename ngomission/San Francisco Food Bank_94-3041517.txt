The SF-Marin Food Bank plays a central role in the food assistance network in San Francisco and Marin, where one in four residents struggles to make ends meet. Families, seniors and individuals find critical support in the food we deliver to our 450 partnering organizations, including 240 weekly grocery pantries. Each week, our programs serve more than 147,000 people and this year we will distribute 46 million pounds of food -enough for 105,000 meals each day.Delivering sustenance is just the beginning. We're helping people achieve a lifetime of good health by providing nutritious foods - including an abundance of farm-fresh produce - and other vital resources such as nutrition education classes and pre-screening for food stamp benefits. The organization was incorporated in 1987 as the San Francisco Food Bank. In January 2011, the San Francisco Food Bank and Marin Food Bank merged to better serve our combined communities and we are doing business as the SF-Marin Food Bank.
