Eisenhower Fellowships engages emerging leaders from around the world to enhance their professional capabilities, broaden their contacts, deepen their perspectives, and unite them in a diverse, global community--a network where dialogue, understanding, and collaboration lead to a more prosperous, just, and peaceful world. Founded in 1953, Eisenhower Fellowships brings two groups of approximately 25 outstanding mid-career Fellows (aged 32-45) drawn from 49 different countries to the U.S. annually for an intensive, individually designed program in the fellows professional field. Fellows are identified by high-level in-country nominating committees and selected by a committee at Eisenhower Fellowships headquarters in Philadelphia.
