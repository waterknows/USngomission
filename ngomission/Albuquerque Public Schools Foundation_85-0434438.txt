The APS Education Foundation promotes private support of the Albuquerque Public School district and its students. In partnership with Albuquerque Public Schools, we promote and garner financial and in-kind resources to provide students with the opportunity to succeed. We also mobilize resources and develop community partnerships to support excellence in APS.
