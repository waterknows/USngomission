Founded in 1888, the Wichita Children's Home (WCH) today offers the only emergency, temporary residential shelter for children in their community. WCH is open 24/7 and serves children from birth to 22 years of age. The Home provides several programs, including the Street Outreach Services (SOS) and BRIDGES. SOS focuses on helping runaway and homeless children and provides presentations to middle and high school assemblies and distributes cards with emergency contact information. BRIDGES is a program that provides housing, counseling and education for 16 to 22 year olds. WCH also provides a safety zone for infants and toddlers in the Foster Care program.
