United Way of the Lowcountry focuses on addressing the underlying causes of community issues - why problems exist. United Way supports services and programs that are not just stop gap measures, but ultimately preventative ones that create real and lasting change by improving peoples' lives. Social issues are not limited to any one particular city or to one kind of family - they are everywhere. That's why United Way works throughout Beaufort and Jasper Counties to help build stronger communities. United Way is focused on the building blocks for a better life: nutrition, shelter, health, education, and income.
