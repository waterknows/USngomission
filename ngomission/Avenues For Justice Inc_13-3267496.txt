The Andrew Glover Youth Program provides an alternative to incarceration that works. The idea is simple. Instead of sending kids to jail, the court sends them to us. We work to intervene and reclaim young people from lives of crime; we provide an overloaded court system with a reliable alternative to incarceration for youths; and we make the Lower East Side and East Harlem safer for everyone. Andrew Glover Youth Program works directly with young people to help them understand, accept responsibility for, gain control of and direct their own lives in a positive, law abiding manner. Our two programs serve at-risk youth and youthful offenders where they need help the most: the streets where they live and the courts in which their futures are determined.
