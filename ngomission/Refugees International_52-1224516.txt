Refugees International (RI) advocates for lifesaving assistance and protection for displaced people and promotes solutions to displacement crises. RI was started in 1979 as a citizens' movement to protect Indochinese refugees. Since then, we have expanded to become the leading advocacy organization that provokes action from global leaders to resolve refugee crises. Each year, RI conducts 20 to 25 field missions to identify displaced people's needs for basic services such as food, water, health care, housing, access to education and protection from harm. Based on our field-based knowledge of humanitarian emergencies, we successfully challenge policy makers and aid agencies to improve the lives of displaced people around the world. Where there are needs, we witness what is lacking, we present solutions and we demand action.
