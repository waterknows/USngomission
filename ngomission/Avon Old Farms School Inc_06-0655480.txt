Avon Old Farms School is a student-centered school; its mission is the education of adolescent males. To this end, Avon seeks to create a structured and supportive environment advantageous to the intellectual and physical growth as well as the social and moral development of young men. Avon offers a thorough, straightforward, and structured program to students diverse in their academic abilities. In their efforts to succeed, all students are at once challenged and supported by faculty members who are consistently available to students for extra help outside the classroom. Avon believes that this approach, designed to nurture self-confidence and a healthy sense of self-worth, is excellent preparation for the demands and rigors of college.
