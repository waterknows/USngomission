Bet Tzedek- Hebrew for the "house of justice" was founded in 1974 as a one-night-a-week storefront community law office staffed by volunteers. Today, Bet Tzedek is one of the nation's premier legal services organizations, providing free assistance to more than 10,000 people of every racial and religious background at its headquarters in the Fairfax area and its office in North Hollywood and at more than 30 senior centers throughout Los Angeles County. Bet Tzedek makes a crucial difference in the lives of the most vulnerable members of the community. We believe that all of the groups in our wonderfully diverse society are strengthened when bridges are built that bring us together in a common, just cause.
