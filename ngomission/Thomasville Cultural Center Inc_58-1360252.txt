Thomasville Center for the Arts seeks to enrich the cultural and artistic life of south-central Georgia, and surrounding areas, through the presentation of significant educational programs and opportunities in the visual, performing, and literary arts. The Center strives to be all-inclusive in its wide and varied constituents. Thanks to our members, arts partners and sponsors, we are bringing creative resources together and keeping creativity alive in our community.
