We provide compassion & healthcare to a world of need using Jesus as our Guide. Our Project Teams and Permanent Centers are designed to bring the love of God and bring medical capacity to those we serve.Operating in over 23 countries around the world, MMI utilizes Permanent Centers, Residency Training, and International Teams to serve the less fortunate. Medical and Non-Medical Teams led by MMI's In-country Staff work to build capacity and medical infrastructure by optimizing the gifts that God has provided. MMI Teams are a part of an overall strategy that builds upon itself and increases its footprint with each strategic Program.We operate Residency Training Programs that take local medical professionals and increase their skill set and then partner with them when they return home to serve. Our focus is on the whole person and we don't just go do good work and leave. Our in-country staff is in position to provide assessment and follow-up for all of MMI initiatives.
