Since 1961, The Senior Source has served greater Dallas as the go-to nonprofit for aging services. We assist older adults at all income levels from the most active to the very frail. People come to us for help with job searches, nursing home advocacy, money management, volunteer opportunities and counseling on any aging issue. The mission of The Senior Source is to improve the quality of life of older adults in the greater Dallas area through protection, eldercare, advocacy, volunteerism, and employment services.
