Covenant House Washington (CHW) was established in May 1995 to address widespread problems of homelessness and poverty among teenagers and young adults. With an open intake philosophy, CHW readily embraces those youth who take the first step to change their lives. No youth in crisis is ever turned away. Our services are free and we have made conscientious efforts to assure that our services for youth are coordinated and meet high standards of quality. CHW partners with community members to identify and address complex and multi-faceted problems that affect the health and well being of children and youth. Our community focus compels us to stay close to those in greatest need.
