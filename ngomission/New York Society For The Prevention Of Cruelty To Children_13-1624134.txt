The mission of The NYSPCC is to respond to the complex needs of abused and neglected children, and those involved in their care, by providing best practice counseling, legal, and educational services. Through research, communications and training initiatives, we work to expand these programs to prevent abuse and help more children heal. The vision of The NYSPCC is for all children to be safe from abuse and neglect. The NYSPCC intends to accomplish this by establishing best practice primary, secondary, and tertiary child abuse and neglect prevention programs that serve the most complex and challenging cases.
