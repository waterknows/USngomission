The purpose of The Association for Firefighters & Paramedics (AFP) is to support the work of crucial burn centers, fund patient care, provide burn medical education and support injury prevention initiatives and community burn awareness programs. AFP believes it is our community duty to protect those who are most vulnerable and most at risk, contributing grants and gifts to burn victims and burn programs at hospitals throughout the United States for the purpose of treating burn patients. AFP's board directs much needed funds to help the survivors of catastrophic fires.
