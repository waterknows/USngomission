Founded jointly in 1994 by Haitians and Americans, the Lambi Fund of Haiti is a unique grassroots organization whose mission is to assist the popular, democratic movement in Haiti. Its goal is to help strengthen civil society in Haiti as a necessary foundation for democracy and development. The Lambi Fund never dictates to a community organization what should be done; through discussion and reflection, the peasants decide what is best for their community and present the project to the Lambi Fund for support. Lambi focuses its funding in five main project areas: sustainable development, community micro-credit, animal husbandry, environment, and organizational and leadership thinking.
