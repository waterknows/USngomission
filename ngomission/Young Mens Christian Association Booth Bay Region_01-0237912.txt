The Boothbay Region YMCA, established in 1955, strengthens the Boothbay Region community through youth development, healthy living and social responsibility. Every day, we work side-by-side with our neighbors to make sure that everyone, regardless of age, income or background, has the opportunity to learn, grow and thrive. The Boothbay Region YMCA's mission is to strengthen Christian principles and the universal values of caring, honesty, respect and responsibility through programs that build a healthy spirit, mind and body.
