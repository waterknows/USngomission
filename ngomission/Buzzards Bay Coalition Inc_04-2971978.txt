Founded in 1987, The Buzzards Bay Coalition is a membership-supported organization dedicated to the restoration, protection and sustainable use and enjoyment of our irreplaceable Bay and its watershed. The Coalition works to improve the health of the Bay ecosystem for all through education, conservation, research and advocacy. The Coalition strives for a Bay shoreline defined by safe swimming beaches, open shellfish beds, and stretches of scenic spaces for all to enjoy; healthy waters that support abundant fish, shellfish, and wildlife populations; a Bay safe from the threats of oil spills, industrial and sewer discharges, and ocean dumping; and a watershed where rivers, streams, inland forests, and wetlands that buffer the Bay are protected.
