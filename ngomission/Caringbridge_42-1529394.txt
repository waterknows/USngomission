The mission of CaringBridge is to amplify the love, hope and compassion in the world, making each health journey easier. CaringBridge is a nonprofit dedicated to providing a space for people to rally their community of support during a health event. CaringBridge offers safe, private, ad-free websites where you can post health updates during any type of health event as well as organize help for a family in need. Friends and family visit your site to stay informed, leave supportive messages and sign up to lend a hand (meals, rides, caretaking, etc.). CaringBridge services are available to anyone, anywhere, at no cost. These free services are made possible by the generosity of donors and the support of volunteers within the CaringBridge community. Since 1997, there have been 21.7 million people who registered with CaringBridge and more than 530,000 sites created, with people visiting CaringBridge from 236 countries and territories.
