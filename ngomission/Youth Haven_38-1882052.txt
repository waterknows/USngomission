Founded in 1968, Youth Haven is a non-denominational Christian outreach with a single purpose of meeting the needs of disadvantaged youth - free of charge. With campuses in Michigan and Arizona, they have designed year-round on-site programs, Kids' Klub after school activities, Caring Clowns hospital outreach, and follow-up efforts to show hurting kids that God loves them, people care about them, and there is hope for the future!
