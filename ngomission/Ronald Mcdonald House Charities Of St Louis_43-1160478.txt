Ronald McDonald House Charities of St. Louis provides comfort, care, and lodging to families of seriously-ill children. These children, who live outside a 50 mile radius of St. Louis, are being treated at local area hospitals. In addition to the three Houses and the apartment complex, three local hospitals have a special place where any family can take respite, a Ronald McDonald Family Room. RMHC provides a warm, home-like atmosphere where families can eat, sleep, watch TV, or just relax, but most importantly, spend time with each other and with other families in similar situations. Since the St. Louis House first opened its first house 1981, over 30,000 families from all over the U.S. and several foreign countries have benefited from the services and hospitality of our volunteers and staff.
