In Touch Mission International (ITMI) is first and foremost an evangelistic mission dedicated to winning precious souls to Jesus Christ. Our primary target is the communist world, Islamic areas of the world, and other restricted-access countries. ITMI's strategy involves personal on-the-field witness and representation. ITMI partners with national Christians who face a variety of challenges as they reach their communities for Christ. In faith, we seek to present the ministries of these nationals to as many people as possible. ITMI supports church planting, building and provides tools for local national workers to use and thus improve the efficiency of their ministry for Christ.
