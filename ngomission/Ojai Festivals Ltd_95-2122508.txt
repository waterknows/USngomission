The Ojai Music Festival is a creative music laboratory which has nurtured many of the most important artists and composers to international prominence for over the past 60 years. Emerging and established artists of national and international reputation, programs highlighting works that are seldom performed in regular concert seasons, a passionate and culturally curious audience, and an enchanting outdoor venue combine to create an intimate and thought-provoking musical experience. The condensed four-day festival schedule offers both audiences and performers a unique opportunity for immersion in new music and groundbreaking artistic ideas. The Ojai Music Festival also leads the future of classical music off the stage through symposia, lectures, community events, and its Bravo! education program in the school.
