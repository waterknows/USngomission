EvanTell declares the gospel clearly and simply, activates believers around the world, and prepares upcoming generations to reach the lost. EvanTell is an international ministry with evangelism resources in more than 55 languages. Our ministry partners are in more than 15 countries, and our resources are used around the world wherever the gospel is declared. Our passion and concern is for the lost. We are called to partner with the Church and believers around the world to ensure that every person that has not trusted Christ has an opportunity to hear the gospel declared clearly and simply in their heart language. That's our focus and passion. We will do this until Jesus comes back.
