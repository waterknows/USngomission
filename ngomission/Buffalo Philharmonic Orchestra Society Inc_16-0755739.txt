The Grammy Award Winning Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra was founded in 1935 and makes its home at Kleinhans Music Hall, a National Historic Landmark with an international reputation as one of the finest concert halls in the United States. 



As Buffalo's cultural ambassador, the BPO has toured widely

across the United States and Canada including the recently completed Florida Friends Tour with JoAnn Falletta in March 2010.



Currently, the Orchestra presents more than one hundred and twenty Classics, Pops and Youth Concerts each year and the BPO Education department programs reach over 35,000 students per year (K-12) from all eight counties of Western New York.



During the tenure of current music director JoAnn Falletta, the BPO has rekindled its distinguished history of national broadcasts on American Public Media's Performance Today and recordings, including the release of eleven new CDs of a highly diverse repertoire on the NAXOS and Beau Fleuve labels.
