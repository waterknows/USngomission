Founded in 1986, the Atlanta Children's Shelter provides free, quality day care, emotional support, an educational curriculum for homeless children, and focused social services for their families. Dedicated to helping families overcome the issues that contribute to homelessness, including domestic violence and job loss, the Atlanta Children's Shelter focuses on the long term self sufficiency of the family - which sets us apart from other Atlanta homeless shelters. Since our opening, the Shelter has provided loving care for 8,000 homeless children and helped guide 5,000 homeless families to stable, self-sufficiency.
