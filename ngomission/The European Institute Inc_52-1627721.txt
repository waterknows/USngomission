The European Institute (EI) is the leading Washington-based public-policy organization devoted to transatlantic affairs. EI provides an independent forum for U.S. and European government and corporate decision makers, officials from multilateral organizations, foreign and economic policy analysts, and expert journalists to exchange information, develop innovative policy options, and create new professional working relationships. The Institute's role is to encourage the renewal of the transatlantic relationship to respond to new challenges and act as an early warning system and a mechanism for conflict resolution. EI's programs address cutting edge issues and bring together key constituencies in Europe and the United States.
