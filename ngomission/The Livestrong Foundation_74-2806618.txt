The Livestrong Foundation believes that unity is strength, knowledge is power and attitude is everything. Our programs, awareness events and advocacy work are the heart of what we do and our leaders and donors provide both the vision and the support for us to carry out our mission. Since 1997, we've been working to improve the lives of people affected by cancer. We started as a small group trying to raise money to fight this disease. As cancer has quietly become the world's leading cause of death, our work has expanded and now reaches every corner of the globe. We empower the cancer community to address the unmet needs of cancer survivors. To do so, we encourage collaboration, knowledge-sharing and partnership.
