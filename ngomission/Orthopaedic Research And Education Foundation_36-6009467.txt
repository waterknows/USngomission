In 1955, leaders of the major professional organizations in the specialty - the American Orthopaedic Association, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons and the Orthopaedic Research Society - established the Orthopaedic Research and Education Foundation (OREF) as a means of supporting research and building the scientific base of clinical practice. Since 1955, the Foundation has raised nearly $95 million and holds a unique place in American medicine. OREF is an independent organization that raises funds to support research and education on diseases and injuries of bones, joints, nerves, and muscles. OREF-funded research enhances clinical care, leading to improved health, increased activity, and a better quality of life for patients.
