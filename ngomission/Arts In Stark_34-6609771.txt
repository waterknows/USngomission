Although the name "ArtsinStark" has only been around since 2004, the foundation for what is now the county's arts council began in 1968 with the organization, and two years later, the building of the Cultural Center for the Arts. ArtsinStark awards grants, manages the Cultural Center and runs the Annual Arts Campaign. Nearly 80% of all dollars they raise through the Annual Arts Campaign go out to Stark County non-profit organizations, artists and schools in the form of grants.
