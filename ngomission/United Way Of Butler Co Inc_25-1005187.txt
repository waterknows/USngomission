United Way of Butler County is advancing the common good in our community. We bring together businesses; human service agencies; the faith-based community; and thousands of donors and volunteers who want to give, advocate, and volunteer in order to bring lasting change to Butler County.



These groups and individuals are especially concerned about education for our children and our workforce; financial stability for individuals and families; and about connecting people to the services they need, in the most efficient and effective way.
