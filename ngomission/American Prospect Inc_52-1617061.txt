The American Prospect is a respected and influential nonprofit media organization dedicated to improving the national conversation about the day's most important issues, informing and engaging the public, and inspiring smart, just policy. Since its 1990 launch, the Prospect has consistently published some of the most insightful progressive policy analysis in the country. Each magazine we print, and every day on Prospect.org, shows off what the Prospect does uniquely well: bridge the worlds of policy and politics with the lives of everyday Americans; connect and engage an audience of public intellectuals, activists, policy wonks, politicos, and informed citizens; and offer a vision of possibilities and aspiration to a new generation of progressives. Our print magazine with a reputation for incisive reporting and accessible long-form analysis, our continuously updated website, and three topical newsletters enable the Prospect to wield outsized influence in today's 24/7 news environment.
