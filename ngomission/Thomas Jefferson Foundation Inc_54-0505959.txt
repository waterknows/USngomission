The Thomas Jefferson Foundation operates Monticello, the home of the Nation's third president and author of the American Declaration of Independence as a living memorial to Thomas Jefferson's life, interests, and ideals. Founded in 1923, the Foundation supports its dual mission of preservation and education. Its facilities now include the house and gardens; the Robert H. Smith International Center for Jefferson Studies, home to the Jefferson Library; a museum shop; and the Thomas Jefferson Center for Historic Plants. The Monticello Visitors Center houses a permanent exhibition, a theater, a second museum shop, and the Foundation's Department of Education.
