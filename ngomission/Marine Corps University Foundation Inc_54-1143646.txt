For over 30 years, the Marine Corps University Foundation has harnessed the power of the private sector in support of the Marine Corps' most pressing educational needs. Our support has made professional military education more responsive to changes in the nature of conflict and brought a level of professionalism in faculty and diversity in perspective not attainable solely through appropriated government funding. Today, our enduring efforts to enrich & enhance professional military education focus on:

Strengthening the Marine Corps University's position of thought leadership in military studies & national security affairs;

Cultivating the problem-solving skills that enable Marines to think creatively & act decisively in uncertain environments; and

Developing the most knowledgeable, well-rounded, forward-thinking leaders â€¦ from Corporal to General.
