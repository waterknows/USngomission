Founded in 1846, Taylor University is a Christ-centered educational institution, and an evangelical, interdenominational covenant community committed to advancing life-long learning and ministering the redemptive love of Jesus Christ to a world in need. As a Christian community of students, faculty, staff, administration, and trustees committed to the Lordship of Jesus Christ, Taylor University offers post-secondary liberal arts and professional education based upon the conviction that all truth has its source in God. Taylor University carries out its mission and purposes through the operation of educational programs centered on two campuses: Taylor University Upland and Taylor University Fort Wayne.
