Emergency Family Assistance Association (EFAA) helps those in our community whose immediate needs for food, shelter and other basic necessities cannot adequately be met by other means, and supports their efforts toward financial stability or self-sufficiency. Working in cooperation with other human service organizations, schools, congregations and local police departments, EFAA serves as the hub of a coordinated network of helpers. EFAA provides food, financial assistance programs, emergency shelter and transitional housing programs. EFAA also reaches out directly to the community for help and support in their efforts through a variety of very successful volunteer and fund-raising programs.
