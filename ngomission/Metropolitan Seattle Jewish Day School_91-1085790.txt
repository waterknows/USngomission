The Jewish Day School of Metropolitan Seattle (JDS) was founded in 1980 by a small group of community leaders who longed to provide an intensive general and Judaic program. They wanted this type of whole child education to be delivered in a Jewish environment and made available to every child regardless of Jewish lineage. The Jewish Day School is committed to providing academic excellence through a rigorous and integrated curriculum of general and Judaic studies. We promote spiritual growth through the study of God, Torah and Israel; and prepare students to become inquiring, compassionate Jewish leaders in the community and the world. JDS serves 244 students in preschool through eighth grade.
