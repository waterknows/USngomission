Catholic Charities Health and Human Services helps people through 160 services at over 60 locations. The Catholic Charities Annual Appeal provides basic operating support through the generosity of donors from parishes all across the eight counties of the Diocese of Cleveland. With their help, we serve the hungry and homeless, children and families, the elderly and chronically ill, and people with disabilities. Catholic Charities Health and Human Services continues the mission of Jesus by providing vision and leadership for those who respond to the health and human needs and the social concerns of the people of the Diocese of Cleveland. We extend the reign of God in this time and place as we work with others to build a just and compassionate society that respects the dignity of every person.
