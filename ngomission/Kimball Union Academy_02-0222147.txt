The mission of Kimball Union Academy is to discover with each student the right path to academic mastery, to creativity and to responsibility. Rooted in the traditions of a New England preparatory school, Kimball Union offers its students an education that balances a challenging, dynamic curriculum with excellent programs in athletics and the arts. We seek to develop essential values: a love of learning, a respect for oneself and others, concern for the environment, and involvement in the greater world. We encourage students to discover their own strengths, to celebrate the accomplishments of others, and to engage with those around them. As members of a close and supportive community, the students, faculty and staff of the Academy are guided by principles of honesty, compassion, and mutual respect.
