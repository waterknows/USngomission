Founded in October, 2005, the unique concept of the Tulsa Symphony Orchestra (TSO) has gained national attention as a number of other professional orchestras search for a practical alternative to the traditional structure. The mission of TSO is to collaborate and resonate throughout the community as the professional orchestra that educates, entertains, inspires and distinguishes their community through musical excellence and innovation. TSO is committed to serving the Tulsa community as productive citizens, artists, teachers, facilitators, innovators, musical ambassadors and wherever their talents are needed.
