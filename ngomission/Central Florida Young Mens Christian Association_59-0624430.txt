At the Central Florida YMCA, we believe that our Family Centers are today's third places, and we know that the communities where our Family Centers exist are healthier and stronger because of it. We offer a variety of programs and services to our members and the community. Our programs are designed to promote the development of spirit, mind and body. They promote fitness, and positive values and behavior. The YMCA is a safe, positive place where families can bond and create new bonds with other people they meet at the YMCA. The YMCA came to Central Florida in 1887. Today, the Central Florida YMCA operates 27 YMCA Family Centers in Orange, Osceola, Seminole, Lake, Marion and Brevard counties.
