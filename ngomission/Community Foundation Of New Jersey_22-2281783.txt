Established in 1979, the Community Foundation of New Jersey is an alliance of families, businesses, and foundations that work together to create lasting differences in lives and communities - today and tomorrow. Donors who establish a charitable fund with us have the opportunity to focus charitable dollars on their timetable - on causes, organizations, and communities they believe in - to achieve their desired impact. The Community Foundation is a platform where ideas are implemented for good. We are a shared, cross-generational response of like-minded individuals to current challenges and future needs. We are a place where change takes hold, and giving becomes legacy.
