Pensacola Habitat for Humanity was established as an affiliate of Habitat for Humanity International in 1981. Pensacola Habitat is an ecumenical Christian organization committed to the elimination of poverty housing in Escambia and Santa Rosa Counties through the construction of decent, affordable homes. Habitat for Humanity offers a long-term solution, not a quick-fix, to the problem of poverty housing. The organization makes home ownership possible for people who would not otherwise qualify for a conventional mortgage or afford safe, decent shelter. In the process of building new homes, Habitat has cleaned up lots previously used for illegal dumping and has torn down dilapidated structures, making neighborhoods safer and cleaner.
