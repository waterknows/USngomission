Global AIDS Interfaith Alliance (GAIA) was founded in June 2000 in response to the global HIV/AIDS epidemic. GAIA provides basic health services, targeting prevention, care, and support in communities affected by HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria in Africa. We currently work in Malawi, a small country located in Sub-Saharan Africa at the epicenter of the global HIV/AIDS epidemic where 44,000 people die of AIDS-related illnesses each year and over 610,000 children have been orphaned because of the disease. In total, over one million of the 16 million people in Malawi are orphaned children.GAIA focuses on three main principles: Empowering Communities, Raising the Status of Women, and Building Healthcare Capacity. We implement these principles through the Nursing Scholarship Fund, the Elizabeth Taylor Mobile Health Clinics, and GAIA Villages (providing one-on-one care, education, and HIV prevention to rural villagers, especially orphans and those who are ill).
