Founded in 1981, Walker Cancer Research Institute (WCRI) works to find more effective treatments for cancer. Our Anticancer Drug Synthesis Laboratory is located in the state of Michigan, while our Natural Products Laboratory is strategically located in the state of Florida. Scientists in our labs in Michigan and Florida are working vigorously to find these treatments. We also provide educational information to the public concerning early detection of cancer symptoms and treatment options. WCRI's public information program includes regular informational letters to the public giving succinct information about the health risks and early warning signs of cancer. The National Breast Cancer Research Center is a project of Walker CRI.
