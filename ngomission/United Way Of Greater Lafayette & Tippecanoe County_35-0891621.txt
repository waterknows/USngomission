United Way of Greater Lafayette improves our community by focusing on education, income and health. We bring people, organizations and resources together to deliver results. You can give through our annual campaign, you can volunteer your time to a variety of worthwhile causes throughout our community, or you can advocate to create a better community for us all. United Way will add value to the Greater Lafayette community by enabling people to help one another. It will provide leadership in defining community needs and in coordinating resources to address community issues.
