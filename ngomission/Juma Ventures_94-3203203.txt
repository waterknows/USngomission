Juma Ventures provides a youth development program that combines employment in business enterprises we develop and operate, college and career services that expose youth to opportunities, financial education that promotes asset building and fiscal responsibility, and life skills that are crucial for future success. Juma fosters a supportive community in which positive peer and adult relationships create the platform for youth to overcome social barriers and achieve self-sufficiency. We seek to pioneer scalable, sustainable models that maximize impact with youth and in our field. Juma's mission is to break the cycle of poverty by paving the way to work, education, and financial capability for youth across America.
