United Way of Greater St. Louis, founded in 1922 as the Community Fund, brings people together to care for one another. We raise funds, mobilize volunteers, help to strengthen agencies, identify critical and unmet needs in the community, and help to build collaborations with the public and private sector to meet those needs. We help more than one million residents of the greater St. Louis area--16 counties in Missouri and Illinois. The United Way of Greater St. Louis unites people of different backgrounds and interests who work together to strengthen health and human services in Missouri and Illinois.
