Founded in 1972, Northern Plains Resource Council organizes Montana citizens to protect our water quality, family farms and ranches, and unique quality of life. We are a grassroots conservation and family agriculture group that gets the job done - protecting the Northern Plains and the people who make their home here. We protect Montana's water and land by educating and mobilizing local citizens. Northern Plains' affiliates and members know that good, clean water is essential to all life. Clean water and healthy land are vital for agriculture, recreation, and tourism. Additionally, Northern Plains believes that family-scale farms and ranches are better for our environment, our economy, and our communities than corporate agriculture.
