Hunger Free America (HFA) is a national nonprofit group building a bold, grassroots membership movement in all 50 states to enact the public policies necessary to end domestic hunger and ensure that all Americans have sufficient access to nutritious food. Founded as the New York City Coalition Against Hunger (NYCCAH), the organization was established in 1983 as the voice for the more than 1,200 charitable soup kitchens and food pantries that exist in New York City, as well as the 1.4 million low-income New Yorkers who don't have enough food. As it continues to strengthen its local efforts as Hunger Free New York City, HFA's local programs will continue to build upon it efforts to date. Hunger Free America is committed to meeting the immediate food needs of low-income Americans while promoting innovative solutions to help them move toward greater economic self-sufficiency.
