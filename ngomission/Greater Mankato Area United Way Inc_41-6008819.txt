Founded in 1931, the Greater Mankato Area United Way's mission is to unite the community to secure and invest resources to improve people's lives. By connecting people to resources and preventing problems, we help our entire community to thrive. Greater Mankato Area United Way's work is focused in three areas: Basic Needs, Education & Health. We identify the most critical needs in our community and then bring the people and resources together to develop the best solution. We unite the entire community's resources by conducting an annual fund drive, and then allocate those to best fulfill our local community needs. We allocate funds to 60 programs administered by 40 United Way partner agencies.
