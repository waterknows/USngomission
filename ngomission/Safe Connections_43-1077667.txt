Founded in 1976, Safe Connections is proud to be one of the St. Louis region's oldest and largest organizations working to prevent and end domestic and sexual violence while helping survivors reclaim their lives. Our services include prevention education, crisis intervention and counseling. Our counseling and support groups help women and teens; our Crisis Helpline is answered by someone who cares 24 hours a day, 365 days a year; and our educators visit schools and colleges, sharing skills for keeping relationships free from control and abuse.
