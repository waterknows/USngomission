The Little Sisters of the Assumption Family Health Service, founded in 1958, works with the people of East Harlem to address the physical, emotional, educational, and spiritual dimensions of family health. When LSA Family Health Service opened, its primary focus was on providing skilled nursing care to poor families in their own homes. Today, we offer a broad range of integrated health care, social service, education, early childhood development, advocacy and crisis counseling services to thousands of the most vulnerable families in East Harlem. Though our programs have evolved and expanded over the years, LSA's goal remains unchanged: to address the many dimensions of family health, and help at-risk families to be self-sustaining, contributing members of the community.
