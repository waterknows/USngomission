Our mission is to build self-sufficiency and prevent homelessness and hunger in our community by providing emergency assistance and enrichment programs. As a human service agency, NFCC is dedicated to preventing homelessness of individuals and families residing north of the Chattahoochee River in Fulton County (Alpharetta, Johns Creek, Milton, Mountain Park and Roswell)
