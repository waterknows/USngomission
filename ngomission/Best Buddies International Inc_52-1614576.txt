Best Buddies International is dedicated to establishing a global volunteer movement that creates opportunities for one-to-one friendships, integrated employment and leadership development for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). Founded in 1989 by Anthony Kennedy Shriver, Best Buddies is a vibrant, international organization that has grown from one original chapter to more than 2,000 college, high school and middle school campuses across the country and internationally. Our eight formal programs - Best Buddies Middle Schools, High Schools and Colleges, Best Buddies Citizens, e-Buddies, Best Buddies Jobs, Best Buddies Ambassadors and Best Buddies Promoters - will positively impact more than 400,000 individuals this year. Best Buddies created the 2020 Initiative in 2011, with the goal of opening offices in all 50 states, expanding into 100 countries, and impacting three million people with and without IDD worldwide by the end of 2020.
