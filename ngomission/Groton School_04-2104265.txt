Founded in 1884 by Rev. Endicott Peabody, Groton School's original aims included the intellectual, moral and physical development of its students in grades seven through twelve towards preparation for both college and the active work of life. Now a coeducational, primarily residential school of 181 girls and 172 boys in grades eight through twelve, we set for our students the highest standards of academic achievement, intellectual growth, ethical awareness and behavior, sportsmanship, athletic endeavor and service to others. Our mission has never been narrowly to prepare students for college, but rather always to provide an experience which, while academically rigorous, goes far beyond college requirements, addressing important personal aspects of growth and maturity.
