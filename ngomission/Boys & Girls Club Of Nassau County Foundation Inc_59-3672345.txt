The Boys & Girls Clubs of Nassau County Foundation was established to support the Boys & Girls Clubs of Northeast Florida's two Nassau County clubs. The mission of the Boys & Girls Club is to inspire and enable all young people, especially those who need us most, to realize their full potential as productive, responsible and caring citizens.
