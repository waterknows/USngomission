GOAL ensures that the poorest of the poor and the most vulnerable in our world and those affected by humanitarian crises have access to the fundamental needs and rights of life: food, water, shelter, medical attention and literacy. From its first year of operation in 1977, GOAL has spent over $750 million implementing relief and development programs in 50 countries. Once emergency situations have been resolved, GOAL implements a wide range of rehabilitation programs including primary healthcare, repair of home and infrastructure, clinics, schools etc., and water and sanitation. Long-term development programs in areas such as health, nutrition, education and capacity building of indigenous humanitarian organizations are also implemented.
