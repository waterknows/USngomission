Since 2001, the Center for Mission Mobilization has been working to engage, equip, and connect believers worldwide to their most strategic role in completing the Great Commission. Our mission is to point those who know and follow Jesus to those with no access to the gospel. We aim to rally the global church to work together in spreading God's glory to the ends of the earth.
