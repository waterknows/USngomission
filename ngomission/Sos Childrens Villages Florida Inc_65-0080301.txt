SOS Children's Villages - Florida offers our foster children the benefits of family life and a brighter future. Our village is a place where foster children come to live and grow with the nurturing and stability every child deserves. Since 1993, SOS has helped raised more than 450 boys and girls. Together we have pledged and fulfilled the promise of healing, hope and home for every child. Once a child turns 18, they are considered adults and are no longer part of foster care. However, that doesn't mean that they are no longer part of the SOS Family. Our SOS Next Steps program provides support and services to help our young adults continue to pursue their dreams and succeed on their own.
