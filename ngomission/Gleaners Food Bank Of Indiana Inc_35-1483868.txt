Gleaners Food Bank of Indiana, Inc. was founded in 1980. Ever since, we have grown as hunger has grown - fighting the crisis in central and southeastern Indiana every step of the way. Gleaners works to end hunger by engaging individuals and communities to provide food for people in need. We accomplish our mission by securing, storing and redistributing donated food to more than 350 charities, including food pantries, senior centers, shelters for battered women and children, homeless shelters, residential care centers, soup kitchens, faith-based nonprofits, and youth programs. Gleaners is grateful for the food and critical grocery items that come from more than 400 companies and organizations, and from hundreds of individuals.
