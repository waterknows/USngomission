For more than 60 years, Big Brothers Big Sisters of the Greater Chesapeake has operated under the belief that inherent in every child is the ability to succeed and thrive in life. As Maryland's largest donor and volunteer supported mentoring network, we make meaningful, monitored matches between adult volunteers (Bigs) and children (Littles), ages 6 through 18, in your local community. We develop positive relationships that have a direct and lasting effect on the lives of young people.
