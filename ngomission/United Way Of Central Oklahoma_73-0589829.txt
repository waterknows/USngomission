Founded in 1923, United Way of Central Oklahoma is creating lasting changes in people's lives right here in our community. No longer just a fundraising organization, today United Way is on the front lines of some of our community's most pressing problems. While providing critical funding to results-oriented programs at proven non-profit agencies will always be central to our work, increasingly we find ourselves called upon to address needs even more directly. From helping to write our community's disaster response plan, to addressing the startling number of high school dropouts, United Way stands ready. We harness the power of 50,000 local donors, thousands of volunteers, corporate and government partners, and outstanding non-profit Partner Agencies to meet the needs of 350,000 local people each year.
