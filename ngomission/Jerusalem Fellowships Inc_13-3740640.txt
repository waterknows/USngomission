Jerusalem Fellowships, established in 1985, is about Israel experiences for young adults, that create lasting bonds with their peers and offer a unique forum for engagement with Israel, Jewish wisdom, and their future families and communities. Over 20,000 people have participated in our cutting edge transformational Israel trips. There is a broad network of Israel trip organizers that have grown from the original Jerusalem Fellowships trips. These programs combine touring, active experiences, and dynamic Jewish learning, inspiring and enhancing personal growth for young adults from diverse backgrounds. Each organizer offers his/her own unique content, style and itineraries.
