The Center for Jewish History is one of the great public Jewish historical and cultural institutions in the world, and its mission is clear: to foster the creation and dissemination of Jewish knowledge and to make the historical and cultural record of the Jewish people readily accessible to scholars, students and the broad public. The Center serves the worldwide academic and general communities with combined holdings of approximately 100 million archival documents, a half million books, and thousands of photographs, artifacts, paintings, and textiles - the largest repository documenting the Jewish experience outside of Israel. This amalgamation of collections and public programs has brought over 100,000 visitors.
