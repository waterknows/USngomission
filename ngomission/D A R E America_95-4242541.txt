The D.A.R.E. (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) program was founded in 1983 by the Los Angeles Police Department, and quickly spread throughout the United States. The overwhelming success and demand for the program led to the creation of D.A.R.E. America. D.A.R.E. is a unique, reliable, and effective system of delivering science- and evidence-based learning to students, in kindergarten through 12th grade, about avoiding substance abuse and other high-risk behaviors, such as bullying and gangs. D.A.R.E. learning is conducted in schools, during class, by seasoned and specially trained law enforcement officers, who have the experience and stature to credibly teach D.A.R.E. curricula. D.A.R.E. is implemented in over 70% of the nation's school districts and in 43 countries around the world. D.A.R.E. is the largest youth drug prevention program in the world.
