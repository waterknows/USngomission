Founded in 1981, Human Life International (HLI) is the largest international pro-life organization in the world. HLI's mission is to create effective opposition to the culture of death around the world. In fulfilling this mission we strive to train, organize and equip pro-life leaders around the world. While we are completely faithful to the Holy Father and the Magisterium, we are also ecumenical and work with people of all faiths to advance the cause of life. We have worked in more than 100 countries around the world.
