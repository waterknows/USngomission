Ronald McDonald House Charities of Hawaii (RMHC-HI) was created in 1997 to expand the positive impact of Hawaii's Ronald McDonald House on the communities served. The House, which opened in 1987, has been and will always be RMHC-HI's cornerstone program. The mission of RMHC-HI is to provide a home-away-from-home for seriously ill children and their families and to develop programs and partnerships aimed at improving the lives of children in Hawaii and the Pacific. RMHC-HI operates three facilities to assist families that have children with serious health conditions. Two residential facilities are located on Oahu and the third facility is an in-hospital respite center - the Ronald McDonald House Family Room - which serves immediate family members of inpatient children at Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children.
