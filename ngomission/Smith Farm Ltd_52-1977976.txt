Smith Farm Center for Healing and the Arts develops and promotes healing practices that explore physical, emotional, and mental resources that lead to life-affirming changes for people affected by cancer. We offer empowering programs and activities for adult survivors and caregivers, as well as support and creative resources for the community at large through our Integrative Patient Navigation Services; Weeklong and One-Day Cancer Retreats; our Artist-In-Residence Program; exhibitions and lectures in The Joan Hisaoka Healing Arts Gallery; and our Community Resource Center at our U Street facility where we hold ongoing programs, classes, and workshops.
