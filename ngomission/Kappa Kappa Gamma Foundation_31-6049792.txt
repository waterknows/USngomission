The Kappa Kappa Gamma Foundation was established in 1989 by merging several pre-existing Kappa philanthropic funds into a single non-profit corporation, separate from the Fraternity, exclusively for the administration of funds for charitable and educational purposes. Program areas include scholarships, the Rose McGill Fund, educational and leadership programming, and museums such as The Heritage Museum in Columbus, Ohio, and The Stewart House Museum in Monmouth, Illinois. The Foundation works to deliver educational and leadership training, preserve the Fraternity's heritage from an historical perspective, provide scholarships and offer financial assistance to members in need by developing the financial resources to support these programs.
