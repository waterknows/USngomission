The Boys & Girls Club of Mercer County provides young people, ages five to 18, in Trenton and surrounding communities with safe havens, academic enrichment, and recreational activities through after-school, weekend, and summer programs. More than 2,300 youths in the Greater Mercer County area attend programs at our Clubhouse at 212 Centre Street and at seven public elementary schools in the city of Trenton. Teens from five area high schools enroll in Job Ready programs, complete paid internships, and prepare for post-graduate careers. More than 500 children and teens attend our summer camps.
