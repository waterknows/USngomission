Peaceful Valley Donkey Rescue is the largest donkey rescue in the United States with facilities located all across the country. Peaceful Valley is dedicated to improving the plight of the American Donkey through rescue, safe capture, sanctuary and education. Peaceful Valley is home to hundreds of abused, neglected domestic donkeys that have suffered terrible things at the hands of cruel owners. We are also the country's leading animal rescue facility in the safe capture and removal of wild burros under threat of destruction. At the Peaceful Valley Donkey Rescue, we go beyond simply caring for our donkeys. We provide resources and training to donkey owners around the world. We hold clinics, seminars and perform fieldwork in areas otherwise neglected.
