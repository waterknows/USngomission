Founded in 1918, United Way of Central Indiana helps sustain vital human services for those who need help most while reducing such needs for future generations. We help improve lives and build stronger communities through our support of innovative, practical and efficient human services programs and partners that address local needs. We assess community conditions and bring together the best resources in Central Indiana in order to provide help where it's needed most. United Way of Central Indiana supports the entire community, providing solutions that address today's needs and reduce tomorrow's. Our community priorities are sustaining vital human services for those who need help most, and helping kids enter school ready to learn and graduate ready to earn.
