Jeremiah Program is a nationally recognized nonprofit organization whose proven, holistic approach transforms families from poverty to prosperity two generations at a time. Through support for a career-track college education, quality early childhood education, safe and affordable housing, and empowerment and life skills training, Jeremiah Program prepares determined single mothers to excel in the workforce, readies their children to succeed in school, and reduces generational dependence on public assistance.Jeremiah Program currently has two fully operational sites-in Minneapolis and St. Paul-that serve 300 women and children annually. Phase 1 of a campus in Austin, TX, housing four families, opened in fall 2013; ground will be broken on a permanent campus in phase 2 in 2015. In addition, Jeremiah launched two pilot programs with Endicott College in Boston in fall 2014, and leaders in Fargo-Moorhead are making progress in establishing a campus in their community.
