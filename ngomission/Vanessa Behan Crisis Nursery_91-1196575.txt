Founded in 1987, the Vanessa Behan Crisis Nursery provides immediate refuge for children and support to strengthen families. We help parents who are having difficulty providing safe shelter and care for their children. Our primary services are 24-hour child care for infants and children under the age of seven, parent education, crisis counseling for parents, and referrals to other community agencies.
