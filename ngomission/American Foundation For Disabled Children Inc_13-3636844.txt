Founded in 1991, the American Foundation for Disabled Children works to encourage and maximize the development, productively, dignity and social interaction of challenged and disadvantaged children within society at large. Our programs include: resources for homeless and challenged children; Braille and large print books for the visually challenged; and camps and outdoor experiences.
