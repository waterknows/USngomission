Founded in 1791, the Albany Institute of History & Art (AIHA), one of the oldest museums in the United States, is dedicated to collecting, preserving, interpreting and promoting interest in the history, art and culture of Albany and the Upper Hudson Valley. The museum achieves this mission through its collections, exhibitions, education programs, library, research projects, publications and other programs offered to the general public. The holdings of the AIHA form the best collection in the United States documenting the life and culture of the Upper Hudson Valley region from the late 17th century to the present. The majority of the objects in the collections were either made in the Albany area or New York State, or were used and owned by documented families living in the Hudson Valley region.
