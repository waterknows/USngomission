Since 1946, the Guide Dog Foundation for the Blind has provided guide dogs free of charge to blind people who seek enhanced mobility and independence. Our students come to us from all over the United States and many foreign countries. Our trademark small classes and individualized instruction often attract students who may have special requirements. We have successfully trained hearing-impaired blind people as well as many physically challenged people. In addition to providing Second Sight through the use of our guide dogs, the Guide Dog Foundation offers extensive public education vehicles to broaden society's understanding of vision, visual impairment, blindness, and disability rights.
