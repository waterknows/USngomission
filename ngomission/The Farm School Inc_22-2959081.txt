Since The Farm School first began providing practical farm training for adults, its Learn to Farm program has graduated over 100 students into lives enriched by agriculture. Outside of one's own family farm, there really is no other place that comes close to The Farm School in providing training in the myriad of skills needed to operate an economically viable small farm. Forestry, animal husbandry, carpentry, mechanics, business planning and marketing join organic vegetable production at the center of the year-long program. Here, every day and in every way, students learn to farm by farming. Growing food for a 175 member CSA, a vibrant Farmers' Market and a 50 member meat and egg CSA and managing 150 acres of productive forest land is the core of life and learning on the farm.
