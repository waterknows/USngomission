The mission of The Ronald McDonald House of Long Island is to give comfort and shelter to families experiencing the pain of having a sick child in local hospital facilities. A home away from home, the House provides the parents and siblings of these children with a temporary haven in a secure and comfortable environment among other families sharing a similar burden. Located on the campus of the Cohen Children's Medical Center (Formerly Schneider Children's Hospital), the House accommodates families in a warm and supportive environment. Since opening in 1986, approximately 15,000 families from the United States and more than 80 countries around the world have been served. Many of the families are from Queens, Suffolk and Nassau Counties, as well as the surrounding Metropolitan area.
