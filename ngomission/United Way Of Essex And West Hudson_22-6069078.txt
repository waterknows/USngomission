United Way of Essex and West Hudson (UWEWH), founded in 1923, seeks to address the root causes of community concerns by aligning resources to best meet the needs of individuals, children and families through its service-area. United Way is working to advance the common good by focusing on education, income and health. These are the building blocks for a good life - a quality education that leads to a stable job, enough income to support a family through retirement, and good health. We serve a population of nearly 700,000 in thirteen communities in Essex and Hudson County.
