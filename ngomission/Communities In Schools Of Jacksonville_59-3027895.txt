Communities In Schools (CIS) was founded in 1977 in New York to help adolescents stay in school and graduate from high school. Communities In Schools of Jacksonville grew out of the concerns of community leaders about the high social and financial costs related to the problem of dropouts in the local school system. Since its inception in 1990, Communities In Schools of Jacksonville has grown from one site at Jefferson Davis Middle School to serving more than 35 schools and reaching nearly 7,000 students annually through case management, after-school, mentoring, and literacy tutoring programs. Communities In Schools of Jacksonville is unique in its ability to link valuable resources with those students in danger of falling through the cracks, enabling them to successfully learn, stay in school and prepare for life.
