The Gulf Coast Humane Society is an animal welfare organization serving Southwest Florida for more than 60 years. Our mission is to provide humane care for surrendered animals by offering refuge, providing medical care, and facilitating an adoptive home. Each year we take in more than 1,000 animals in need of compassionate care. As a no-kill facility, the pets of the Gulf Coast Humane Society remain in our care until they find their Forever Home.
