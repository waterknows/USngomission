Adopt-A-Family was founded in 1983 by three Palm Beach County women who recognized the need to help families who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless due to a financial reversal, illness, divorce, death or other extenuating circumstances. The organization serves residents in Palm Beach County who meet any of the following criteria: homeless children and their families; lower income, working families in search of affordable housing opportunities; working poor who do not earn enough to support their families and are at risk of becoming homeless; and families in a short-term situational crisis putting them at risk of homelessness.
