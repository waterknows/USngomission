The Santa Barbara Museum of Art's (SBMA) mission is to integrate art into the lives of people. We believe in the power of art to ignite imagination, stimulate thought, and generate experiences that are personally rewarding. Since its founding in 1941, SBMA has developed a unique identity. Influenced by the community as a whole and by individual collectors of major importance, the holdings of the Museum have taken on a character specific to this institution. SBMA's strong education and outreach program is multi-faceted: docent-led tours for children and adults, classroom slide talks, family days at the Museum, teacher workshops, lectures, adult education classes, and studio art classes for all ages at the Ridley-Tree Education Center at McCormick House.
