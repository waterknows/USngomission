Opened in 1954 as the Dallas Rescue Mission, the Dallas Life Foundation is designed to meet the needs of homeless men, women, children and families in the Dallas metropolis. For over 50 years now we have had a profound impact on thousands of people as we reach out with kind, compassionate Christian love toward those in desperate need. Dallas Life Foundation has developed a series of programs designed to help those assisted to return to a productive role in society. Each program targets a different group of Dallas Life Foundation residents. Programs are available to each resident once a referral has been made through our intake case management staff.
