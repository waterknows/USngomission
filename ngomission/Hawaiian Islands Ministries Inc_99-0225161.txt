Hawaiian Islands Ministries (HIM) equips, embraces, emboldens, and encourages men, women and youth toward Christian transformation, unity, and lives that make a difference now and for eternity. HIM's ministry lives in those we serve. Alongside basics like prayer, worship, discipleship, and evangelism, HIM addresses hard issues like school violence, sexuality, poverty, and addictions. Leaders have been pulled back from burn-out, and new ministries birthed. Adults and youth have heard God's call, taking the unlimited resources of Jesus Christ to the homeless in Hawaii, the AIDS stricken in Africa, and the abandoned in Asia.
