Founded in 1964, Lutheran Bible Translators (LBT) is an independent mission organization dedicated to helping bring people to faith in Jesus Christ by making the Word of God available to those who do not yet have it in the language of their hearts. There are more than 6,900 different languages spoken in the world. More than 4,500, or 66%, still have no portion of Scripture translated. LBT believes that no language or cultural barrier should prevent people from having access to God's Word. That is why LBT works with Lutheran church bodies and Bible translation organizations worldwide-- so that every person has the opportunity to read, hear, and understand God's Good News in the language of their hearts.
