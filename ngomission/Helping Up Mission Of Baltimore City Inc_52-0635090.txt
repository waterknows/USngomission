Helping Up Mission provides hope to people experiencing homelessness, poverty or addiction by meeting their physical, psychological, social and spiritual needs.Since 1885, Helping Up Mission has been coming to the aid of men in the City of Baltimore and surrounding region. Those struggling with homelessness have been receiving the help they need to start a new life. Today, most of the men who come to us have a drug and/or alcohol addiction problem. We know that men battling homelessness and/or addictions can get well if he gets the right kind of help. This is what the Mission's Spiritual Recovery Program is all about. At Helping Up Mission, we provide a vast array of services to an even more diverse group of men: providing over 1,200 meals each day, 182.500 nights of shelter, over 175,000 pieces of clothing and toiletries distributed annually, and 2,750 chapel services and educational classes conducted each year.
