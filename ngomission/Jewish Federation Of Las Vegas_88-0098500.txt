The Jewish Federation of Las Vegas represents the voice of the organized Jewish community. Bound together by shared history, traditions, and common values, it seeks to assure Jewish continuity in Las Vegas, in Israel, and around the world by preserving, strengthening, and enhancing Jewish life and transmitting these values to succeeding generations. The Federation is the central coordinating body for fundraising, planning, allocations, and communal services for the Jewish community. A well-established and widely-regarded humanitarian organization, the Federation has served the Las Vegas community for the last three decades and has raised nearly $45 million to support Jewish causes here in Las Vegas, in Israel and in 59 countries around the world.
