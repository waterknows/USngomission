Founded in 1999 by Dr. Bill and Nancy Lascheid, the Neighborhood Health Clinic delivers quality medical care to low-income, working, but uninsured, Collier County adults, using a volunteer professional staff. We are committed to deliver these services in a caring, supportive environment that respects the dignity of each patient. Our services include: consultation with a physician; nurse educators, interpreters; all prescription medication issued onsite; monthly patient monitoring. In addition, eleven specialty clinics are held on a scheduled basis; we provide referrals to medical specialists; and patients have access to laboratory, x-rays, and surgery when prescribed.
