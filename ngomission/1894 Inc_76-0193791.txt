The Grand 1894 Opera House was founded in 1986 to sponsor and promote cultural and educational programs and other activities for the residents of Galveston and adjacent communities, and to maintain and preserve The Grand Opera House complex as a historic structure. One of the few remaining theatres of its era in Texas and listed in the National Register of Historic Places, The Grand provides cultural and education programs to the extraordinarily diverse community of the Houston, Galveston, and Gulf Coast area. The Grand presents professional touring productions which include dance, theatre, opera, comedy and musicals, as well as 30 student and family programs throughout the year by professional touring companies, including outreach to the schools.
