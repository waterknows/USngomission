The Dumb Friends League is committed to the welfare of animals: we shall provide shelter and care for animals; we shall provide programs and services that enhance the bond between animals and people; and we shall be advocates for animals, speaking for those who cannot speak for themselves.Founded in 1910, the Dumb Friends League is a national leader in providing humane care to lost and abandoned pets, adopting pets to new homes, helping pets stay in homes, educating pet owners and the public, and rescuing sick, injured and abused animals. Beginning in FY 2012, the League began receiving abused and neglected horses that are removed from owners by law enforcement agencies, offering them rehabilitation, training and adoption opportunities. The largest independent, community-based animal welfare organization in the Rocky Mountain region, it receives more than 24,000 animals a year.
