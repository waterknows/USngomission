RHI believes that social change to overcome systemic inequities begins with empowered youth. In partnership with community adults, we nurture young people in Red Hook to be inspired, resilient, and healthy, and to envision themselves as co-creators of their lives, community and society. RHI has three programs that we have strategically designed to support young people through their middle school, high school, and young adult years. Our fourth program focuses on building a healthy and sustainable Red Hook community. We envision a Red Hook where all young people can pursue their dreams and grow into independent adults who contribute to their families and community.
