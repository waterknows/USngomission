Volunteers for Inter-American Development Assistance (VIDA) has been serving underprivileged communities in Latin America since 1992 by providing them with medicines, medical supplies and equipment donated to us by San Francisco Bay Area hospitals, clinics and individuals. Through such donations we helped to provide care for over two million people in under-served communities throughout 12 Latin American and Caribbean countries. In partnership with other US-based humanitarian non-profits, to date we have shipped over 290 ocean containers of medical relief worth over $210 million.
