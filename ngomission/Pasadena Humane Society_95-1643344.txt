The Pasadena Humane Society & SPCA is an independent organization dedicated to the welfare of our animal friends since 1903. Each year we care for more than 10,000 animals from the seven cities we serve: Pasadena, South Pasadena, San Marino, La Canada/ Flintridge, Sierra Madre, Arcadia and Glendale. Our services include animal control, investigation of animal cruelty and neglect, licensing for La Canada and Arcadia, adoptions, pet behavior help and training classes, and humane education.
