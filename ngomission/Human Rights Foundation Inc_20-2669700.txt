The Human Rights Foundation (HRF) is a nonpartisan organization that promotes and protects human rights globally, with an expertise in the Americas. HRF unites people in the common cause of defending human rights and promoting liberal democracy. Our mission is to ensure that freedom is both preserved and promoted around the world. We seek, in particular, to sustain the struggle for liberty in those areas where it is presently under threat.
