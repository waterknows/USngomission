Hibiscus Children's Center's mission is to provide safety for abused, abandoned and neglected children through prevention programs, residential programs, shelter programs, and recovery programs. The Center was founded by LaVaugh Tilton in 1985. Over 25,500 children and families have been helped since Hibiscus opened its doors.
