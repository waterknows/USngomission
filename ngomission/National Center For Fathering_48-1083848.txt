The National Center for Fathering (Fathers.com) is a nonprofit educational organization that provides research-based training and resources for dads. Our goal is to reverse the cultural trend toward fatherlessness by helping every dad live out a commitment to love, coach and model for his own kids, encourage a fatherless child and engage with other dads.At Fathers.com, we believe every child needs a dad they can count on. The research is clear: children thrive when they have an involved father - someone who loves them, knows them, guides them, and helps them achieve their destiny. We inspire and equip men to be the involved fathers, grandfathers and father figures their children need.
