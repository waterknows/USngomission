Interfaith Worker Justice has been a leader in the fight for economic and worker justice in the United States since 1996. Our organizers work to mobilize people of faith and work advocates in support of economic justice and worker rights at the local, state and national levels. Today there are more than 70 affiliated organizations in the IWJ network. Our policy department is the nation's leading producer of interfaith resources and materials to help inspire and inform people on worker and economic justice issues. We are on the ground in D.C., working with partners and allies to influence the national conversation on our core issues: Wage theft, Jobs, Paid Sick Days and Workplace Standards, and protecting the right of workers to stick together in Labor Unions.
