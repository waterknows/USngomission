The Austin Humane Society (AHS) is the city's largest no-kill, non-profit pet adoption center dedicated to saving Austin's homeless cats and dogs, educating our community about responsible pet ownership and reducing pet overpopulation. Since its formation in 1952, AHS has been dedicated to re-homing orphaned cats and dogs and educating the community about responsible pet ownership through spaying and neutering. Each year, AHS adopts over 3,000 cats and dogs and receives over 32,000 visitors. AHS has a dedicated Board of Directors, advisors, staff and over 700 volunteers who work to socialize and provide companionship to all of our animals.
