The mission of the Denver Public Library Friends Foundation is to assist and support the Denver Public Library in the accomplishment of its goals and objectives, and to enhance the services of the Library that are funded by the City's budget through advocacy, activities and programs, fund raising, and the management of private monies raised by or donated to the Library or to the Friends Foundation. Working within our stated mission, the Friends have a long history of supporting the Library, stretching back to 1940. Our spirit of volunteerism and giving reaches across generations and touches the hearts of innumerable individuals throughout the Denver area and beyond.
