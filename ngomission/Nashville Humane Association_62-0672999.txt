The Nashville Humane Association (NHA) is one of the oldest service organizations in Nashville. The roots of NHA can be traced back to a society founded in 1887 to protect children from inhumane working conditions and draft horses from mistreatment. NHA was incorporated in 1946 to protect the well being of animals in Davidson County. Today, the NHA is committed to: promoting humane treatment of animals, finding good homes for stray or abandoned dogs and cats, educating the public about their responsibility to help control the pet population, and providing treatment and care to ensure the well being of animals in our community. Over 2,500 healthy and temperamentally sound animals are placed each year into loving homes.
