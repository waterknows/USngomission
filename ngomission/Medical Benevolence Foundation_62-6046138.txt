For over 40 years, the Medical Benevolence Foundation (MBF) has worked to provide hope and healing to those most in need. Working with our partners, MBF supports healing ministries in more than 100 hospitals and clinics throughout the world. Our work includes: providing crucial funds needed to give medical care to the needy; working with our partners to fill cargo containers with surplus donations of medical supplies and equipment; recruiting healthcare professionals and other volunteers to save lives in developing nations; and community health programs, helping to train indigenous healthcare workers and personnel, education programs on disease prevention and nutrition, and more.
