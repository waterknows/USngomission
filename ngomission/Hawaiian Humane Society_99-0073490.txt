The Hawaiian Humane Society's has been serving Hawaii since 1897. Our mission - promoting the human-animal bond and the humane treatment of all animals - is a joyful one full of challenges and opportunities. As an animal welfare organization, the Society is also very much a people business; supporting and promoting the human-animal bond, educating young and old, and working to find solutions to the challenges of a diverse and fast-growing community. With an open-door policy that welcomes all displaced creatures, animals, birds and fish, the Hawaiian Humane Society operates 365 days a year serving the island of Oahu. Centered in the heart of Honolulu, the location is a shelter for homeless animals, a rescue operation, a placement agency, an educational and advocacy organization and a pet care resource center.
