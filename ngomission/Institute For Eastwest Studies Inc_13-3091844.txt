Founded in 1980, the EastWest Institute (EWI) is a global, action-oriented, think-and-do tank that devises innovative solutions to pressing security concerns and mobilizes networks of individuals, institutions and nations to implement these solutions. We focus on the most pressing challenges facing global peace and security and forge collective action for a safer and better world. EWI tackles the toughest international problems by convening for discreet conversations for representatives of institutions and nations that do not normally cooperate; reframing issues to look for win-win solutions; and mobilizing networks of key individuals from both the public and private sectors.
