Thompson Island Outward Bound Education Center (TIOBEC) is a not-for-profit organization whose primary purpose is to provide adventurous and challenging experiential learning programs that inspire character development, compassion, community service, environmental responsibility and academic achievement for early adolescents from all communities of greater metropolitan Boston, and the institutions and adults who support them. Using the wilderness as a classroom, Outward Bound guides students through a journey of self-discovery. By combining learning-by-doing, adventure, challenge and fun within a diverse group of students, we set the stage for them to explore their possibilities as leaders, problem solvers, and responsible citizens of the world community.
