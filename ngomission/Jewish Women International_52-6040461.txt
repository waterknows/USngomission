Jewish Women International (JWI) was born in 1897 just as 19th century women were beginning to emerge from the home and into the public sphere. Over the decades, JWI has grown and evolved, as have Jewish women, into a strong, independent and influential force making significant contributions to contemporary life and committed to the pursuit of tikkun olam- repairing the world- locally, nationally and internationally. Our innovative programs, advocacy and philanthropic initiatives protect the fundamental rights of all girls and women to live in safe homes, thrive in healthy relationships, and realize the full potential of their personal strength.
