Chronic Disease Fund is a charitable organization that helps patients with chronic disease, cancer and other life-altering conditions obtain the life-saving medications they need. We assist patients throughout the United States who meet income qualification guidelines and have private insurance or a Medicare Part D plan but cannot afford the cost of their specialty therapeutics. Chronic Disease Fund currently supports patients with more than two dozen different diseases, including many types of cancer (breast, colorectal, lung cancer, and multiple myeloma), multiple sclerosis, asthma, and macular degeneration, to name a few. We are limited in the financial support we can provide for each disease, as it is based on the funding we raise each year through grants and contributions.
