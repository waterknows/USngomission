Joy of Music Program (JOMP) was founded in 1989 to help young children develop a life-long relationship with music, by giving them a joyful and solid musical foundation on which to build in a non-competitive environment. The school's offerings include private instrumental lessons, an exciting choice of classes, highly-regarded jazz and classical ensemble programs, and a vibrant Youth Orchestra and Sinfonietta. Whether you are a beginner or have been playing for many years, you will experience a musical kinship and spirit of community at JOMP that is affirming and energizing.
