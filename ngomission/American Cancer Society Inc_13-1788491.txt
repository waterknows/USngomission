Founded in 1913 by 15 well-known doctors and business leaders in New York City, the American Cancer Society (ACS) is the nationwide community-based voluntary health organization dedicated to eliminating cancer as a major health problem by preventing cancer, saving lives, and diminishing suffering from cancer, through research, education, advocacy, and service. The American Cancer Society is represented throughout the United States and has a presence in most communities. More than two million volunteers carry out the Society's mission of eliminating cancer and improving quality of life for those individuals facing the disease.
