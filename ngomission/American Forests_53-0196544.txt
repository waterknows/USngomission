American Forests is a world leader in planting trees for environmental restoration, a pioneer in the science and practice of urban forestry, and a primary communicator of the benefits of trees and forests. American Forests is the nation's oldest citizens' conservation organization. Citizens concerned about the waste and abuse of the nation's forests founded American Forests in 1875. Today, the organization's primary campaigns are Tree-Planting for Environmental Restoration and Reversing the National Urban Tree Deficit, which encourage people to improve rural, suburban, and urban ecosystems by planting and caring for trees that provide important environmental and economic benefits including pure water, clean air, and wildlife habitat.
