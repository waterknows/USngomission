Chartered in 1957, the Seneca Park Zoo Society supports and promotes the Seneca Park Zoo by running educational programs, special events, marketing and public relations efforts, fund raising, and food and gift operations. Through the exhibition of animals in naturalistic settings, the Seneca Park Zoo provides engaging and educational experiences to give our community the motivation and skills to act as stewards of the environment. The zoo is one of the leading attractions in the Rochester area and improvements continue to enhance the zoo experience.
