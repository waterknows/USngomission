The Orlando Union Rescue Mission has been caring for the hungry and hurting in the Orlando area since its founding in 1948 by a group of Christian businessmen. Orlando Union Rescue Mission is a faith-based organization, whose mission is to provide those in need with food, shelter, clothing, and other resources to help the homeless build their lives and achieve self sufficiency. The foundation of our work is Biblically based to bring people to know the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior. The mission provided 82,100 nights of lodging for clients in 2007.
