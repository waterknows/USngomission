Founded in 1997, the mission of Medical Bridges is to bridge the healthcare gap by procuring medical, dental and surgical supplies and equipment for redistribution to qualified organizations and medical missions primarily in the developing world. Sponsoring organizations such as churches, civic groups, local corporations doing business abroad, and international organizations all have to apply to send medical supplies to clinics and/or hospitals in developing countries. The application process ensures that we are sending supplies to a qualified facility that serves the indigent population.
