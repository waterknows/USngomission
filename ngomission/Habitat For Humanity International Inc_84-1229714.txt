Flatirons Habitat for Humanity (FHFH) works to eliminate poverty housing and homelessness in Boulder and Broomfield Counties of Colorado. Habitat for Humanity works in partnership with God and people everywhere, from all walks of life, to develop communities with people in need by building houses so that there are decent homes in decent communities in which every person can experience God's love and can live and grow into all that God intends. Habitat invites people of all backgrounds, races and religions to build houses together in partnership with families in need.
