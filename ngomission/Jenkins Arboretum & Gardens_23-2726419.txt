Jenkins Arboretum opened to the public in 1976. Jenkins Arboretum is one of eastern Pennsylvania's major horticultural and environmental assets. As a botanical garden, it preserves and nurtures forty-six acres of Chester County's rapidly disappearing natural environments. The Arboretum is one of Pennsylvania's major horticultural showcases of native trees, shrubs, rhododendrons, azaleas, laurel, blueberries, ferns and wildflowers. Our mission is to preserve natural tranquil woodlands for community enjoyment, to showcase native plants and a world class collection of rhododendrons and azaleas, and to promote environmental horticulture through learning, research and conservation.
