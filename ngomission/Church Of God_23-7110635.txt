Founded in 1920, Smoky Mountain Children's Home is a private, Christian multi-service agency that provides professional care and treatment for boys and girls referred for our services due to emotional, behavioral, and life situations. A continuum of quality programs (Residential Care, Foster Care, Adoption, Training and Support) is offered to meet the unique needs of children of different ages, capacities, races and creeds; and their families. We are dedicated to achieving excellence, and will use our knowledge and resources to advocate, enrich, and empower the lives of children and families living out our call to minister the gospel of Jesus Christ.
