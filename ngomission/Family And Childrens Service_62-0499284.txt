Family & Children's Service (FCS) serves all people in crisis and transition by meeting them where they are, understanding their needs, and connecting them to the resources they need. FCS often â€˜fills in the gaps' in social services, creating a safety net to ensure that all children and families can be safe and healthy. Each year we provide direct services to more than 32,000 clients, and phone-based crisis, intervention, and referral services to another 200,000 Tennesseans.
