The purpose of Aldersgate Renewal Ministries (ARM) is to equip the local church to minister to the world in the power of the Holy Spirit. Based on Jesus command Matthew 28:18-20 and Matthew 10:6-8, and on His instruction in Acts 1:8, we believe that the empowerment of the Holy Spirit is essential to carry on the ministry of Jesus. The Holy Spirit, God's divine power, has given us everything we need to do all that Jesus did, carrying on His ministry in His character and in His power (2 Peter 1:3-4). ARM seeks to come alongside local churches, equipping lay people and clergy to minister to the world in the character and the power of Jesus by the power of the Holy Spirit.
