Bridges from School to Work was established in 1989 by the Marriott Foundation for People with Disabilities to enhance employment opportunities for young people with disabilities by effectively matching them to employers' entry-level workforce needs. The Bridges staff works one-on-one with enthusiastic and capable young people upon exiting high school, helping them to successfully enter the workforce in a job that fits their interests and ability, while planning for long term vocational growth. Concurrently, Bridges from School to Work provides businesses with customized job placement and workforce development solutions, which enhances both productivity and workforce diversification.
