Opened in 1963, the New York Studio School is committed to giving a significant education to the aspiring artist that can last a lifetime. The New York Studio School is where drawing, painting and sculpture are studied in depth, debated energetically and created with passion. Our goal for young artists is for them to find their own personal vision through the investigation of art and the visual world around us. The School continues to grow in strength and has maintained a belief in its original vision: faith in the great language of art; a total commitment to research and excellence; the support for intensity, integrity and serious work habits; the encouragement of an open mind, and the conviction of the power of art to change one's life.
