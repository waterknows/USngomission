Calvary Children's Home's purpose is to provide a safe, loving, Christian environment for children needing placement apart from their families, where each child is given the opportunity to reach their full potential in their personal, emotional and spiritual life. The Home is located in the heart of West Cobb outside of Atlanta, Georgia. Its beautiful 25 acres of combination woodland and open landscape serve as a great location for our children. Since the Home's beginning in 1966, we've had the privilege of offering a home to well over 400 children. Our goal is to provide them with opportunities that challenge and prepare them for life in a difficult and demanding society by showing love, acceptance, understanding and encouragement.
