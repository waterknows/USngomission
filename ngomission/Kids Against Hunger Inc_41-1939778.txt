Kids Against Hunger is a non-profit humanitarian organization with a mission to provide fully nutritious food to impoverished children and families around the world...and around the corner. The goal of the organization is for its meals to provide a stable nutritional base from which recipient families can move their families from starvation or food insecurity to self-sufficiency. Since its launch, Kids Against Hunger has provided over one billion meals for children and their families in more than 60 countries through the efforts of hundreds of thousands of volunteers and partnerships with humanitarian organizations in the United States and worldwide. With over 70 satellite locations in the United States and Canada, Kids Against Hunger is the world's largest humanitarian feeding network. We currently pack over 50 million meals a year with a goal of packing over 100 million in the next 2 years.
