United Way of the Capital Area, Mississippi was established as a Community Chest in 1939 by civic-minded leaders in Jackson, Mississippi. United Way of the Capital Area provides educational and asset building opportunities that create pathways out of poverty for families in Hinds, Madison and Rankin counties. Our strategy is to invest, advocate, and leverage resources in order to solve problems at their root causes. Our goals for providing opportunities for successful lives for families in the tri-county area are focused in our community impact strategies: education, financial stability, quality affordable housing, and quality affordable health care.
