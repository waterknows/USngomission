Since 1991, The Committee for Missing Children (CMC) and its photo partners have distributed over two billion images of missing children in elementary schools throughout the USA. Millions of images of approximately 1,500 children have bombarded our nations' elementary schools and, through this method, we have assisted in the recovery of over 1,200 missing children. We are a parent advocacy group and we serve as an information clearinghouse. Our web site is created as a resource for parents of missing children as well as lawyers, other non-profits and non-governmental agencies, and the agencies that must deal with child abduction. Our belief is that the parents of missing and abducted children have a right to be involved in the search for their own children.
