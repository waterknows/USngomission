Friends of Animals (FoA), founded in 1957, works to cultivate a respectful view of nonhuman animals, free-living and domestic.  Our goal is to free animals from cruelty and institutionalized exploitation around the world. The organization has evolved from its beginnings as the most comprehensive low-cost spay neuter program in the country, funding more than 2.5 million procedures.Friends of Animals now places critical habitat, wildlife protection and veganism at the core of animal advocacy. We inform members about animal advocacy issues and our progress in addressing them through our magazine, Action Line, and our website.
