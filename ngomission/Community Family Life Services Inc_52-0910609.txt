Community Family Life Services (CFLS) was founded in 1969 by First Trinity Lutheran Church to address the needs of recently released ex-offenders and their families. Since then, we have grown and evolved to provide services to low-income and homeless families and individuals in the District of Columbia and now serve more than 5,000 people annually. At CFLS, our mission is to give people living in poverty and homelessness the tools they need to move towards permanent economic and social self-sufficiency. Not only do we offer short-term crisis assistance, but we also empower families and individuals to change their lives for the better. Our dedicated staff and volunteers provide a variety of services in the following areas: housing services; supportive services & community outreach; and youth development and advocacy.
