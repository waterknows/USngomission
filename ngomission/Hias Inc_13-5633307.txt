HIAS is the global Jewish organization that protects refugees-including women and children, and ethnic, religious, and sexual minorities-whose lives are in danger for being who they are. Guided by our values and history, HIAS helps refugees rebuild their lives in safety and advocates to ensure that all displaced people are treated with dignity.
