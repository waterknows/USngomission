Jewish Family & Children's Service of Greater Monmouth County provides innovative, responsive, cost effective, non-sectarian human services that enhance the quality of life for children, families and the aged in our community, while reflecting the shared compassion, ancient wisdom and unifying traditions of Judaism. In 2011, we celebrated 35 years of providing comprehensive, caring Mental Health and Social Services to the residents of Monmouth County, regardless of their age, income, social status, race or religion. The JF&CS of Greater Monmouth County continues to serve the community through three offices --Asbury Park, Morganville, Eatontown--, with more than 30 needed and imaginative programs.
