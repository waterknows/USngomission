The Catholic Schools Foundation (CSF) supports the educational mission of the Church while helping to provide programs and services that insure optimal educational opportunities for all students regardless of race, religion, national origin, or gender attending Roman Catholic primary and secondary schools located in the Archdiocese of Boston. In the twenty years since its founding, CSF has partnered with individuals, businesses and foundations to provide scholarships, programs and services that this year alone will impact over 16,000 students in our inner-city and neighborhood schools. Our overarching goal at CSF is to provide a quality education for every child who desires it.
