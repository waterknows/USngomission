The mission of Legal Information for Families Today (LIFT) is to enhance access to justice for children and families by providing legal information, community education, and compassionate guidance, while promoting system-wide reform of the courts and public agencies. LIFT was launched in 1996 when three lawyers had the simple but revolutionary idea of establishing go-to locations in New York City's Family Courts that would provide on-the-spot help and legal information for vulnerable families struggling to make their way through the complex Court system. Before LIFT, there was no source of information or guidance available, and families were left to fend for themselves in a confusing and intimidating Court system. Today, LIFT operates innovative, award-winning programs in the Family Courts and in the community, all of which share the goal of promoting positive outcomes for families and children.
