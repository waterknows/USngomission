Founded in 1990, the Family Giving Tree's mission is to offer assistance to as many people as possible through the Giving Tree programs, by creating a simple and effective way for anyone to enrich their own life by helping others. We work with more than 250 Bay Area social service agencies that supply us with the names and wishes of the children they serve year-round. A wish card is printed for each child, detailing their age, gender, first name and their wish for a holiday gift. Over 900 Bay Area companies, schools and organizations participate in the program by displaying the wish cards, often on trees, in their lobbies and other public areas. It is the generosity of employees, customers and students that make this program a success. By selecting a wish card, they pledge to purchase a special gift for a child in need.
