Mothers' Club Family Learning Center prepares families living in isolation and poverty to succeed in school and in life through two-generation learning programs. To fulfill our mission, we provide FREE social services and educational programs to low-income, at-risk families with children ages 0-5. In all programs, parents and children are on-site, engaged in their own comprehensive curricula. Programs successfully increase literacy levels, educational outcomes and the emotional well-being of both generations. We currently serve over 100 parents and 112 children each year.
