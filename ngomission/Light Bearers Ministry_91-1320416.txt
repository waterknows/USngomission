Light Bearers Ministry is an evangelistic and edification ministry, reaching out to the world with the gospel of Christ and promoting revival and spiritual growth within the body of Christ. To carry forth this purpose we employ four media: we operate a missionary publishing house devoted to producing gospel literature free of charge; we conduct evangelistic and spiritual growth seminars for winning souls to Christ; we produce a discussion format Bible teaching TV and radio program called Book of the Book; and we are a rich source of literature, audio and video materials for sharing with others, and nurturing your own spiritual development.
