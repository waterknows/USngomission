The Lowcountry Food Bank works to feed the poor and hungry of the ten coastal counties of South Carolina by soliciting and distributing food and grocery products to nonprofit agencies serving the poor, and to educate the public about the problems of and solutions to domestic hunger. The Lowcountry Food Bank was founded in 1983 as a clearinghouse for donated food items through the generosity of both the Coastal Community Foundation of South Carolina and Trident United Way. Our service model is simple and cost-effective. We collect, inspect, maintain, and distribute otherwise wasted food products from manufacturers, food distributors, the government, supermarkets, wholesalers along with farmers to redistribute these food products to a grassroots network of 416 member agencies providing hunger-relief services.
