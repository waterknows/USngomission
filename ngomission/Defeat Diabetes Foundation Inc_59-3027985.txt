The mission of Defeat Diabetes Foundation (DDF) is to inform, educate and alert the general public, diabetics, pre-diabetics and elected officials about the disease, its prevention and the consequences of undiagnosed and/or poorly managed diabetes and to provide accurate, up-to-date and practical information on the treatment and self-management of the disease. Incorporated in 1991, DDF conducts programs each year to promote awareness, prevention and early detection. We are committed to continuing this work for the 24 million diabetics and 57 million pre-diabetics in the United States with the disease.
