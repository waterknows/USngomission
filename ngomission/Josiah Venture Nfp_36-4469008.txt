Josiah Venture's vision is to see a movement of God among the youth of Central and Eastern Europe that finds its home in the local church and transforms society. We have grown from three couples in 1993 to over 300 staff members today. Our staff, over half of which are nationals, are located in 14 countries in Central and Eastern Europe, along with support teams in North America and Canada. Thousands of young leaders are trained each year by our staff, and through those young leaders hundreds of new believers are entering the local church as a result of evangelistic and discipleship efforts.
