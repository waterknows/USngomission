The mission of the United Way of Greater St. Joseph is to improve lives through the caring power of community by giving, advocating and volunteering. Together, through United Way, our community works to advance these three priorities by meeting immediate needs and by addressing the underlying causes of problems. By LIVING UNITED, we advance the common good in Northwest Missouri and Northeast Kansas and aim for lasting, positive change in people's lives.
