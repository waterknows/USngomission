Founded in 1949, The National Kidney Foundation of Illinois improves the health and well-being of people at risk for or affected by kidney disease through prevention, education and empowerment. Educational programs and support are provided for individuals living with kidney disease and their families, continuing education programs for healthcare professionals, and advocacy to advance initiatives that directly affect the care and treatment of kidney disease. Through the KidneyMobile program, the most comprehensive and accessible screening, education and referral program of its kind, the National Kidney Foundation of Illinois is able to offer free prevention education and health screenings throughout the state, educating communities about the growing epidemic of kidney disease, diabetes and high blood pressure and the ways in which these diseases can be prevented.
