The San Francisco CASA Program (SFCASA) empowers everyday citizens to become officers of the court to serve as advocates and mentors to abused and neglected children in foster care. SFCASA volunteers provide judges with the crucial information needed to make sound decisions that affect the lives of foster children. Volunteers help these children by: advocating for safe, permanent, and nurturing homes; addressing their educational, healthcare, and other urgent needs; and helping them to develop permanent connections in the community. All volunteers are screened, trained, and supervised by professional SFCASA staff.
