City Year was founded in 1988 on the belief that young people can change the world. City Year unites young people of all backgrounds for a year of full-time service, giving them the skills and opportunities to change the world. As tutors, mentors and role models, these diverse young leaders help children stay in school and on track, and transform schools and communities across the United States, as well as through international affiliates in Johannesburg, South Africa and London, England. By giving corps members the skills and opportunities to serve in schools and neighborhoods across the country, City Year seeks to: help children succeed; build stronger communities; break down social barriers; develop young leaders; and foster active citizenship.
