The Alabama Ballet began in 1981 as an outgrowth of the Birmingham Civic Ballet, the University of Alabama at Birmingham Ballet and Ballet Alabama. Alabama Ballet's mission is to change lives through dance. We are proud to be our state's only Royal Academy of Dance ballet school. The premier, professional dance company consists of 23 professional dancers and 16 apprentices from all areas of the United States and abroad. Under the Artistic Direction of Tracey Alvey, we serve more than 30,000 individuals through high-caliber productions, dance education, and community outreach.
