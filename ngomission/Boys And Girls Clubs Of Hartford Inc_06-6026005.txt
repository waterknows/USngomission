As the birth place of the Boys & Girls Clubs movement in 1860, Boys & Girls Clubs of Hartford (BGCH) has been at the forefront of youth development for well over 150 years, working with young people from disadvantaged economic, social and family circumstances. We actively seek to enrich the lives of girls and boys who need us most. BGCH is dedicated to ensuring that our community's youngsters have greater access to quality programs and services that will enhance their lives and positively shape their futures. The mission of the Boys & Girls Clubs is to enable all young people, especially those who need us most, to reach their full potential as productive, responsible and caring citizens.
