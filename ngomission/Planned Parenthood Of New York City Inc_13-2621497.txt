Founded in 1916, Planned Parenthood of New York City (PPNYC) empowers individuals to make independent, informed decisions about their sexual and reproductive lives, we provide information and health care, and promote public policies that make those services available to all. Planning is power. Our ongoing bilingual Planning is Power campaign -- which positively promotes awareness about contraception -- underscores our commitment to prevention and proactive education. Likewise, our community and educational initiatives empower teens and adults to make informed and healthy decisions. At the same time, PPNYC works to protect the right of every woman to decide for herself when and whether to become a parent.
