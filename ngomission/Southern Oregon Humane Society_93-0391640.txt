The Southern Oregon Humane Society cares for and adopts more than 1400 dogs and cats each year. Adoptions include spay or neuter, up to date vaccinations, flea and tick preventative, 24PetWatch Microchip, and other products and services. Time limits are not placed on the lives of pets at the Southern Oregon Humane Society. Animals are never euthanized to make room for more. The Southern Oregon Humane Society is committed to educating the community about responsible pet care and the humane treatment of all beings. The Southern Oregon Humane Society's future includes planning for a new state of the art animal care, adoption and education center.
