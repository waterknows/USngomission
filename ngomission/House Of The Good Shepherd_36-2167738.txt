House of the Good Shepherd provides opportunities for abused women and their children to embark upon a new life of self-worth and dignity. Families come to us from domestic violence situations. While at the House of the Good Shepherd, women complete a comprehensive program of education, counseling, support group, budgeting and money management, and work skills training. Women are also mentored in positive parenting. Children, with mother's consent, participate in individual counseling, group therapy, and in multitude of educational and recreational opportunities that are provided by staff and volunteers. Average stay is about 9 months. House of the Good Shepherd strives to provide a safe place for these families, opportunities to experience healing, encouragement to become financially independent and break the cycle of abuse.
