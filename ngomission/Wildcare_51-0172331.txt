Founded in 1974, WildCare is a urban wildlife rehabilitation center. WildCare's mission is to advocate for wildlife for a sustainable world, and we actively pursue this mission through nature education, wildlife rehabilitation and community outreach. Through partnerships with schools, collaborations with other organizations, educational programs and activities, internships and volunteer opportunities we make a positive difference in our community. We work to make sure all species can coexist-- not just by treating sick or injured animals (over 3,000 of them a year), but also by teaching people how to live peacefully with wildlife and by advocating for better protection of wildlife and our remaining open spaces.
