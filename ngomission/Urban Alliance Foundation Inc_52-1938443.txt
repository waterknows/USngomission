Urban Alliance empowers under-resourced youth to aspire, work and succeed through paid internships, formal training, and mentorship. Urban Alliance is the only year long employment program for under-resourced high school seniors in Washington, D.C., Baltimore, MD, and Chicago, IL. Our goal is to give youth access to professional growth and experiences. The program prepares students for a life of work and self-sufficiency through paid internships, formal training, and mentorship. Urban Alliance Interns are selected after a rigorous application process. During the school year, each Urban Alliance Intern works part time with a job partner in the public or private sector. On Fridays, they attend life skills and job readiness workshops.
