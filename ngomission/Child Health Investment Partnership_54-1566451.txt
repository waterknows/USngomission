CHIP of Roanoke Valley is an early childhood home visiting program. We pair low-income children, ages birth to kindergarten-entry, with a Community Health Nurse and Family Case Manager for health care coordination (help accessing needed medical services, assistance with the management of chronic conditions, and preventive services like fluoride dental varnish); developmental education, kindergarten preparation and regular child assessment and monitoring. Their families receive services like anticipatory child development guidance, employment and education support, parent meetings and transportation. These services work to help build parenting capacity and to provide support to families as they set and reach goals and move toward self-sufficiency. CHIP also offers supplemental case management services that target specific needs: Prenatal Case Management, Mental Health Case Management, and Asthma Case Management.
