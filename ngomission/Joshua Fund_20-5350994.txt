The Joshua Fund was founded by Joel and Lynn Rosenberg in the summer of 2006. The desire of their heart was to bless poor and needy Jewish and Arab families in the epicenter; equip and encourage pastors and ministry leaders in the epicenter; and educate and mobilize Christians around the world to bless Israel and her neighbors in the name of Jesus Christ, according to Genesis 12:1-3.
