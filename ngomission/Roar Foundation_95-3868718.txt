The Roar Foundation supports the Shambala Preserve and shares its mission to educate the public about exotic animals; to advocate for legislation to protect them; and to provide sanctuary for exotic animals who have suffered from gross mistreatment and neglect so they can regain their physical and mental health and live out their lives in dignity. Shambala is home to more than 70 big cats. Once an animal is brought to Shambala, it remains here for the rest of its life. An important part of this aspect of The Roar Foundation's efforts is the series of wildlife programs presented for local children, and other youth groups, in the Southern California region.
