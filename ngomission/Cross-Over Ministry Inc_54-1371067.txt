Established by volunteers in 1983, CrossOver Health Care Ministry provides quality and compassionate health care to the uninsured in the greater Richmond Metropolitan area. Our mission is to provide health care, promote wellness, and connect community talents and resources with people in need in the name of Jesus Christ. CrossOver offers a full continuum of healthcare services to the uninsured that includes: family medicine, primary care, OB/GYN, dental and vision care, mental health care, HIV diagnosis and treatment, and an on-site community pharmacy. CrossOver operates a network of three free clinics located in areas of identified need in Richmond, serving more than 6,000 patients annually.
