The mission of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra (ISO) is to advance the enjoyment and appreciation of symphonic music through performances at the highest artistic level. The ISO, founded in 1930, is a professional orchestra that performs 200 concerts each year at the historic Hilbert Circle Theatre and at Conner Prairie Living History Museum, as well as sites around the state. In addition to the many classical and pops concerts in its home, the magnificent Hilbert Circle Theatre at Symphony Centre, the Orchestra is regularly heard in communities around Indiana and at the Marsh Symphony on the Prairie series each summer. The ISO is dedicated to leading in music education. Symphony musicians and staff create innovative learning opportunities for all ages inspired by the power of music.
