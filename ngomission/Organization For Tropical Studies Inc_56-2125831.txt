The Organization for Tropical Studies (OTS) is a consortium that has grown to include 63 universities and research institutions from the United States, Latin America and Australia. OTS was founded in 1963 to provide leadership in education, research and the responsible use of natural resources in the tropics. To address this mission, OTS conducts graduate and undergraduate education, facilitates research, participates in tropical forest conservation, maintains three biological stations in Costa Rica and conducts environmental education programs. Since its founding, OTS has offered over 200 graduate-level courses in the natural sciences and can count more than 3,600 graduate students and professionals as alumni.
