The American Chestnut Foundation (TACF) was founded in 1983 to restore the American chestnut tree to its native range within the woodlands of the eastern United States using a scientific research and breeding program developed by its founders. We harvested our first blight-resistant nuts in 2005, and the Foundation hopes to begin reforestation trials with blight-resistant American-type trees before the end of this decade, using sound ecological principles. We also provide educational opportunities to our nation's youth through our educational outreach programs, including the Charlie Chestnut Environmental Program and the Chestnut Tree Loaner Laboratory.
