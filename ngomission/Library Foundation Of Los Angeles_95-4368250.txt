The Library Foundation of Los Angeles supports and enriches the capabilities, resources and services of the Los Angeles Public Library. The Library Foundation was founded in 1992 to raise private sector support to benefit the entire Library system. We accomplish our mission through fundraising, advocacy, and innovative programs that benefit our diverse community and promote greater awareness of the Library's valuable resources. Our support complements, but does not supplant, the City's responsibility for funding the Los Angeles Public Library's operations. To date, the foundation has raised more than $75 million to help support the Central Library and its 71 neighborhood branches.
