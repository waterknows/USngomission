PAWS Chicago is the city's largest no kill humane organization, focused on implementing solutions to end the killing of homeless pets. Since PAWS Chicago's founding in 1997, the number of homeless dogs and cats killed annually has dropped more than 60 percent: from more than 42,000 homeless pets killed in 1997 to under 18,000 killed in 2011. PAWS Chicago is working to build a no kill Chicago - a city where pets are no longer destroyed just because they are homeless. PAWS Chicago will find new homes for more than 5,000 homeless pets this year at the state-of-the-art Lincoln Park Adoption & Humane Center. The PAWS Chicago Lurie Spay/Neuter Clinic, the largest free spay/neuter clinic in Chicago and the nation, will sterilize more than 18,000 pets of low-income families this year.
