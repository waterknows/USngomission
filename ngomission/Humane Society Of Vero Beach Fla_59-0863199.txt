Since 1953, the Humane Society of Vero Beach and Indian River County (HSVB&IRC) has committed to making a better community for its people and animals by: providing humane care and shelter for homeless animals; placing adoptable pets in permanent, loving homes; promoting spaying and neutering of companion animals; promoting responsible pet ownership and the respect for all life through humane education; protecting animals from cruelty; and pledging to be advocates for animal protection. Beyond sheltering pets, we provide services to encourage pets and their families to stay together. For this reason, humane education and behavior training are critical parts of our program at HSVB&IRC.
