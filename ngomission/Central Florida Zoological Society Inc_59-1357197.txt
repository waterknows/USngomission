The Central Florida Zoo & Botanical Gardens is dedicated to preserving the beauty and wonder of animals and their habitats. We are committed to sharing our knowledge, engaging visitors, and celebrating our natural world. First established as the Sanford Zoo in 1923, the zoo continues to grow as Seminole County's premier recreational and educational attraction. Discovering animals is just the beginning. Over 75,000 school children participate in formal education programs every year, fostering an appreciation for animals and the importance of biodiversity. Conservation of animals is paramount; Species Survival Plans, coordinated through the Association of Zoos & Aquariums, are attempting to maintain genetic diversity to ensure healthy, vigorous animals to reproduce now and in the future.
