Heart of West Michigan United Way's mission is to mobilize the caring power of individuals and organizations to help people measurably improve their lives. Our vision is a vibrant, safe and caring community where all children thrive and all people enjoy maximum health and self-sufficiency. United Way advances the common good by focusing on education, income and health. These are the building blocks for a good life - a quality education that leads to a stable job, enough income to support a family through retirement, and good health.
