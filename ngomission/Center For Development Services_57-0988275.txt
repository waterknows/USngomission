The Center for Developmental Services (CDS) is not just a place where families can come to receive multiple developmental services and support under one roof, it is a collaboration that benefits everyone - the partner agencies, the staff in the facility, the families we serve, and the community at large. CDS is a unique partnership linking individuals and families with multi-disciplinary services for developmental evaluation, treatment, education and support. Our vision is to ensure that individuals with developmental needs and their families reach their full potential. Founded in March 2000, the CDS partnership serves children from all over the upstate of South Carolina.
