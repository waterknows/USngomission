The Preservation Trust of Vermont was founded in 1980 to initiate, stimulate and assist local and statewide efforts to preserve and use Vermont's rich collection of historic, architectural cultural and community resources. We help through planning grants, technical assistance, preservation grants, and a variety of educational tools. Much of this work is in partnership with local organizations, communities and individual Vermonters who are actively working to protect and restore significant historic properties, downtowns and community centers. The Preservation Trust has assisted community leaders, volunteers, and nonprofit organizations in virtually every community in Vermont.
