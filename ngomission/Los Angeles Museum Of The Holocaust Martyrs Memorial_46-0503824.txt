Los Angeles Museum of the Holocaust (LAMOTH) is the oldest Holocaust museum in the United States. We have a two-fold mission that has remained constant since its inception in 1961: commemoration and education. LAMOTH dedicates itself as a primary source institution, one that commemorates those who perished and honors those who survived by housing the precious artifacts that miraculously weathered the Holocaust. LAMOTH provides free Holocaust education to the public, particularly students from underfunded schools and underserved communities. We are committed to providing opportunities for dialogue with Holocaust Survivors, who are the living embodiment of history.
