Since opening in 1931, The Lensic has been an anchor in Santa Fe's downtown. Now, the restored theater thrives as the city's premier performing arts center, with a diverse program of world-class theater, music, dance, film and lecturers. More than just a performance venue, the Lensic is an organization with extensive programs that build partnerships within the community, provide support to fellow non-profits and include youth in all aspects of the performing arts. And we are working hard, alongside the many performing groups who use the Lensic, to ensure that audiences are continually offered new and exciting performances by presenting our own unique programs and collaborating with local artists to develop original works.
