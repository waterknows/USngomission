Incorporated in 1994, Churches of Christ Disaster Relief Effort immediately responds to any major disaster in the continental United States by sending truckloads of emergency food, water, cleaning, and other supplies to disaster victims. The organization has distributed more than $106 million in emergency food and supplies in response to 301 disasters in 42 states. Churches of Christ Disaster Relief only works through the local Church of Christ in the community or town, where the disaster has occurred. If there is no Church of Christ in the town, Disaster Relief will contact the nearest town that has a Church of Christ and ask for help. Supplies will be distributed by this congregation in the name of th-e Lord to anyone who has been affected by the disaster regardless of race, color, creed, or religion.
