The Cancer Federation was founded in 1977 by a number of physicians and a young researcher who were concerned that virtually no funds were going into the important field of cancer immunology, and no charity was educating the public and the scientific community about this important field. The Federation provides information, counseling, educational materials and meetings for the cancer patients, their families and friends. The Federation has provided help for thousands of people over the last 25 years. The fear and apprehension each person faces when confronted with cancer is well documented. In order to successfully cope with this life-threatening disease, many people turn to the Cancer Federation for information and support.
