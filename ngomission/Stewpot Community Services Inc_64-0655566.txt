Founded in 1981, Stewpot Community Services provides thousands of men, women and children with hot meals, groceries, clothing, shelter, childcare, mentoring and other programs to nurture them and help them get back on their feet. Stewpot, which began as a simple soup kitchen, has developed into an organization offering 17 series - from shelter, to clothing, to counseling, to children's programs. We recognize the giftedness in everyone who walks through our doors and affirm the importance of inter-faith and ecumenical cooperation.
