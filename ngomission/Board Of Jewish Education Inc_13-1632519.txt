The Jewish Education Project pioneers new approaches for every age. We connect forward-thinking educators to powerful ideas and resources so we can create new models that change how, what and where people learn. We recognize that as society changes, the way we educate must adapt right along with it. We believe that every Jewish family should have a path to affordable, accessible, and inspiring Jewish education for their children. We connect forward-thinking educators to powerful ideas and resources so we can create new models that change how, what, and where people learn. Together with our partners, we're transforming Jewish education for today's ever-changing world and helping to shape the future of the Jewish people.
