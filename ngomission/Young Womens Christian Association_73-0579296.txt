YWCA Tulsa is dedicated to eliminating racism, empowering women and promoting peace, justice, freedom and dignity for all. We accomplish this mission locally by advocating for all Tulsans to succeed through wellness, wealth, and education. YWCA Tulsa's programs include health & wellness, immigration services, and activities for senior citizens.
