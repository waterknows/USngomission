Founded in 1992, the ChairScholars Foundation works to help physically disabled, disadvantaged young people obtain a college education or vocational training. Higher education is the most vital link to economic empowerment and self-sufficiency. Yet, an astonishing 73% of physically disabled people can't obtain a post-secondary education due to the monumental financial burden their disability creates. ChairScholars Foundation began when founder Hugo A. Keim, M.D., former Chief of Spinal Surgery at the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, witnessed the struggles of many disabled youngsters and sent two students who were in wheelchairs to college. To date, over 800 scholarships have been awarded.
