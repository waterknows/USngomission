Founded as Project Conserve in 1974, the Inner City Christian Federation (ICCF) is a housing corporation whose leadership is motivated, and programs shaped by: the belief that all people deserve safe, clean, affordable housing; our response to God's desire that we seek justice in our communities; our grateful response to the saving love of Jesus Christ; and our desire to have others see his love in action. ICCF upholds and strengthens families through the creation of quality and affordable housing with the provision of supportive and educational services. Our services are an investment in their future and in the future of our community.
