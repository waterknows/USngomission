The mission of the Hampton Roads Community Foundation is to inspire philanthropy and transform the quality of life in southeastern Virginia. The Foundation provides a vehicle for people of all means to make a lasting difference in their community by creating funds. Our roots extend to 1950 when Norfolk civic leaders donated $2,350 to create The Norfolk Foundation -- the first community foundation in Virginia. It was started to serve residents of Norfolk "and a 50-mile radius." In 1987 civic leaders from Virginia Beach created the Virginia Beach Foundation to provide charitable resources primarily to benefit Virginia Beach residents. In January 1, 2010 the Hampton Roads Community Foundation formed when the Norfolk and Virginia Beach foundations merged becoming the largest grant and scholarship provider in Hampton Roads.
