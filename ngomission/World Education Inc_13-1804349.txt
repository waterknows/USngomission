Founded in 1951 to meet the needs of the educationally disadvantaged, World Education provides training and technical assistance in nonformal education across a wide array of sectors. All World Education projects are designed to strengthen the capacity of local partner institutions, catalyze community and national development, and contribute to individual growth. World Education supports the development of many types of indigenous non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and community-based organizations (CBOs) to achieve long-term results. World Education strives to develop assets such as good health, literacy, numeracy, business and civic participation skills, and access to credit. World Education has worked in over 60 countries in all regions of the globe to provide training and technical assistance in many sectors.
