In 1989, a group of members of Belmont Church in Nashville heard God's calling to find a biblical solution to meet the needs of people with limited resources who were suffering due to a lack of health insurance. From that vision, Siloam Family Health Center was born. While Siloam began as a neighborhood clinic, today it serves uninsured people from all over Nashville and the surrounding areas. Patients are asked to participate in their health care by making a contribution depending on the services provided and their financial ability. No one is ever turned away because they cannot afford to contribute to the ministry. Siloam does not bill patients and we do not file insurance.
