Opened in 1992, the Florida Holocaust Museum honors the memory of millions of innocent men, women, and children who suffered or died in the Holocaust. The Museum is dedicated to teaching members of all races and cultures to recognize the inherent worth and dignity of human life in order to prevent future genocides. The Museum houses the premier permanent exhibit, History, Heritage and Hope, a compelling history of individuals of strength, courage and spirit, who confronted the extremes of hatred and persecution in their homes and communities. The Museum's education department creates stimulating educational programs that engage learners through using highly developed materials on the Holocaust, human rights, and genocide studies.
