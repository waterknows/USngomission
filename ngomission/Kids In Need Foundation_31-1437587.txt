Founded in 1995, Kids In Need Foundation works to ensure that every child is prepared to learn and succeed by providing free school supplies nationally to students most in need. The mission is achieved by providing free school supplies to students and teachers through the Kids In Need National Network of Resource Centers, awarding grants to teachers for innovative classroom projects through the Kids In Need Teacher Grants program, and developing community school supplies giveaway programs through the School Ready Supplies program.
