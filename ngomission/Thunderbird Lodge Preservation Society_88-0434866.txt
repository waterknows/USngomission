The mission of Thunderbird Lake Tahoe is to preserve and protect Thunderbird Lodge and its artifacts and museum collections as a historic site of national significance. We promote public appreciation and education regarding the historical, maritime, architectural, and cultural resources of Thunderbird Lodge and the Lake Tahoe region through public tours, conferences, and forums. We also support and participate in programs committed to the scientific study, conservation, and preservation of the fragile Lake Tahoe area environment.
