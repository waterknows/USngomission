Indian Muslim Relief and Charities (IMRC) is dedicated to alleviating poverty in India. The donations it raises, from individuals throughout the United States, fund its charitable projects in India. Even the smallest of donations can greatly benefit an orphaned child or a widowed woman. Charity has always been an integral aspect of a Muslim society. The Quran places great emphasis on giving to the poor, and our beloved Prophet (pbuh) is reported to have said that wealth does not diminish by charity. When you donate to IMRC, you are supporting a network of more than 100 Muslim organizations in India. These organizations provide educational and financial support to thousands of orphans, destitute children and needy families. Your generous donations also support medical clinics, women's training centers and other social welfare institutions.
