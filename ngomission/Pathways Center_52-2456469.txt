Since 1985, Pathways.org has used evidence-based practice and multimedia as tools to promote each child's fullest inclusion. We strive to empower health professionals and parents with knowledge of the benefit of early detection and early intervention for children's sensory, motor, and communication development. The Pathways Center is a state-of-the-art pediatric therapy clinic in Glenview, IL, offering best practices in physical, occupational, and speech therapy services.
