MISSIONSeattle Men's Chorus and Seattle Women's Chorus entertain, enlighten, unify and heal our audience and members, using the power of words and music to recognize the value of gay and straight people and their relationships.ABOUT USFlying House Productions is home to two of the largest community choruses in America: Seattle Men's Chorus, founded in 1979, which is also the largest gay men's chorus in the world with over 300 singing members; and Seattle Women's Chorus, which made its premier on stage in 2002 and has quickly grown to over 250 singers. Each Chorus has a small ensemble of 9 to 11 members each (Captain Smartypants & Sensible Shoes), which further the mission of the organization by performing as ambassadors for the larger Choruses. We have a base of over 50 volunteer associate members who support both Choruses.Our full-scale productions expand the possibility of choral performances and have enormous appeal. More than 30,000 people attend the 5-concert season annually.
