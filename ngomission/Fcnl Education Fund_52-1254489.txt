The Friends Committee on National Legislation (FCNL) Education Fund exists in parallel with FCNL to support the research, analysis and education for which FCNL is known and respected. FCNL's multi-issue advocacy connects historic Quaker testimonies on peace, equality, simplicity, and truth with peace and social justice issues which the United States government is or should be addressing. In the last six-and-a-half decades, FCNL has played a pivotal role in the creation of the Peace Corps, was instrumental in lobbying for the creation of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, helped lobby for the Civil Rights Act, and led efforts in Washington to oppose both the first and second Iraq wars.
