Big Brothers Big Sisters of Central Indiana develops mentors committed to helping boys and girls grow into the next generation of caring, confident and competent adults. Our one-to-one mentoring program is built upon nationally recognized research and practices that honor and value the wide range of developmental needs of boys and girls as well as the diversity of their communities. Big Brothers Big Sisters of Central Indiana formed as a result of a merger of two strong organizations, Big Brothers of Greater Indianapolis (founded in 1970) and Big Sisters of Central Indiana (founded in 1971). These organizations operated successfully for 30 years before the boards of both agencies agreed to merge operations and missions in 2002.
