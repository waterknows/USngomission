Founded in 1986, the mission of Student Mobilization is to build spiritual leaders for Christ from the college campuses of the world. The students of today will be tomorrow's business men and women, church leaders, missionaries, educators and community leaders, pastors and teachers, and moms and dads. Our desire is to equip them to live for Christ wherever they may go. Student Mobilization includes about 160 families and individuals who have given their lives to reach and mobilize college students. Also, Stu Mo has an extended family of former students, donors and other friends who love, pray for, financially support and hold accountable these precious staff members.
