The Center for International Policy is a nonprofit research and advocacy organization based in Washington, D.C. Our programs address the most urgent threats to our planet: war, corruption, inequality and climate change.We are Washington insiders with an outsider's agenda. CIP's mix of former senior government officials, journalists, academics and activists brings insider's access, scholarly rigor and media savvy as well as the passion and organizing skills of seasoned activists. We advocate policies that advance international cooperation, demilitarization, respect for human rights and action to alleviate climate change and stop illicit financial flows. Our programs examine the policy implications of important issues, including the drug war, military budget, global financial integrity and climate change. CIP provides policy recommendations and analysis to decision makers in government, international organizations, the private sector and civil society.
