Make-A-Wish Georgia grants the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions to enrich the human experience with hope, strength and joy. We serve every community throughout the state of Georgia, and grant the wishes of children regardless of race, religion or socioeconomic status. Any child between the ages of 2 1/2 and 18, who has been determined by a physician to have a life-threatening medical condition and has not been granted a previous wish, is eligible. Our chapter has been granting wishes since 1995 and has impacted the lives of nearly 6,000 children by helping to make their most heartfelt wishes come true.
