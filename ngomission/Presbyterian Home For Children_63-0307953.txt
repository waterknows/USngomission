The Presbyterian Home for Children, recognizing the changing needs of children and families, and responding to the call of Jesus Christ to be agents of reconciliation, does hereby covenant, in reliance upon the Grace of God, to provide a ministry of comprehensive programs and services to individuals and families in order that they might become the fully functional persons whom God created them to be. We further covenant to treat each individual in need with dignity, and to bring every available resource to bear in the healing process. Our programs include child care, recreation and camps.
