Stand for Children Leadership Center is a leadership development and training organization. We train ordinary people to be effective citizen leaders capable of solving problems facing children, both locally and statewide, by convincing elected officials and voters to invest in and reform vital children's programs. Our highly trained staff provide parents and others concerned about children's issues with tools to achieve long-lasting improvements for children by joining together in a unified, grassroots voice.
