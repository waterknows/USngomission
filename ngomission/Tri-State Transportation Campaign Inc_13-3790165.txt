The Tri-State Transportation Campaign (TSTC) is dedicated to reducing car dependency in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. TSTC was formed as a response to the mounting economic and environmental costs of automobile and truck dependence and promising reforms in federal transportation policy. The Campaign marshals the talents of the region's most effective environmental and transportation policy watchdogs into a dynamic combination of community and campaign organizing, technical analysis, and media and legal advocacy. The Campaign's board of directors consists of senior staff from the founding organizations. In the fifteen years since our founding, the Campaign has enjoyed a strong record of accomplishment.
