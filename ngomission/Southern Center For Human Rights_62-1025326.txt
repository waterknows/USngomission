Established in 1976, the Southern Center for Human Rights (SCHR) is a public-interest law firm dedicated to enforcing the civil and human rights of people in the criminal justice system in the South. Since its creation, SCHR has been engaged in litigation, public education, advocacy, and work with other organizations and individuals to protect the civil and human rights of people prosecuted in the criminal courts - particularly those facing the death penalty - and confined in the prisons and jails of the South. SCHR's work has been widely recognized and is the subject of two books, Proximity to Death by Pulitzer-Prize winning historian William S. McFeely and Finding Life on Death Row by Katya Lezin.
