1000 Friends of Oregon was founded in 1975 by Governor Tom McCall and Henry Richmond as the citizens' voice for sound land use planning. Their goal was to protect Oregon's quality of life from the effects of uncontrolled growth. Today, 1000 Friends staff focus on education and advocacy, to engage Oregonians in a fresh conversation about Oregon's future, and how to make sure it's a future we all want. We seek to enhance the quality of life we enjoy in Oregon, with beautiful natural areas, the family-owned farms and woodlots that comprise our working landscapes, and vibrant, livable communities for urban and rural residents alike.
