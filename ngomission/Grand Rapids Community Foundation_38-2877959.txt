Founded in 1922, the Grand Rapids Community Foundation is Michigan's first community foundation. Our mission is to build and manage our community's permanent endowment and lead the community to strengthen the lives of its people. Since 1930 when the Foundation made its first grant, hundreds of thousands of people's lives have been enriched through grants and scholarships totaling almost $160 million. The role of the Foundation has grown from simple grant maker to a community leader seeking long-term solutions to diverse community challenges.
