The Ten Chimneys Foundation was formed in 1996 to preserve and share the buildings, furnishings, collections, and grounds of a national treasure - Ten Chimneys, the estate created by Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne. The Foundation also serves as a continuing resource and powerful inspiration for theatre, the arts, and the art of living, and offers public programs consistent with the Lunts' varied interests and core values, while maintaining the integrity and intimacy of this extraordinary estate. Ten Chimneys is open to the public as a world-class house museum and resource for theatre, arts, and arts education. The estate is a National Historic Landmark, a Save America's Treasures project site, and is listed in the National Registry of Historic Places.
