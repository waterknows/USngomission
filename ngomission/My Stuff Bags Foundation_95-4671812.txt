Founded in 1998, My Stuff Bags Foundation provides comfort and a message of hope to abused and neglected children entering crisis and foster care through its unique program, My Stuff Bags. More than 300,000 children across America must be rescued each year from dangerous home environments. Traumatized by the events leading to their rescue, these children often arrive without any of their own belongings. The Foundation's mission is to provide powerful advocacy on behalf of abused, abandoned and neglected children across the United States. The Foundation rallies widespread involvement through the My Stuff Bags program, to address the needs of these children and support the organizations caring for them. The foundation's ultimate goal is to provide a My Stuff Bag to each of the over 300,000 children entering crisis and foster care each year.
