Family Shelter Service transforms lives by offering help and hope to those affected by domestic violence. Family Shelter Service was founded in 1976 by a group of caring and concerned individuals who wanted to help the growing numbers of homeless people in DuPage County. In 1982, with the passage of the Illinois Domestic Violence Act, the Court Advocacy Program was implemented. The Children's Program was added in 1984. In 1986, a second 18-bed shelter opened. A third shelter that houses our special transitional program opened in 1989, bringing the total shelter capacity to 43 beds. Also in 1989, Family Shelter Service played a significant role in the development and implementation of the DuPage County Domestic Violence Protocol, which provides the structure for the community's response to domestic violence.
