The Boys & Girls Clubs of Martin County's mission is to inspire and assist all young people, especially those who need us most, to realize their full potential as productive, responsible and caring citizens. The Boys & Girls Clubs of Martin County is a youth development organization dedicated to promoting the educational, vocational, health leadership and character of boys and girls in a safe, nurturing environment. The Clubs provide more than a safe, fun and constructive alternative to being home alone - they offer a variety of award-winning developmental programs to help youth build skills, self-esteem and values during critical periods of growth. Currently, we serve more than 2,500 members and reach out to about 4,100 other children in the community.
