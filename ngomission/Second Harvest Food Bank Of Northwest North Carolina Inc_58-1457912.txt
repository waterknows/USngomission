The Second Harvest Food Bank of Northwest North Carolina was founded in 1981 and opened its doors in 1982 to address the growing needs of people seeking emergency food assistance in Northwest North Carolina. Since then, we have experienced dramatic growth in food distribution, operations and programming to better serve our more than 390 partner agencies and the thousands of people who rely on the food they provide each year. To date, the Second Harvest Food Bank has distributed nearly 100 million pounds of food to non-profit agencies and churches that feed our hungry neighbors in 18 counties. We are a member of Feeding America, a collaborative and coordinated network of more than 200 food banks united nationally and operating locally.
