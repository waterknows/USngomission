UW Sports Ministry is an equipping ministry that enhances the vision of the Church by providing sports related resources for the effective communication of the gospel. The mission of UW Sports Ministry is to see churches both in the United States and around the world using sports as an evangelism tool. We believe that our alternative VBS sports camp materials can enable many churches around the world to bring children to Christ in a new manner as compared to traditional outreach programs.
