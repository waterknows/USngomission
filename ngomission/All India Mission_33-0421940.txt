All India Mission's founder N.J. Varughese received a vision in 1975. This vision was to spread God's word to the suffering people in northeast India, and bring Christianity to India. As the mission grew larger and stronger, the need for additional services began to grow as well. Some of the amazing things All India Mission does include medical outreach, education, orphanages, micro-enterprises, and spreading the gospel by Evangelism and church planting. We continue to grow and convert thousands of Christians every year, and with your help we can fulfill the great commission, bringing hope to the world- starting with northeast India.
