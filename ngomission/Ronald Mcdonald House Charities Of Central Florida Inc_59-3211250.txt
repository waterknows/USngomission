Ronald McDonald House Charities of Central Florida (RMHCCF) finds, creates and supports programs that directly improve the health and well being of children and families. Our cornerstone program, the Ronald McDonald House (RMH), provides a home-away-from-home that offers comfort and care to families of children being treated at local hospitals and medical facilities. There are two Ronald McDonald Houses in Orlando; one is located on the campus of Florida Hospital for Children and the other is on the campus of Arnold Palmer Medical Center.
