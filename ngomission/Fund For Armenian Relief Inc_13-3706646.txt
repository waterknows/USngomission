The Fund for Armenian Relief (FAR) was founded in 1988 in response to a devastating earthquake. FAR provides short-term emergency relief and implements long-term programs for the economic growth and social development of Armenia. It helps the most vulnerable segments of the population - children and the elderly - and prepares the youth and professionals to drive the country's new democratic state. FAR implements a wide range of programs in Armenia and Karabagh: from emergency relief to construction to education, medical aid, and economic development. Since its inception, FAR has channeled more than $265 million in humanitarian assistance to Armenia.
