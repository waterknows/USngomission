Eye to Eye's mission is to improve the life of every person with a learning disability. We fulfill our mission by supporting and growing a network of youth mentoring programs run by and for those with learning differences, and by organizing advocates to support the full inclusion of people with learning disabilities and ADHD in all aspects of society. Our vision is simple, yet bold: to create a world in which people with LD/ADHD are fully accepted, valued, and respected - not just by society, but also by themselves - and that they live free from second thoughts or worry, ready, able, and eager to apply their unique strengths to whatever they encounter in life.
