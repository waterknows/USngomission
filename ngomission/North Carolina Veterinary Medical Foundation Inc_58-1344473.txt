Created in 1978 to attract funding for the College's teaching, learning, research and extension in the field of veterinary medicine, the North Carolina Veterinary Medical Foundation operates exclusively for educational and scientific purposes. By providing financial assistance that helps promote educational activities and maintain a prominent faculty, the Foundation encourages diverse research and facilitates cooperative activities with other disciplines and institutions. The Foundation is ever mindful of maximizing giving power through special programs that bring together donors of similar interests. The Foundation has been critical in securing financial assistance for the College that allows for faculty support and development, research funds, student scholarships and program enhancement.
