Hope For The Hungry is an interdenominational ministry focusing on assisting children worldwide, and serving missionaries who have responded to God's call. We exist to make a substantial contribution toward 'Sharing the Bread of Life with a Starving World.' That entails meeting both the spiritual and physical needs that exist among the people God has called us to serve. We stress that while physical assistance is scripturally mandated, feeding the body without feeding the spirit, ultimately, leads only to death. We also stress that it is essential to the process of world evangelization to work through Christian leaders within the group of people we are striving to reach for Jesus. A good portion of our energies, therefore, is spent in developing and encouraging promising foreign-national Christian leaders.
