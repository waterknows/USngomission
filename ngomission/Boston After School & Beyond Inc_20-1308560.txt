Founded in 2005, Boston After School & Beyond is a public-private partnership that seeks to ensure that every child in Boston has the opportunity to develop to his or her full potential. Boston Beyond's role is to expand learning and skill development opportunities for students. Boston Beyond mobilizes partnerships among program providers, philanthropy, business and higher education, and the City of Boston, especially the Boston Public Schools. Boston Beyond advances student learning by leveraging the strengths of program providers, both large and small, through a coordinated approach to school and community partnerships. This coordinated approach is at the core of every Boston Beyond initiative.
