The Gathering Place (TGP) is metropolitan Denver's only daytime drop-in center for women, children, and transgender individuals who are experiencing homelessness or poverty. In addition to providing a safe refuge, TGP services and programs meet basic needs and provide resources for personal growth. TGP serves some of the most vulnerable in Denver and they tend to face a complex set of circumstances (e.g., unsafe living situations, physical or mental health issues, disabilities, lack of access to resources or technology). To meet as many needs as possible, TGP is many things to many people. To the mother interested in earning a GED, TGP is a place to study while her kids play in the family area. To the artist who needs to earn some cash, TGP is The Card Project. To the woman dealing with health issues and barely able to make ends meet, TGP is a trusted source for nutritious meals. To the newly homeless woman, TGP is a safe refuge where she can begin to rebuild.
