The Albert Baker Fund serves the Cause of Christian Science and mankind by providing resources for the education of Christian Scientists. The Fund was started in 1964 by Christian Scientists living in Boston, Massachusetts, and in Northern California. They created a fund which provided low-cost loans for American college students. Each student was expected to repay the loan over 10 years, replenishing the fund for future generations. They named the fund after Albert Baker, the older brother of Mary Baker Eddy, who is credited with shepherding her education. In addition to college, graduate, and vocational education, we also fund Christian Science nurses training, youth leadership activities such as DiscoveryBound's National Leadership Council for high school students, and scholarships for summer interns working at The Mother Church.
