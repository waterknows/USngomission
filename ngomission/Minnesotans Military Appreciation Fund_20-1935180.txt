Minnesotans' Military Appreciation Fund (MMAF) is a statewide fundraising initiative by the citizens of Minnesota, for Minnesota military personnel and their families. The mission of MMAF is to say "thanks" to Minnesota Service members and their families who are making sacrifices in the defense of our freedoms in combat zones around the world. We aim to show our troops how much we appreciate and respect their efforts by providing cash grants to all service members deployed in combat zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, and to the families of service members who are killed in combat.
