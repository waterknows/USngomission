Hope 4 Kids International is committed to serving impoverished children by leading teams on exciting two-week missions equipped with essential medical and dental supplies and other provisions. Hope 4 Kids International strives to restore the dignity stripped away from innocent children that are suffering through extreme poverty and disease. We are committed to providing access to clean water in every community we serve along with providing relief to poverty-stricken villages caught up in the global AIDS crisis by building hospitals, medical and dental clinics and establishing emergency medical funds. Hope 4 Kids International sponsors over 2,500 AIDS orphans and vulnerable children in these communities.
