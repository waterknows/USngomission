Since its founding in 1876, Grove City College (GCC), committed to Christian principles, has striven to be equal in academic quality to the finest four year colleges. It seeks to provide liberal and professional education of the highest quality that is within the reach of families with modest means who desire a college that will strengthen their children's spiritual and moral character. GCC insists that all its graduates possess, in addition to specialized knowledge in major or professional fields, a high level of cultural literacy and communication skills. Students are required to complete 38-50 credit hours of general education courses with emphases in the humanities, social sciences, quantitative and logical reasoning, laboratory sciences, and foreign language. This program of studies insures that GCC graduates have the marks of educated persons, whatever their profession.
