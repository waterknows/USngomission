For people and wildlife, Conservation Northwest connects and protects old growth and other wild areas from the Washington Coast to the BC Rockies. Founded in 1989, we've protected hundreds of thousands of acres of wildlife habitat: from the big tree forests south of Mount Rainier to huge tracts of forest in the Loomis next to North Cascades National Park. We collaborate with local communities, build science-based solutions, and lead innovative partnerships. Today we are ensuring the region is wild enough for wolves, grizzly bears, and mountain caribou; working with local communities to create sustainable timber jobs and wilderness; and creating safe passage for wildlife across Interstate 90, to name a few.
