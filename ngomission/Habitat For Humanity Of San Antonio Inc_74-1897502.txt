Habitat for Humanity of San Antonio (HFHSA) is an ecumenical Christian housing organization working in partnership with God's people in need to build simple, decent and affordable houses without interest or profit, thereby witnessing God's love in action. We work with very low-income families whose total income is generally 25% - 60% of the area median income. Families are accepted to the Habitat program based on their need, ability to pay a 0% interest mortgage, and their willingness to partner. Applicants must be residents of Bexar County. Families spend a minimum of 300 hours investing in "sweat equity" where they support and help build their own house and that of their neighbors. Monthly mortgage payments average $375 to $425.
