The mission of Gilda's Club is to create welcoming communities of free support for everyone living with cancer - men, women, teens and children - along with their families and friends. Our innovative program is an essential complement to medical care, providing networking and support groups, workshops, education and social activities. Gilda's Club Westchester focuses on the whole family -- children, teens, siblings, aunts, uncles, mothers, fathers, grandparents and extended family and friends. Anyone touched by cancer -- any type of cancer -- is welcome to walk through our red doors in search of support, information and camaraderie.
