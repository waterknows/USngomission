Point Foundation empowers promising lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) students to achieve their full academic and leadership potential - despite the obstacles often put before them - to make a significant impact on society. Since its inception in 2001, Point Foundation has invested more than $15 million in the education and support of over 220 outstanding Point Scholars. Point achieves its mission through scholarship grants, leadership training and individual mentoring programs.  Point's work is vital because nearly one-third of LGBTQ students drop out of high school to escape the violence, harassment, and isolation they face there - a dropout rate nearly three times the national average - and, as a result, are twice as likely to report they are not planning to pursue a higher education.
