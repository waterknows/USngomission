The International Women's Health Coalition (IWHC) promotes and protects the sexual and reproductive rights and health of all women and young people, particularly in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, by helping to develop effective health and population policies, programs, and funding. We advocate and motivate social, political and corporate leaders to enact policy and provide funding for women's rights and health. We provide grants and forge professional partnerships with local leaders as they build organizations to secure women's rights and health. We mobilize women and young people, enabling them to take action to secure their rights, health and well-being. We analyze and communicate facts and path breaking ideas for policy improvement to powerbrokers, health professionals, influentials and other advocates.
