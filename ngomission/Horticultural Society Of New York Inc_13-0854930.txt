Founded in 1900, incorporated in 1902, The Horticultural Society of New York (HSNY) enhances New York City's environmental and cultural life by providing unique educational, vocational and therapeutic outreach programs, library resources and exhibitions. HSNY has evolved into a multidisciplinary cultural and social service resource for the people of New York. HSNY is at the forefront of New York City's and the nation's growing focus on environmental concerns, green technology and urban agriculture; our interconnected programs promote the art and science of horticulture, and its vital role in contemporary life, to diverse communities across the five boroughs.
