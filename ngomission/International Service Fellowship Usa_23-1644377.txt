The American mission of InterServe was founded in 1860. InterServe USA is part of an international and interdenominational fellowship of Christians committed to each other and in partnership for service to the people of the Arab World and Asia. We are made up of Christian professionals and highly trained personnel who use their professional skills to minister holistically to the physical, emotional, and spiritual needs of the people they serve. InterServe is made up of branches in 19 countries who send cross-cultural workers to countries in Northern Africa, the Middle East and Asia. We work in partnership with other agencies to ensure the work of our partners reach those who need it the most.
