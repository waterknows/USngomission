The Union Rescue Mission (URM) has been the primary service provider to the homeless, domestically abused woman and children and the desperate addict for nearly 60 years. Our mission is to provide an environment where the love and compassion of Jesus Christ can help people overcome and prevent life's adversities. We have the Dorcas House that provides a 9 month long residential program for women and children coming out of domestic violence situations, as well as, a program for women needing drug and alcohol treatment.For the men, the Nehemiah House provides a drug and alcohol program, a work program for working homeless men and a homeless shelter.
