The Make-A-Wish Foundation of Massachusetts and Rhode Island grants wishes for children with life-threatening medical conditions between the ages of 2Â½ and 18 to enrich the human experience with hope, strength, and joy. Every year, approximately 500 Massachusetts and Rhode Island children are newly diagnosed with a serious illness and newly eligible for a wish. Our ultimate goal is to grant wishes for every medically eligible child in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. The joy began in 1987, when the Make-A-Wish Foundation of Massachusetts and Rhode Island fulfilled its very first wish. Since that first inspired wish, we have served over 4,000 seriously ill children throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and State of Rhode Island. We have grown from granting a single wish in our first year to serving over 309 children annually.
