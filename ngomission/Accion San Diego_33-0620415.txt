The mission of ACCION San Diego is to create increased income and access to jobs for low-to-moderate income, self-employed men and women by providing small loans and business support services. Building upon the experience of ACCION International, ACCION San Diego developed a successful lending methodology in 1994 tailored to local micro-entrepreneurs in Southern California's neighborhoods. With economic opportunity, these entrepreneurs can build assets and better provide for their families and communities. ACCION San Diego currently assists small business owners in San Diego County.
