Incorporated in 1985, the mission of Make-A-Wish Foundation of Utah is to grant the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions to enrich the human experience with hope, strength, and joy. The Make-A-Wish Foundation of Utah provides a wish to all Utah children between 2 1/2 and 17 (at the time of referral) whose physicians affirm that they have a life-threatening condition. A wish is a critically ill child's answer to the question, "If you could have anything in the world, go anywhere, be or do anything, what would you choose? What would you do?" The Utah chapter grants over 140 wishes a year to Utah children. That's giving hope to a lot of young people and their families.
