Since 1945, the Nantucket Boys & Girls Club has been helping kids succeed. The Club is a caring, creative resource. We offer kids challenge balanced with encouragement and praise…room for growth grounded in a sense of security and connections…and opportunities for individual expression reinforced with validation and support. The Club is a place where young people come to learn, do homework, develop social skills, express themselves creatively, and participate in sports. As young people experience the totality of the Club, a safe place, ongoing relationships with caring adults and life enhancing programs the Nantucket Boys & Girls Club becomes a place of hope and opportunity and truly a positive place for kids.
