Founded in 1965, the South Dakota Symphony Orchestra celebrates the tradition of live orchestral music and enriches the lives of people throughout our region. We present full, chamber, and ensemble orchestra concerts, as well as education programs for all ages. Additionally, we initiate and encourage collaborations with statewide business and arts organizations to promote the arts in general.
