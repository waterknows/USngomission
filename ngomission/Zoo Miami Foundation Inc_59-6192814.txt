The Zoological Society of Florida (ZSF), founded in 1956, is the nonprofit support organization for Miami Metrozoo. Metrozoo houses more than 1,300 wild animals in a cageless setting that closely approximates the animals' natural habitats and gives the visitor the feeling of embarking on an international safari. Today, the ZSF is one of the largest membership organizations in South Florida with activities and programs that include: volunteer services, education programs, special events, and member programs. The ZSF's mission is to encourage an appreciation for the world's wildlife and to help conserve it for future generations.
