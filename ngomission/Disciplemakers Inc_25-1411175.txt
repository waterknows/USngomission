Founded in 1981, DiscipleMakers is a Pennsylvania-based Christian mission organization ministering to college students. DiscipleMakers seeks to fulfill the Great Commission of Jesus Christ on college campuses through Biblically based training in evangelism and discipleship. We exist to help students discover the only answers to their questions that will ultimately satisfy them and prepare them for the realities of this life and the next. DiscipleMakers believes these answers are found in the Bible which records the history of God's redemptive plan, culminating in the person of Jesus Christ. Our strategy is based on the belief that colleges and universities are critical places to make the kind of disciples that can change the world for Christ.
