The Monmouth County SPCA (MCSPCA) protects and advocates for all animals. We are dedicated to enforcing animal cruelty laws; providing a safe haven for homeless, abused and abandoned pets while they await adoption; reducing pet over-population through spay/neutering; and cultivating their humane treatment through education and service as a valuable community resource. The Monmouth County SPCA not only finds homes for stray dogs and cats, but also those family pets that can no longer be cared for by their owners. All of the animals (strays and previously owned pets) placed for adoption receive the same excellent care. The MCSPCA is committed to preventing cruelty to animals, and we see to it that a human being responsible for cruelty to an animal is brought to justice.
