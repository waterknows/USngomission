Since 1892, Wellspring Family Services has been helping area families achieve self-sufficiency. Our services have changed over the years, but our commitment to a stronger, healthier community has never wavered. Wellspring Family Services builds emotionally healthy, self-sufficient families and a non-violent community in which they can thrive. Last year we served more than 7,000 children, adults and families in King County. By addressing the overlapping issues of mental health challenges, domestic violence, and homelessness we help strengthen our community by providing families with the solutions they need to build healthy relationships and stable lives.
