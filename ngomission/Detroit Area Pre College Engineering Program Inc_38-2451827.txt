DAPCEP (Detroit Area Pre-College Engineering Program) works to increase the number of historically underrepresented students who are motivated and prepared academically to pursue degrees leading to careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) related fields through K-12 supplemental educational programming. During the fall and spring, students attend courses that take place over 5 consecutive Saturdays on university, professional, and community campuses. In the summer, students attend commuter or residential camp at Michigan universities, gaining exciting exposure to college life! We also offer in-school programming at select schools.
