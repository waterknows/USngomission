American Kidney Fund (AKF) was founded in 1971, to help a single individual with kidney failure pay for dialysis. More than 40 years later, AKF has become the leading source of direct financial aid to dialysis patients across the nation. The American Kidney Fund leads the nation in providing charitable assistance to dialysis patients who need help with the costs associated with treating kidney failure. In 2012, nearly 84,000 people--1 out of every 5 dialysis patients in the United States--received assistance from the American Kidney Fund for health insurance premiums and other treatment-related expenses. Millions of people nationwide benefit annually from the American Kidney Fund's efforts to fight kidney disease through public awareness campaigns, free health screenings, health education materials and courses, online outreach, and toll-free health information HelpLine (866-300-2900).
