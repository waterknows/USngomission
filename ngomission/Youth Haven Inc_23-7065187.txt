Incorporated in 1969, Youth Haven is the only emergency shelter for children in Collier County. Since inception, we have provided a home for thousands of neglected and/or abused children in desperate need of protection -ages birth through eleven, 24-hours a day, seven days a week, without exception. While our roots remain grounded in emergency shelter care, our campus flourishes not only with an on-site day care center for low-income working families, but also an array of pioneering child and substance abuse prevention initiatives to families at risk of abusing their children. Youth Haven works to create an exceptional experience that has the power to transform the lives of vulnerable children and families.
