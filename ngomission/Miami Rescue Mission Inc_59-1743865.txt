Miami Rescue Mission has been serving the homeless and needy of South Florida since 1922. It is our mission to reach out to the least, the last, and the lost of our community to inspire hope with human compassion and the love of God. We empower men, women and children to become successful in life, reunite families, restore lives, find employment, acquire housing, and build new futures. Our doors are open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year to provide food, clothing and shelter, along with recovery programs and education for those who want to change their lives. Our ministries include the Center for Men, a Community Activity Center, the Center for Women and Children, and the Jeffrey A. Tew Education Center. Thrift Stores provide gift-in-kind as well as revenue for our programs. The Mission also operates centers in Hollywood and Pompano Beach (Broward County). Over 1,300 men, women, and children are helped each day.
