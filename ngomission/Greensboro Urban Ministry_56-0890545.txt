The mission of Greensboro Urban Ministry is to express the love of God to people in need in the Greater Greensboro area. To accomplish this mission, Greensboro Urban Ministry works to meet the needs of individuals in crisis in our community. Whether through food, housing, employment, or case management assistance, we meet these individuals where they are and work with them to rebuild. With their cooperation, input, and support to ensure success, Greensboro Urban Ministry provides the tools and support needed until they can again become self-sufficient.
