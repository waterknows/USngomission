The Center for Resilient Cities designs proactive strategies that help urban communities and leaders enhance their current resources and prepare for the future. We build robust and thriving urban communities that are healthy, just, economically viable, and environmentally sound. We envision a world of resilient cities filled with clean water, clean air, green landscapes, sustainable and just food systems, and healthy people in economically thriving neighborhoods.
