Founded in 1993, the mission of The Myositis Association (TMA) is to find a cure for inflammatory and other related myopathies, while serving those affected by these diseases. The aim of TMA's programs and services is to provide information, support, advocacy and research for those concerned about myositis. Myositis is the general term for swelling of the muscles. Inflammatory myopathies are thought to be autoimmune diseases, meaning the body's immune system, which normally fights infections and viruses, is misdirected and attacks the body's own normal, healthy tissue through inflammation, or swelling.
