The Corporation for Jefferson's Poplar Forest was formed in December 1983 by a group of individuals to lead the rescue of Jefferson's endangered retreat for the cultural and educational benefit of the public - now and for future generations. In January 1984 the Corporation succeeded in taking title to a 50-acre parcel of land which was all that remained with the original buildings at the heart of Jefferson's original plantation. The ongoing land rescue, archaeological exploration, and restoration is made possible entirely through donations to The Corporation for Jefferson's Poplar Forest. Our mission is to preserve and restore Thomas Jefferson's retreat so that it can serve the public as an innovative educational catalyst inspiring insight into the past, present, and future.
