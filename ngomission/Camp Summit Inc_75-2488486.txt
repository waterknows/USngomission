Camp Summit was created in 1993 to assume management of the residential camping program for people with disabilities, established by Soroptimist International of Dallas in 1947. The mission of Camp Summit is to provide barrier-free outdoor experiences that promote personal growth and foster independence for children and adults with disabilities. Our campers range in age from six to adulthood and may be developmentally delayed, physically challenged, dual sensory impaired (deaf and blind) or have multiple disabilities. Our programming consists of 1 weeklong spring break camp, 11 one-week summer camping sessions and 9 one-week fall camp sessions. Plus weekend sessions and respite days are offered in the spring and fall.
