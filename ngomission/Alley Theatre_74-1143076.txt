The Alley Theatre, founded in 1947, exists to provide audiences with the highest quality theatre, offering a wide variety of work including new plays, classics, the re-discovered and the rarely-performed, and new musical theatre, with an emphasis on new American works - to provide the inspirational and the provocative - to make our audiences think, feel, dream and be entertained. Alley Theatre Center for Theatre Production, a 75,000 square foot facility adjacent to our two main theatres, is home to our educational programs, where we connect with the youth of the city and state - our future audience and future artists - through programs such as From Stage to Page, HYPE (Houston Young Playwrights Exchange) and the Young Performers Studio.
