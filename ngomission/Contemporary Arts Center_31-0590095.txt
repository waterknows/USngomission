Founded in 1939 as the Modern Art Society, the Contemporary Arts Center (CAC) was one of the first institutions in the U.S. dedicated to contemporary art. The CAC is a non-collecting institution that focuses on new developments in painting, sculpture, photography, architecture, performance art and new media. We remain committed to showcasing contemporary art and artists relevant to diverse audience, and developing programming that examines and reflects the importance of the art we exhibit. In addition, the CAC's Education Department makes the CAC exhibitions accessible to the widest possible audience by providing interpretive and entertaining information in a variety of forms and through special programs for children and adults.
