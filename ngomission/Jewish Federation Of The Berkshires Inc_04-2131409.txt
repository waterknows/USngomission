Founded in 1954 and guided by our Jewish values, the Jewish Federation of the Berkshires brings together the Berkshire Jewish community to leverage its resources to care for Jews in need here and abroad, assure the continuity of the Jewish people, support a secure State of Israel, and mobilize on issues of concern to the local Berkshire community.
