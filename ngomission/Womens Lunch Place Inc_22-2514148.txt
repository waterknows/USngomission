Since 1982, thousands of women in Greater Boston have found refuge and welcome at Women's Lunch Place. Women's Lunch Place provides a safe, comfortable day time shelter, nutritious food, and vital services for women experiencing homelessness or poverty. We treat women with dignity and respect, and foster a community committed to meeting each woman's needs. We are open six days a week, year-round, to serve anyone who identifies as a woman, with no requirements to receive any service. In the words of one guest, "I was half a person in the street and they put me together."
