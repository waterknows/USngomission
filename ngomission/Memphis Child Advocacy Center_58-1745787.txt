Our mission is to serve children who are victims of sexual and severe physical abuse through prevention, education and intervention. Our vision is a community where children are safe, families are strong, and victims become children again. When an allegation of child sexual abuse or severe physical abuse has been made, the Memphis Child Advocacy Center provides a warm and caring atmosphere for children and their families to receive coordinated services. These include counseling, interviews, and a team review. In this child-focused environment, representatives from many disciplines make decisions about investigation, treatment, and prosecution of child abuse cases.
