Since its first campaign in 1940, when San Antonio business leaders banded together to raise funds for those in need in our community, United Way of San Antonio and Bexar County has become synonymous with caring and helping children, families and individuals. It remains the largest and most respected private health and human service organization in Bexar County, supporting 110 high-quality programs at 60 agencies. Now, United Way is engaging the community to get to the heart of problems. Here in San Antonio, United Way focuses on three critical areas - improving early care and education for children, strengthening families to become more financially stable and developing individual capacity for success.
