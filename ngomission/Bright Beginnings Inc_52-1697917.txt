Bright Beginnings was established in 1991 and is today a nationally-accredited child and family development center that offers a bright start for homeless infants, toddlers and preschoolers and their families. Bright Beginnings serves about 186 children annually whose families are living in crisis shelters or transitional housing. Their educational, therapeutic, health and family support services prepares these children for kindergarten and stabilizes their families so ultimately they can make the transition out of homelessness. Bright Beginnings' vision is that their leadership and programming will restore and revitalize the quality of life for every homeless child and family in Washington, DC.
