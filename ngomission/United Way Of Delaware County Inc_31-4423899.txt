Founded in 1971, the United Way of Delaware County (UWDC) is in the business of creating meaningful and tangible impact in our community. We are focused on education through programs and services that help children and youth achieve their potential. UWDC works to create access to quality child care and early childhood education. They help to support youth mentoring programs and scouting programs that develop tolerance, diversity and conflict resolution. They provide advocacy for abused and neglected children, and support for school children who are at risk due to substance abuse within their families.
