Reynolda House preserves and interprets an American country home and a premiere collection of American art ranging from the colonial period to the present. Built in 1917 by Katharine Smith Reynolds and her husband Richard Joshua Reynolds, founder of the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, the house originally occupied the center of a 1,067-acre estate. It opened to the public as an institution dedicated to the arts and education in 1965, and as an art museum in 1967. Masterpieces from three centuries of painting and sculpture make up Reynolda's renowned collection. The collection is extraordinary for its quality and provides audiences with a thorough survey of major developments in American art in a warm and welcoming setting.Affiliated with Wake Forest University, Reynolda House features changing exhibitions, concerts, lectures, classes, film screenings and other events. Adjacent Reynolda Gardens and Reynolda Village feature a spectacular public garden, dining, shopping and trails.
