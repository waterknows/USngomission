Ronald McDonald House Charities of Rochester reaches out to the community to promote the health and well-being of children and their families by providing a home away from home for families whose children are receiving medical treatment at area medical facilities. Families are stronger when they are together, and their presence helps a sick child heal faster and cope better. While Ronald McDonald House CharitiesÂ® cannot make medicine taste better or take away painful treatments, we can help lessen the burden and ensure families have the stability and resources to keep their child healthy and happy. Last year, Ronald McDonald House Charities of Rochester, NY, supported more than 900 families and children, all because of the love and generous donations of our donors and volunteers.
