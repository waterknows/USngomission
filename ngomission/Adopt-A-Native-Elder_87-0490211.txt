The Adopt-A-Native-Elder Program supports the traditional Elders who live in the cultural and spiritual traditions of The Dine' (Navajo) People. Most live in remote portions of the Dine's reservation. The Program provides food, simple medicines, clothing, fabric and yarns to help these Elders live on the land in their traditional lifestyle. As they have become elderly, it has become more difficult for them to support themselves on the Land in their traditional ways. The Program supports 500 traditional Elders who live in the Northern portion of Arizona and Southern Utah.
