At Our Piece of the Pie (OPP), we believe that with access and opportunity, all youth can succeed. With the mission to help urban youth become successful adults, OPP has successfully structured its programs and services to lead at-risk or disadvantaged youth, ages 14-24, toward the goals of achieving a college degree or vocational credentials and/or obtaining rewarding post-education employment. Through innovative methods, OPP seeks to re-engage disconnected youth and help them find a realistic pathway to success.
