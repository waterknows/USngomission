The Food Bank of Corpus Christi solicits and distributes food that might otherwise go to waste or be discarded by manufacturers, wholesalers or retailers. Since 1982, the Food Bank has been fighting hunger in the Coastal Bend by providing food and personal care products to various charity and service agencies in an eleven county area including Aransas, Bee, Brooks, Duval, Jim Wells, Kenedy, Kleberg, Live Oak, McMullen, Nueces and San Patricio counties. As one of only two food banks in the state certified by H-E-B to receive perishable goods, the Food Bank is able to store and distribute perishable items such as meat, produce and dairy products. USDA products are also dispensed to agencies that qualify to receive government commodities. It is estimated that 19,000 people eat food from the Food Bank on any given week.
