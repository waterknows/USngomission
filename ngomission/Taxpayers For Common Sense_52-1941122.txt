Founded in 1995, Taxpayers for Common Sense is a 501(c)3 nonpartisan budget watchdog that serves as an independent voice for American taxpayers. Our mission is to ensure that the federal government spends taxpayer dollars responsibly and operates within its means. Through our investigations, public data sets, and online outreach, we highlight government waste, propose solutions, and provide opportunities for people to make their voices heard in Washington. We work with elected officials from across the spectrum, sound alarm in the media, and assist grassroots partners to propose common sense solutions to wasteful spending.
