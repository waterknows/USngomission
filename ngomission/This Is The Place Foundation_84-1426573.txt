This Is The Place Foundation operates and maintains This Is The Place Heritage Park. The Park Interprets Utah's pioneer heritage by recreating history in a pioneer village dated from 1840 to 1869. Heritage Village includes over 40 historical buildings and thousands of artifacts. The village also holds events that are interpreted by volunteers and staff. One of the historical buildings in the village is the Brigham Young Farm House that was built in 1863 on the Mormon leader's 823- acre farm. The village also includes This Is The Place Monument which marks the spot where the Mormon Pioneers first entered the Salt Lake Valley and marks the end of the 1,300-mile Mormon trail.
