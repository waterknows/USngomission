Founded in 1983, The Wooden Floor's mission is to empower low-income youth from diverse backgrounds to strengthen self-esteem, self-discipline and a sense of accomplishment through dance, academic, and family programs. From our Santa Ana campus, The Wooden Floor annually gives under-served local youth the tools to live fuller, healthier lives through a unique approach grounded in dance. We make a long-term investment in each of these young people. They engage in intensive dance education supported by academic and family services that change the way they make decisions, helping them to discover and pursue their full potential.
