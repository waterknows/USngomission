United Way of McLean County is a volunteer led organization that advances the common good by concentrating on three key issues that are the building blocks for a good life: Education, Income and Health. Our role is to connect people, resources and ideas to create a thriving community characterized by educational success, financial stability, and healthy people. We work with local volunteers and community partners to identify and develop innovative solutions to local issues. Collaboration, cooperation and partnership are the keys to our success. UWMC invites and connects people and organizations that bring passion, expertise and resources needed to get things done. It takes everyone working together to create community-wide change.
