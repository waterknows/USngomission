The Retina Foundation of the Southwest (RFSW), founded in 1982, has grown into one of the leading independent vision research centers in the United States, with a staff dedicated to finding the causes, treatments and potential cures for blinding eye diseases. The mission of RFSW is to prevent and restore vision loss through innovative research and treatment. Our scientists use the power of modern technology to understand the intricacy of retinal function and conduct studies of hereditary and acquired blinding retinal disorders, including retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration. Other studies address eye disorders affecting the sight of infants and children, including hereditary eye diseases, cataracts, prematurity and the consequences of eye muscle imbalance.
