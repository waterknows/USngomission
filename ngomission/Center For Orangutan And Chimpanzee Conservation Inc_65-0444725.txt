Center for Great Apes, founded in 1993, provides a permanent sanctuary for orangutans and chimpanzees who have been retired from the entertainment industry, from research, or who are no longer wanted as pets. The Center provides care with dignity in a safe, healthy, and enriching environment for great apes in need of lifetime care. Our sanctuary home is located in Wauchula, on over 100 acres a few miles from the beautiful Peace River in south central Florida. Routine health checks, periodic physicals, and when necessary, emergency care are handled in the Arcus Great Ape Health Center.
