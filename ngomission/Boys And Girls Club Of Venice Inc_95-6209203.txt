Established in 1968, The Boys & Girls Club of Venice is one of over 4,300 Boys & Girls Clubs nationwide. Upholding national guidelines for program content, delivery and quality, a growing number of Boys & Girls Clubs now provide programs over three million youth across our country and in military bases overseas. We enable all young people, especially those who need us most, to reach their full potential as productive, caring, responsible citizens.
