Founded in 1979, Camp Good Days and Special Times is dedicated to improving the quality of life for children, adults and families whose lives have been touched by cancer and other life challenges. All of the programs and services provided by Camp Good Days are offered free of charge for the participants. Camp Good Days provides residential camping programs at our beautiful recreational facility, located on the shores of Keuka Lake in Branchport, New York, as well as year-round recreational and support activities, in the Rochester, Buffalo & Syracuse, New York and Central Florida areas for the entire family. At Camp Good Days, participants have the opportunity to regain some of what cancer, sickle cell anemia, HIV/AIDS, or violence has taken away from them.
