Founded in 1976, the Institute for Foreign Policy Analysis (IFPA) is an independent, nonpartisan research organization specializing in national security, foreign policy, and defense planning issues. We help senior government policy makers, industry leaders, and officials in the public policy community make informed decisions in a dynamic and unpredictable global security environment. The Institute identifies global and regional trends and assesses their implications for policy planners; translates policy options into concrete program decisions; designs strategic plans for government and industry clients; and establishes strategic partnerships with industry, think tanks, academia and government. IFPA is associated with The Fletcher School, Tufts University.
