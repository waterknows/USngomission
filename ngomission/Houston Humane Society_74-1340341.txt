The Houston Humane Society (HHS) is dedicated to eliminating cruelty, abuse, and the overpopulation of animals. HHS provides a wide variety of animal welfare programs to Houston area residents and their pets, including pet adoptions, humane education, and Houston's only $30 spay/neuter clinic that is open to the general public. HHS' R.A.I.D.E.R. Program investigates reports of neglect, abandonment or mistreatment of both companion animals and livestock in accordance with Texas state law. Our R.A.I.D.E.R. Investigators work non-stop to rescue animals in these conditions.
