Sheltering Wings provides emergency housing for women and children suffering from any form of domestic abuse. We build stable and independent lives through essential programs offered in a supportive and Christ-centered environment. We provide a safe, 24-hour haven for women and their dependent children suffering the effects of domestic violence. We help victims of domestic violence build stable and independent lives through case management and mentoring programs. We address the physical and emotional needs of children who have witnessed or suffered abuse through crisis intervention, positive support, and education in healthy relationships. We strive to break the cycle of domestic violence by educating our community on its realities, actions they can take in response and resources available to those in unhealthy relationships.
