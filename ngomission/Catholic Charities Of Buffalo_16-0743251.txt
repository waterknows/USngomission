Catholic Charities of Buffalo is a Catholic sponsored human service agency serving anyone in need in the eight counties of Western New York. Believing all persons are created by God, we empower individuals, children, families and couple to achieve and maintain meaningful, healthy and productive lives. We advocate for those in need, particularly those who are poor and most vulnerable. We offer an array of mission-focused programs including comprehensive counseling services for all ages, basic emergency assistance, mental health services, chemical dependency treatment, educational and job readiness services, services to the older adult, parish based outreach, marriage counseling, foster care services, adoption, adult day care, and a variety of programs that address prevention and treatment of a number of family issues. In 2012, Catholic Charities served more than 130,000 Western New Yorkers without regard to age, race or religion.
