IHCF (International Health Care Foundation) African Christian Hospitals exists to support medical mission points which we are involved with on an ongoing basis and to begin new mission points when opportunities are right. We are currently involved in five medical works in West Africa. We operate a clinic and two hospitals in Nigeria. In Ghana, we work with two clinics, one in the northern part of the country and one in the south. IHCF African Christian Hospitals also hosts a medical missions seminar each January in Dallas. This is the largest and oldest medical missions conference in the Church of Christ fellowship. Many organizations, ministries, and individuals working around the globe attend to share ideas, information and fellowship.
