The United Way of the Laurel Highlands is working to advance the common good by focusing on the building blocks for a good life - Education, Income and Health. United Way agencies serve one out of every three families in Cambria and Somerset Counties by connecting those who need help with the right services and support. Victims of domestic violence are given shelter and the strength they need to build a new life. At-risk youth receive mentoring and guidance to make better life choices. Seniors find caring and support. Families in crisis find housing, food, and a helping hand.

 

Our major focus is to create long-lasting changes that prevent problems from happening in the first place. We bring together people from all across the community to tackle the issues. We all win when a child succeeds in school, when a family becomes financially stable, and when people have good health.
