Shelburne Farms is a membership-supported environmental education center and National Historic Landmark on the shores of Lake Champlain in Shelburne, Vermont. Our mission is to cultivate a conservation ethic. Schoolchildren, adults, educators and families come here to learn, while casual visitors may enjoy the walking trails, children's farmyard, inn, restaurant, property tours and special events. Founded in 1972, the farm practices rural land use that is environmentally, economically and culturally sustainable.
