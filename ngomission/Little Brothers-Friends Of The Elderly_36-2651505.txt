Since 1959 Little Brothers - Friends of the Elderly Chicago Chapter (LBFE), has brought companionship and social interaction to isolated and lonely elders. LBFE Chicago is part of a national network of volunteer-based organizations committed to relieving isolation and loneliness among the elderly. We offer to people of goodwill the opportunity to join the elderly in friendship and celebration of life. Programs offered by LBFE Chicago include visiting programs, holiday celebrations, year-round celebrations, vacation programs and inter generational programs, among others. In 2013 year we served 1,340 elders, with the indispensable help of volunteers giving more than 39,000 hours of their time.
