Founded in 1921, the Heart of Illinois United Way brings together people from business, labor, government, health and human services to address our community's needs. Money raised through the Heart of Illinois United Way campaign stays in our community funding programs and services in Marshall, Peoria, Putnam, Stark, Tazewell and Woodford Counties. We focus on these key issues: education-related programs, income-related programs, and health-related programs.
