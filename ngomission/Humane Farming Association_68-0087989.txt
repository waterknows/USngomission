The Humane Farming Association (HFA) is the nation's largest farm animal protection organization. Founded in 1985, HFA is leading the campaign against factory farming and slaughterhouse abuses. HFA is also home to the world's largest farm animal refuge, Suwanna Ranch. HFA's goals are to protect farm animals from cruelty, to protect the public from the dangerous misuse of antibiotics, hormones, and other chemicals used on factory farms, and to protect the environment from the impacts of industrialized animal factories. HFA's comprehensive programs include: anti-cruelty investigations and exposes, national media and ad campaigns, direct hands-on emergency care, and refuge for abused farm animals.
