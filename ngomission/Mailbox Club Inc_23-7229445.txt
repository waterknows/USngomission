The Mailbox Club's mission is to win the children and young people of the world to Christ, and help nurture them into spiritual maturity through Bible correspondence courses and into local churches. This is accomplished through direct ministry and by multiplying our efforts through key partnerships and the Body of Christ around the world. The Mailbox Club facilitates translation, production and distribution of Mailbox Club lessons around the world for people of all ages, with particular emphasis on children and young people.
