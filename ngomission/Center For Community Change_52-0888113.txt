Founded in 1968, the Center for Community Change strengthens, connects and mobilizes grassroots groups to enhance their leadership, voice and power. We believe that vibrant community-based organizations, led by the people most affected by social and economic injustice, are key to putting an end to the failed go-it-alone politics of the past and building a better America for everyone based on community values. The Center is one of the longest-standing champions for low-income people and communities of color. We amplify community voices, combine grassroots power to win, and build the social movements of tomorrow.
