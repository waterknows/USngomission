For more than three decades, Walk Thru the Bible has created discipleship materials that are reaching millions of people all over the world through live seminar events, print publications, devotional materials, small group resources, and the Internet. As a community of committed Jesus-followers, we are helping people everywhere live God's Word. Together with our donors, staff, international partners, and volunteers, we show those who are spiritually hungry where to find the Bread of Life as we point them to the Way, the Truth, and the Life - Jesus Christ. Our goal is to be a global catalyst for discipleship in every nation. Walk Thru the Bible has partnerships with in-country nationals and high-impact local churches, as well as alliances with other international ministries.
