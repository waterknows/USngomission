Founded in 1944, the Jewish Council for Public Affairs (JCPA) works to serve as the representative voice of the organized American Jewish community in addressing the principal mandate of the Jewish community relations field, expressed in three interrelated goals: to safeguard the rights of Jews here and around the world;

to dedicate ourselves to the safety and security of the state of Israel; and to protect, preserve and promote a just American society, one that is democratic and pluralistic, one that furthers harmonious interreligious, inter ethnic interracial and other intergroup relations.
