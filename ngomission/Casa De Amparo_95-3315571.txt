Established in 1978, Casa de Amparo's mission is to support those affected by and at risk of child abuse and neglect through a range of programs and services that promote healing, growth and healthy relationships. Casa de Amparo is recognized as a major force in the field of child abuse prevention. Partnering with the greater San Diego community, we assure that children and their families receive unique and innovative services for healing, for stopping child mistreatment of any kind, and for ending generational cycles of abuse. The result is a community where child abuse and neglect are not tolerated, and where child abuse awareness and prevention are priorities.
