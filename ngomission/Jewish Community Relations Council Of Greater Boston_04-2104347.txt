Founded in 1944, The Jewish Community Relations Council (JCRC) works to define and advance the values, interests and priorities of the organized Jewish community of Greater Boston in the public square. To achieve our shared values effectively, JCRC and the Greater Boston Jewish community work toward a strong infrastructure of community relations, articulated through building our community's connection and commitment to civil society, developing the next generation of Jewish leaders, weaving a strong network of Jewish organizations, and investing in deep ties with actors in the public square.
