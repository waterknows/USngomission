Together We Cope bridges the gap for Southland residents in temporary crisis by providing food, shelter, clothing and referrals, empowering them to return to self-sufficiency. In response to the steel mill closings, which hit south suburban residents particularly hard, Oak Forest resident Loraine Cook founded Together We Cope in 1982. For the year 2009 - 2010, Together We Cope provided assistance to 41,000 people. The Financial Assistance Program provided $228,000, the Clothing Program provided $128,000, and the Food Program provided $1,093,000. Our Holiday (Adopt-A-Child for Holiday Gifts) Program and Back-to-School (Supplies) Program each benefitted 1,100 children.
