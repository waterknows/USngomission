Alliance For Children, Tarrant County's Children's Advocacy Center program, is dedicated to the protection and healing of child abuse victims. For over 20 years, we have helped more than 46,000 children heal from the trauma of physical abuse, sexual abuse or from witnessing a violent crime. Alliance For Children is the only Tarrant County non-profit organization involved directly in the protection from child abuse through coordinated and teamed investigations with law enforcement, Child Protective Services, Cook Children's Medical Center and the District Attorney's Office. Our mission is to protect Tarrant County children from child abuse through teamed investigations, healing services and community education. At Alliance For Children, our goal is to minimize the trauma of the abuse so that children and families can begin to heal.
