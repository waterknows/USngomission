At the Boys & Girls Clubs of Larimer County, we provide an environment that helps young people reach their full potential. It is a positive mission that we meet head-on with life-changing programs and a caring, dedicated staff. We are there, every day, when kids are the least supervised and the most vulnerable - the after-school hours from 2:30 to 7:00 M-F, and all day during the summer and other school breaks. At the Clubs, kids learn to work and play together. They are given structure and responsibility. They participate in activities and programs that are so much fun they often don't know they are learning principles and ethics. Their attitudes change, they become more confident, develop character, and learn why it is important to get an education. They are motivated to avoid alcohol, drugs, tobacco, and early sexual experimentation.
