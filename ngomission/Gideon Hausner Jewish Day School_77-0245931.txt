Gideon Hausner Jewish Day School is a kindergarten through eighth grade school founded in 1989. We are committed to promoting academic excellence, community responsibility, and vibrant Jewish living. As a community day school, Hausner serves families from a wide range of Jewish backgrounds and religious practices. Today we enroll close to 400 students and provide an exceptional education in science, math, history, literature, Jewish studies, Hebrew language, music, fine arts, sports, and technology. The academic excellence of our program is built on rigorous standards, exceptional faculty, and small student to teacher ratios.
