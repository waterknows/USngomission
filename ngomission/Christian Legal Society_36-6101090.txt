Founded in 1961, Christian Legal Society (CLS) is the largest non-denominational organization of Christian attorneys, judges, law professors, and law students in the country. We are in over 1,100 cities, all 50 states and 28 foreign countries, working in association with thousands of supportive lay people. CLS' mission is to be the national grassroots network of lawyers and law students committed to proclaiming, loving and serving Jesus Christ through all we do and say in the practice of law, and advocating biblical conflict reconciliation, legal assistance for the poor and the needy, religious freedom and the sanctity of human life.
