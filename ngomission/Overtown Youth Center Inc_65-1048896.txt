Opened in 2003, the mission of the Overtown Youth Center (OYC) is to inspire and empower youth and families by fostering hope through enrichment services. OYC programs are designed to engage children in educational and recreational activities that promote their physical, cognitive, motor, social, and emotional development. After-school services are provided both at our site and within our partner schools and are coordinated closely with in-school services. During the after school hours, students attend daily educational enrichment classes focused on homework assistance, skill building, FCAT preparation, and remediation. Students participate in daily recreational activities that include culturally diverse forms of physical exercise and creative arts.
