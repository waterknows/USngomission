The Food Bank of Western New York obtains food and support from public and private sources. Donated food, deemed "edible but unmarketable" by the food industry, is brought to our facility and redistributed to qualified charitable programs providing food and grocery items to the needy in the four county area of Western, New York. During fiscal year 2010 11,506,590 pounds of food and grocery items were distributed to 333 member agency programs . Each month, they serve nearly 75,000 less fortunate Western New Yorkers in soup kitchens, food pantries, kids cafes, shelters and other emergency food providers. Our vision is to continue to respectfully provide nutritional food, training education and hunger advocacy for our agency programs and their clients empowering them to make healthy lifestyle choices.
