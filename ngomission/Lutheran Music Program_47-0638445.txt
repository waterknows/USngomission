Lutheran Music Program transforms lives and connects people through faith and music. The three values which we embrace are musical excellence, Lutheran faith and a nurturing community. Our vision is to see churches and communities renewed through music for the sake of the world. Founded in 1981, Lutheran Music Program is home to Lutheran Summer Music (LSM), a four-week residential training and performance program. Each summer, LSM brings together 150+ band, orchestra, choir, and keyboard students from the U.S. and abroad in a supportive, intentional community.
