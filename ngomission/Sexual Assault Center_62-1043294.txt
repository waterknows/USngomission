The Sexual Assault Center (S.A.C.) opened its doors in 1978. Today, we are the only place in Middle Tennessee that is exclusively dedicated to providing counseling to child and adult sexual assault victims. In addition, we have programs that educate students on how to recognize and prevent sexual assault. Our counselors are specialists in the field and have worked with more than 20,000 survivors since we opened our doors. Approximately half of our clients are children. With treatment, clients can begin to heal â€“ moving beyond trauma into living healthy, productive lives. We take a holistic approach and work with the entire family. Beyond individual treatment, we offer group therapy sessions for children, teens, men, women, and families of survivors.
