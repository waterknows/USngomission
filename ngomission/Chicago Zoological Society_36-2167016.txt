The mission of the Chicago Zoological Society is to inspire conservation leadership by connecting people with wildlife and nature. Since the opening of Brookfield Zoo in 1934, the Society has had an international reputation for taking a cutting-edge role in animal care and conservation of the natural world. Among its historical firsts are indoor multispecies exhibits, zoo nutrition residencies, methods for animal husbandry, and medical care that includes successful brain surgery for a gorilla. In building its legacy of animal care and compassion, the Society has launched a leadership campaign to create two new centers: the Center for Conservation Leadership and the Center for the Science of Animal Well-Being (CSAW).
