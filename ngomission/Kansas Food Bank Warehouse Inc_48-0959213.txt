The Kansas Food Bank (KFB), which incorporated in 1983 and began operations in 1984, provides comprehensive and compassionate HungerCare whenever and wherever it is needed to safeguard the health, well-being and productivity of food-insecure Kansas families and their children, as well as senior citizens, the homeless and the chronically ill and impoverished among us. KFB serves over 400 agencies in 86 Kansas counties distributing over 4.5 million pounds of food each year. These counties cover more than 73,000 square miles in Kansas. KFB works with other America's Second Harvest agencies to share large quantities of food that any one food bank could not distribute alone.
