Opened in 1926, the Greenwich Country Day School (GCDS) is a co-educational, independent day school with 840 students enrolled in nursery through ninth grade. The mission of the Greenwich Country Day School is to enable all children in our care to discover and develop what is finest in themselves, to achieve high standards in their studies, in their play, and in their character. We are committed to the ideal of a coeducational family school. We recognize that every child is an individual who possesses unique talents and abilities. In an elementary school program, we promote consideration of others, value diversity, and teach respect for all people and our world. GCDS maintains high academic standards, a broad and balanced curriculum, and time-honored traditions.
