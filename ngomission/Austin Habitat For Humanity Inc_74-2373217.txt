Through faith in action, Austin Habitat for Humanity builds homes in partnership with families and engages our community to end the cycle of poverty housing. Habitat gives families who have no other hope of ever owning their own home the opportunity to achieve their dreams of a place to call home. In 22 years of building homes in partnership with low-income families, Austin Habitat volunteers have created over 200 affordable new houses for people in need.
