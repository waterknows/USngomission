Founded by Congress, the National Forest Foundation (NFF) works with the U.S. Forest Service and communities across the country to care for the 193-million-acre National Forest System and the millions of visitors it receives each year. The NFF brings people together to restore and enhance our National Forests and Grasslands. As the nonprofit partner of the U.S. Forest Service, we engage America in community-based and national programs that promote the health and public enjoyment of the National Forest System. We also administer private gifts of funds and land for the benefit of the National Forests. In helping the U.S. Forest Service fulfill its mission "to maintain the health, diversity and productivity of the nation's forests and grasslands to meet the needs of present and future generations" we work in close collaboration with local people and communities.
