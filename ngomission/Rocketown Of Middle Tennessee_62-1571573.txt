Rocketown's mission is to offer hope to the next generation through Christ's love. Our vision is to be THE place for peace, purpose, and possibilities for youth. Our approach to working with youth is holistic, with programs and services nurturing the mind, body, and spirit of young people. Rocketown serves youth between 8 and 22 years of age of all races, religions, and socioeconomic backgrounds. All young people are welcome at Rocketown, and we regularly interact with those are under-served, unsupported, disconnected, and feel isolated and hopeless. We believe young people grow and learn more readily in a community that is welcoming, diverse, and challenges them to think.Founded by Contemporary Christian Music Artist Michael W. Smith in 1994, Rocketown has served more than 1,000,000 since its inception, through intramural sports activities, after school programs, ministry and outreach programs, live concert events, Tennessee's only indoor skatepark, and our on site coffee bar.
