Founded in 1924, the Presbyterian Home for Children works to restore the identity of children that they will realize their great value and be a blessing to others. Since its founding, the Presbyterian Home for Children has served, loved and prayed for thousands of abandoned, neglected and abused children. The Home provides Christ-centered care and nurturing to children and teens of abuse or neglect, as well as those in need of safety, security and structure.
