The Lexington Humane Society (LHS) advocates the compassionate treatment of animals; educates the community on responsible, lifelong pet ownership; and promotes adoption as the best option when searching for a new pet. LHS cares for over 5,000 homeless animals every year, has an exceptional save rate of 95% for animals in care, and is the largest pet adoption agency in Central Kentucky. Our adoption specialists are trained to help you find the perfect pet and to Adopt Love, while our Finders-Keepers program is designed to help you maintain a healthy, lifelong relationship with your new best friend. We believe education is key to improving the lives of animals, and daily we work to educate the public on the importance of pet spay/neuter and our free and low-cost Spay'sTheWay program, the compassionate treatment of all animals, and responsible, lifelong pet ownership.
