Operation Shoestring is in the business of empowerment. We believe that empowered children become empowered adults; empowered adults create empowered communities; and    empowered communities rise. When we invest in the children and families of our central Jackson service community, all of Jackson rises. In other words, We All Rise Together. Through an elementary to high school continuum of academic, social and emotional support through afterschool programs, summer camps and more, we're empowering our children to reach their own best potential. We also partner with people and organizations from across our city and state to bring needed services and support to our children and their families, including health screenings, financial counseling, social services and more.
