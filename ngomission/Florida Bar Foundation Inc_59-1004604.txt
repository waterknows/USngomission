The Florida Bar Foundation was established in 1956 by Florida lawyers and the Supreme Court of Florida to provide greater access to justice. The Foundation accomplishes its mission primarily through funding of programs that expand and improve representation and advocacy on behalf of low-income persons in civil legal matters; improve the fair and effective administration of justice; and promote service to the public by members of the legal profession by making public service an integral component of the law school experience.
