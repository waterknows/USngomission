Since 1990, Hearts In Motion (H.I.M) has been involved in human services in Central America, recognized by politicians and other organizations as dependable, resourceful and compassionate. The mission of H.I.M is to provide care and medical treatment for children, families, and communities through its programs and sponsorships in the U.S., and Central and South America. H.I.M. also seeks to provide opportunities for individuals to participate in short-term mission experiences. The impact of the trip experience on each team member is at least as great as the impact on the lives of the people we touch.
