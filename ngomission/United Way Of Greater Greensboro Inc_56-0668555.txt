Established during World War I, United Way of Greater Greensboro is working to advance the common good by focusing on our community's most pressing needs in the areas of education, income and health. These are the building blocks for a good life - a quality education that leads to a stable job, enough income to promote self-sufficiency, and good health. Our goal is to create long-lasting and measurable changes that improve the quality of life for individuals, families and children in Greater Greensboro. United Way focuses its attention on the root causes of issues through programs that address specific needs related to Growing Successful Kids, Helping People Help Themselves, and Caring for Everyone's Health.
