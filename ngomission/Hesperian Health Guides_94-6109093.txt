Hesperian Health Guides is a non-profit publisher of books and newsletters for community-based health care. Hesperian publications are written simply and heavily illustrated so that people with little formal education can understand, apply, and share health information. Developed collaboratively with health workers and community members from around the world, our books and newsletters address the underlying social, political, and economic causes of poor health and suggest ways groups can organize to improve health conditions in their communities.
