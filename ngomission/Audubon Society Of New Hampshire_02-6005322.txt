New Hampshire Audubon (NHA), a statewide membership organization, is dedicated to the conservation of wildlife and habitat throughout the state. Independent of the National Audubon Society, NHA has offered programs in wildlife conservation, land protection, environmental policy, and environmental education since 1914. Although NHA is a statewide organization, it also serves members and the public on a local level through its seven staffed visitor centers. While each is a little different from the others, all are a source of educational programs for children and adults, special events, and a means of exploring the outdoors.
