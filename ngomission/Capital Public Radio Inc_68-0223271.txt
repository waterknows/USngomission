Beginning in 1970 as student-operated KERS at California State University, Capital Public Radio's (CPR) mission is to provide a trusted source of information, music and entertainment for curious and thoughtful people, in an efficient, sustainable way, strengthening the civic and cultural life of the communities we serve. CPR's vision is to be a valued, vital and vibrant service that is indispensable to listeners' lives, inspires people to look at the world in different ways and capitalizes on emerging opportunities to serve our listeners/communities. Over 300,000 listeners tune into classical, jazz, news and public affairs programming each week on one of CPR's seven stations serving California's Central Valley and the Sierra Nevada.
