The mission of Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative North America (DNDi NA) is to develop new drugs, or new formulations of existing drugs, for patients suffering from the most neglected communicable diseases. Acting in the public interest, DNDi bridges existing R&D gaps in essential drugs for these diseases by initiating and coordinating drug R&D projects in collaboration with the international research community, the public sector, the pharmaceutical industry, and other relevant partners. DNDi's primary focus has been the development of drugs for the most neglected diseases, such as human African trypanosomiasis (HAT, or sleeping sickness), visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar), and Chagas disease, while considering engagement in R&D projects for other neglected diseases or development of diagnostics and/or vaccines to address unmet needs that others are unable or unwilling to address.
