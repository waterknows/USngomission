Founded in 1969, the California State Parks Foundation (CSPF) is dedicated to protecting, enhancing and advocating for California's magnificent state parks. CSPF is committed to improving the quality of life for all Californians by expanding access to the natural beauty, rich culture and history, and recreational and educational opportunities offered by California's 278 state parks - the largest state park system in the United States. CSPF serves as the independent voice for state parks by facilitating capital improvements, advocating for adequate funding and sound policies for state parks, including deferred maintenance support, and funding educational programs, habitat restoration and land acquisition. Since 1969, CSPF has raised more than $170 million to benefit state parks.
