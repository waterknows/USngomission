Eastside College Preparatory School is an independent 6-12th grade school serving low-income students who will be the first generation in their family to go to college. All students attend tuition-free. The school's approach is geared toward one central mission: the enrollment of every graduate in a four-year college. Since Eastside was founded in 1996, 100% of Eastside's graduates have been admitted to four-year colleges across the country. Eastside has a residential program for students who benefit from the safety, stability and structure it provides. Eastside students come predominantly from East Palo Alto and eastern Menlo Park, as well as from other educationally underserved Bay Area communities.
