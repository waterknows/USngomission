Founded in 1948, the mission of the United Way of Hall County is to unite people, organizations and resources to improve lives in Hall County. Our focus is on EDUCATION, INCOME and HEALTH, because these are the building blocks for a good quality of life. We recruit the people and organizations from all across the community who bring the passion, expertise and resources needed to get things done. We invite you to be a part of the change. You can give, you can advocate and you can volunteer. That's what it means to Live United.
