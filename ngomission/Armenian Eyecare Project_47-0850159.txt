The Armenian EyeCare Project (AECP) is dedicated to providing the Armenian people ophthalmologic care through five primary programs: (1) direct patient care; (2) medical training and education - including on-site training in Armenia and U.S. ophthalmology fellowships; (3) public education and awareness; (4) research; and (5) strengthening the Armenian eye care delivery system through capacity building. The organization is governed by a volunteer board of directors and funded entirely with private dollars. The mission of the AECP is to eliminate preventable blindness and its causes in Armenia and to make eye care accessible to all.
