The House of Bread was founded with the belief that no one deserves to go hungry. We believe that everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. Everyone deserves to have a meal in a place where they feel welcome and appreciated. No one is ever turned away from the House of Bread, and everyone is treated as a special guest. We prevent hunger by offering a hot, nutritious, lunchtime meal 7 days a week. Staff and volunteers work together, primarily using donated food, to prepare the meal each day. We don't believe in duplicating programs or resources offered by other social service agencies in the area. So while our guests enjoy lunch, we offer them referrals and assistance in accessing needed resources. We help our guests with everything from a simple phone call, referral to emergency shelter, to help with finding a preschool for their children.
