United Way of Southeast Mississippi is a local non-profit organization that strives to make a positive impact in Forrest, Lamar and Perry counties. By providing funds to partnering agencies and operating its own programs, United Way addresses community issues in four impact areas: education, financial stability, health, and support services. With the help of many dedicated volunteers, we work to use the community's donations as effectively as possible to meet the needs of our area.
