Founded in 1970, Cornerstone TeleVision (CTV) is a Christian media ministry communicating God's message to the nations. CTV's philosophy is to present a well-balanced and diversified program schedule that proclaims the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ in varied ways by using unique entertaining means to attract all segments of our viewing audience so as to evangelize and edify them - emphasizing CTV produced programming and featuring the best Christian programs available - always aiming to add or replace a program with the same quality or better. Cornerstone TeleVision is here 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, with over 100 programs, ministering salvation, encouragement, and healing through two full-power television stations, over 100 affiliate stations, in-house production of 16 innovative original programs, and a nationwide satellite outreach through Sky Angel.
