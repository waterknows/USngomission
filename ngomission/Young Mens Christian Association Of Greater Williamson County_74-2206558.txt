Founded in 1981, the dream of the YMCA of Greater Williamson County began during the 1970s when the Round Rock United Way formed a committee to study the feasibility of a community-owned and operated youth facility. The Y is dedicated to helping children reach adulthood equipped for the future; providing families with adequate child care and recreational activities they can enjoy together; and helping communities stay together to build a safer, healthier environment. Our future depends on the strength of our children, our families and our communities.
