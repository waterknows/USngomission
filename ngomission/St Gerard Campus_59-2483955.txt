St. Gerard Campus works to provide pregnant teenagers with time and education to meet the physical, psychological, and spiritual challenges of responsible parenthood with self-confidence and self-esteem, and to equip them with the technical skills they need to compete in the marketplace. The campus serves as a maternity home for pregnant and unwed mothers, and is an accredited high school. Day-care and residential programs are available as well. All services are free and offered to everyone. Since 1981 we've helped over 45,500 mothers in crisis.
