Lighthouse of Oakland County (LOC) has been providing services to low-income families in Oakland County since 1972. Last year, LOC provided assistance to families and individuals in need on 70,000 separate occasions. The services these deserving people received were provided by LOC's three key subsidiaries: Lighthouse Community Development (LCD), rejuvenating communities through affordable housing and educated homeowners; Lighthouse Emergency Services (LES), providing emergency food, housing, medical, utility and other services to people who need immediate help; and Lighthouse PATH (PATH), which provides long-term housing and support to help women achieve self-sufficiency and a healthy family environment for their children.
