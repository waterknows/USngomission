The Telfair Museum of Art traces its history from 1886 when the Telfair family home opened to the public as an art museum and school. The Museum now boasts three diverse sites -- the original building, the Telfair Academy of Arts and Sciences, a National Historic Landmark building; the Owens-Thomas House, also a National Historic Landmark; and the Jepson Center for the Arts, a contemporary building which houses 20th- and 21st-century art. Over the years the Telfair has become an invaluable confluence of arts, culture and history that reaches out to its audience through a diverse schedule of exhibitions and programs.
