The Emily Krzyzewski Center (Emily K Center) was established in 2006 and named in honor of Coach Mike Krzyzewski's mother. In founding the Center, Coach Krzyzewski was inspired by his own journey as a first generation college student. Our mission is to inspire students to dream big, act with character and purpose, and reach their potential as leaders in their community. To achieve this mission, we designed and implement three K to College programs, a series of year-round, out-of-school initiatives that serve academically-focused students from low-income backgrounds. We are unique in our capacity to serve students across a fourteen-year timeframe, from first grade through sophomore year of college. In addition to implementing K to College programs, we serve thousands of additional community members each month through facility partnerships. Last year, 70 organizations utilized the Center to expand their programming impact.
