Founded in 1995, Frisco Family Services is a 501(c)(3) non-profit tax-deductible organization who has for 20 years helped members of our communities who are facing hunger, homelessness and other urgent needs improve their quality of life and achieve self-sufficiency in the Frisco and Frisco ISD (which includes Frisco, Little Elm, McKinney and Plano) communities.
