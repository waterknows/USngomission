ICM's mission is "to honor our faiths and strengthen our community one family at a time by helping local families, individuals, and seniors in need." Since its founding in 1985, Interfaith Caring Ministries (ICM) has been a cornerstone in helping to fill in gaps within government social service, health, and education. There are over 25,000 working poor families in ICM's service area. In 2007, ICM served over 4,000 of these families. ICM provides a wide array of services that address an immediate need including: food; financial assistance with rent and/or utility bills; vouchers to the ICM resale shop; financial assistance with prescriptions; referrals for no cost doctor, dentist and optometrist visits; a senior outreach program; school supplies and Christmas gifts to children; childcare scholarship to single parents to assist them in continuing their education.
