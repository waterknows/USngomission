The ministry of Open Air Campaigners (OAC) began in 1892 when a lawyer in Australia began preaching the Gospel in Sydney. Our mission is to take the gospel of Christ out from the church and into the public arena. One of our core values is the key role of the local church in fulfilling the work of God in the world. We seek to enter into partnership with local churches that want help in "jump-starting" their evangelistic ministries. OAC-USA is an evangelistic ministry of preaching the Gospel to lost people and mobilizing the body of Christ primarily through effective open-air outreach. OAC-USA staff minister in Boston, Los Angeles, Baltimore/Washington D.C., Philadelphia, Orlando, and Wyoming.
