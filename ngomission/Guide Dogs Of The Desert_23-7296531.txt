Guide Dogs of the Desert (GDD) was founded in 1972 by Mr. Lafayette "Bud" Maynard with the goal to provide quality guide dogs to the blind and the multi-handicapped blind. GDD improves the lives of the blind by creating opportunities for life-changing independence, and by conducting community and outreach programs. GDD provides safe mobility, loving companionship and the miracle of independence to the blind through the use of a guide dog. We breed, raise and train guide dogs, then train the blind to work with them and offer post graduate support the entire time the team is working together. We do all of this at no cost to our blind clients.
