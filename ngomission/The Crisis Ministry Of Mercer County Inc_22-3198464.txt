The Crisis Ministry of Mercer County provides practical, caring programs that address hunger prevention, homelessness prevention and workforce training. Through our three "Client Choice" grocery-style pantries in Trenton (123 E. Hanover St.; 714-16 S. Clinton Ave.) and Princeton (61 Nassau St.) customers make their own selections based on household size and up-to-date nutritional guidelines. The Crisis Ministry helps to stabilize critical housing situations through emergency financial assistance and housing stability case management. Harvesting Hope is our on-site work training and mentoring program that educates and prepares 75 men and women per year for entry or re-entry into the workforce. We also educate the wider Princeton-Trenton community about issues that affect low-income people.
