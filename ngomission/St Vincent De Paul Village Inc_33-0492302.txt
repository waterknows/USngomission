Founded in 1992, The mission of St. Vincent de Paul Village is to prevent and end homelessness one life at a time. On any given night, almost 850 adults and children who are homeless sleep safely at the Village and then engage in community programs designed to end their homelessness as quickly as possible. The services provided by the agency are housing, supportive services, permanent supportive housing, and community lunch line.
