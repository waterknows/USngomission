The Tri County Humane Society is a no-kill organization dedicated to saving animals. We try to stop the killing over 45,000 unwanted pets in Broward County, 65,000 in Miami-Dade County, and 60,000 in Palm Beach County each year. We hope to place as many as possible in our no-kill shelter and find them wonderful loving homes. Tri County rescues thousands of pups, cats, dogs and kittens each year that were on death row ready to be euthanized.
