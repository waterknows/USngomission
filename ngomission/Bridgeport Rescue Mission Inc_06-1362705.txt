Established in 1993, the Bridgeport Rescue Mission works to fight poverty from the inside out as we embrace the urban poor and addicted with the compassion of Christ, offering hope and healing for a changed life. It is our vision to excel in the provision of food, shelter, clothing, education, job training and residential discipleship for the urban poor and addicted. Bridgeport Rescue Mission demonstrates the love of God to hungry, homeless and addicted people throughout Fairfield County, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. We provide a place of hope and dignity through a yearlong educational program, biblical counseling and case management.
