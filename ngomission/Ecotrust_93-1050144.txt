Created in 1991, Ecotrust's goal is to foster a natural model of development that creates more resilient communities, economies, and ecosystems at home and around the world. We work with scientists, economists, bankers, builders, foresters, farmers, fisherman, tribal leaders, policy makers, and other key stakeholders in our Pacific Northwest region to promote systemic change toward an economy inspired by and supportive of the resilience found in nature. We do this by innovating, investing in, and inspiring place-based solutions that offer transformative opportunities that are replicable world-wide. Ecotrust's many innovations include co-founding the world's first environmental bank, starting the world's first ecosystem investment fund, creating a range of programs in fisheries, forestry, food, farms and indigenous affairs, and developing new scientific and information tools to improve social, economic and environmental decision-making.
