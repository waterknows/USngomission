HelpHOPELive (formerly NTAF) has nearly 30 years' success empowering individuals and families to overcome financial barriers related to transplantation or catastrophic injury through grass-roots fundraising. When families call us, they are devastated. HelpHOPELive provides the consultation needed to bridge the gap between what health insurance will pay and what is actually needed to heal, live and thrive. As examples, in 2011 we provided $3.5 million to transplant patients for life-sustaining medication, travel to treatment, relocation and other daunting expenses. We also provided $3.1 million to help those living with catastrophic injury on the road to independence with items including vans, home accessibility and exercise-based rehab. Since inception through FYE 09/2011, HelpHOPELive has a) helped families raise nearly $80 million through community-based fundraising b) provided resources to 23,000 families and c) paid more than $66 million for uninsured medical expenses.
