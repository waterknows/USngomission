The Partnership for After School Education (PASE) is a child-focused organization that promotes and supports quality afterschool programs, particularly those serving young people from underserved communities. PASE is here to ensure that the afterschool part of that equation is of high quality and is available to all youth. PASE accomplishes its mission by building the capacity of individual afterschool staff, youth-serving organizations, and the field as a whole, all with the goal of increasing the availability of quality services to youth in out of school time.
