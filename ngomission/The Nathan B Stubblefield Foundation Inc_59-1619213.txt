WMNF first went on the air in September, 1979. We are an independent grassroots media organization that entertains, educates and unites the community around our shared values. WMNF is volunteer-powered and listener-sponsored, providing the listening community with eclectic music as well as non-mainstream news, views and public affairs programming. WMNF is licensed to the Nathan B. Stubblefield Foundation, a non-profit organization established solely to operate WMNF. WMNF advocates for peace, social and environmental justice through independent media and programming neglected by the mainstream. We embrace diversity, tolerance of others' opinions and freedom of expression. WMNF celebrates and promotes the creative, cultural and political vitality of the local community.
