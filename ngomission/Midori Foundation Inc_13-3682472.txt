Founded in 1992 by the world-renowned violinist, Midori, and a committed board of directors, Midori & Friends has enhanced the lives of almost 200,000 under-served New York City children and their families through providing high-quality music education programs and initiatives. We serve over 15,000 students annually in 40 public schools and community agency sites within New York City's most disadvantaged communities. Focusing on children with little or no access to the arts, our programs are offered at no cost to students and available to all children regardless of their musical ability, education, or economic background. In many cases, our music programs provide the first experiences in which children become engaged in school, realize a sense of accomplishment, and attain self-confidence.
