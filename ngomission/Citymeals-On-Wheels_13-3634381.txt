Citymeals-on-Wheels provides a continuous lifeline of nutritious food and human company to homebound elderly New Yorkers in need, thereby helping them to live with dignity in their own familiar homes and communities. Citymeals funds 30 community-based agencies that bring weekend, holiday, emergency and weekday meals to homebound elderly New Yorkers who can no longer shop or cook for themselves. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, Citymeals-on-Wheels delivered 2.2 million meals to 18,000 New Yorkers at times when they would otherwise have been alone and hungry. City meal's long range goal is to ensure that every homebound elderly New Yorker in need has access to 100% of the daily nutrients required for optimum health.
