Since 1983, the Children's Museum of Pittsburgh has been fulfilling its mission - to nurture children's innate joy, creativity, and curiosity - while focusing on gross motor development, language arts skills, health education, self-esteem, and personal responsibility. Each year, thousands of children, parents, grandparents, and teachers have explored hands-on exhibits, enjoyed original artwork by native Pittsburghers, and taken part in performances, storytelling, and artistic demonstrations. All of which have challenged their minds and ignited their imaginations. It has also served as an invaluable educational resource for families, schools, and community groups.
