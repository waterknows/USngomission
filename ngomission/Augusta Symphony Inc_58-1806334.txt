Founded in 1954, the mission of Symphony Orchestra Augusta (SOA) is to share the joy of great musical performance with our audience. Since then, SOA has expanded from a small community symphony orchestra into a regional symphony orchestra, offering services in two states and 17 counties throughout Georgia and South Carolina. SOA shares its love through a variety of concert series, including its Symphony Series, Pops! at the Bell, and Pops! Under the Stars.
