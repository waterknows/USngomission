Since 1991, Read Ahead (formerly known as Everybody Wins! New York) has been devoted to promoting children's literacy in the New York metropolitan area, through our signature reading mentors program. Read Ahead intervenes at a pivotal point in children's schooling to improve their odds for a better and more literate life. By taking part in our reading-based mentoring program, students who struggle with reading are able to increase their proficiency and improve their self-confidence, motivating them to read more for pleasure in school and at home. The reading mentors program does more than develop necessary reading skills. It enables children to create lives for themselves that are fulfilling, and often, inspiring.
