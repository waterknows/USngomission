Founded in 2000, The Global Health and Education Foundation (GHEF) was created in order to address problems of disability, lack of safe water and basic sanitation, and the absence of inadequate disease prevention comprehensively and systematically, utilizing the most powerful and proven tools available. GHEF aims to be a world-class leading organization dedicated to improving the health and well-being of individuals globally by providing comprehensive, needs-based solutions enabled by innovative and proven business models and technologies. The Global Health and Education Foundation was built upon the tremendous success of the Wheelchair Foundation, a non-profit organization founded by Kenneth E. Behring in 2000, now a sub-division of GHEF.
