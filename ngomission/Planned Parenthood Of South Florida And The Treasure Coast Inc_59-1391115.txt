Planned Parenthood of South Florida and the Treasure Coast, Inc. is a private healthcare agency founded and incorporated in 1971 by Harriette Glasner and Dr. Carl Brumback. Our affiliate was established due to concerns about the rising rates of teenage pregnancy, increasing incidence of sexually transmitted diseases, and lack of birth control information and services. Our goals were and remain to provide reproductive healthcare to all people requesting such services and to educate the community in all areas of responsible human sexuality.

As our mission is to ensure broad public access to quality reproductive healthcare through direct service, education, and advocacy, our efforts focus on: medical services, educational programs, and public affairs.
