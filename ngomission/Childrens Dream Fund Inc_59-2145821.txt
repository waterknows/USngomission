The Children's Dream Fund was founded in 1981 with the single purpose of fulfilling dreams for children ages 3-18 who have been diagnosed with a life-threatening illness. Referrals are received from several hospitals on Florida's west coast. Dreams vary greatly - from trips to Disney World, meetings with celebrities, computers, play sets, cruises and shopping sprees. Every child deserves hope and a dream. Our desire is to grant every eligible child's dream. The Children's Dream Fund operates out of an office in downtown St. Petersburg, Florida and serves children living in 20 counties in West Central Florida.
