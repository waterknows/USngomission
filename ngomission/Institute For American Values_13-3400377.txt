The Institute for American Values, founded in 1987, is a private, nonpartisan organization that contributes intellectually to strengthening families and civil society in the U.S. and the world. The Institute seeks to bring fresh knowledge to bear on the challenges facing the American family and civil society. Through its Malta Forum, its Council on Family Law, and its academic and professional advisory committees, which bring together many of the nation's most distinguished scholars and analysts from across the human sciences and from across the political spectrum, the Institute seeks to bridge the gap between scholarship and policymaking, bringing new information and analyses to the attention of policy makers in government, opinion makers in the media, and decision makers in the private sector and in civil society.
