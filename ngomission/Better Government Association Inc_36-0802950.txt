The Better Government Association (BGA) works for integrity, transparency, and accountability in government by exposing corruption and inefficiency; identifying and advocating effective public policy; and engaging and mobilizing the electorate to achieve authentic and responsible reform. Our Investigative Unit looks into allegations of waste, fraud and corruption in city, county, suburban and state government, and the results are made public through partnerships with local media. The Policy Advocacy Unit builds on the results of the BGA investigations to propose policy solutions to corruption, inefficiency, lack of accountability and waste in government.
