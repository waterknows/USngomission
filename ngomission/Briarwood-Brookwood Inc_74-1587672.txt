The Brookwood Community is a God-centered educational, residential, and entrepreneurial community for adults with functional disabilities located in Brookshire, Texas, just west of Houston. Mission-spirited teachers work with the Brookwood citizens to provide a careful balance between independence and assistance. Brookwood demonstrates that with God's help, all people have a contribution to make to society if given the opportunity. The Briarwood School is an independent, co-educational day school for children with learning differences. Especially designed for children in grades K-12, the individualized educational process at Briarwood is total. We educate the mind, cultivate the spirit, and strive to enhance self-esteem through academic, physical, emotional, and social growth.
