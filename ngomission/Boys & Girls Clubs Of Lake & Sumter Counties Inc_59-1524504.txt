At the Boys & Girls Clubs of Lake and Sumter Counties, our mission is to inspire and enable all young people, especially those who need us most, to realize their full potential as productive, responsible, and caring citizens. Our vision is to provide a world-class Club Experience that assures success is within reach of every child who walks through our doors, with all members on track to graduate from high school with a plan for the future, demonstrating good character and citizenship, and living a healthy lifestyle.
