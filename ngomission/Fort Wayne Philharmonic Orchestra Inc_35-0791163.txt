The Fort Wayne Philharmonic works to inspire and foster a lifelong love of classical music through performance and education. Founded in 1944, we present musical and education programs of the highest quality in order to sustain and expand our musical tradition to a growing audience throughout the tri-state region. We aim to create, perform, and export innovative artistic programs. Our education programs bring classical music into the ever-changing community and provide expanding opportunities for individuals to experience, enjoy, and be challenged by the musical arts.
