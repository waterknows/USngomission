PowerMyLearning is a national non-profit organization committed to ensuring that all children are able to power their learning through a combination of technology and the people who matter most to their success - parents and teachers. For decades technology has not delivered on its promise of transforming education. Why? Because technology is often being used to replace the people who matter most to a student's learning - their teachers or their parents/guardians. At PowerMyLearning, we take a different approach. We focus on using technology not to replace anyone, but rather to enhance the key interactions among teachers, parents, and students. When the key interactions are properly supported, they propel the two cycles that are most critical for student learning: the Personalized Instruction cycle and the Student-Driven Learning cycle.Our work has demonstrated impact on student achievement and love of learning; teacher instructional practices; and parental confidence.
