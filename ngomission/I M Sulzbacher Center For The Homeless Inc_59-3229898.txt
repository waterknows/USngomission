Since 1995, Sulzbacher Center has grown to become a center of services for the homeless in downtown Jacksonville. Sulzbacher Center is Northeast Florida's only provider of comprehensive services for homeless men, women and children. We are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. We serve nutritious meals and offer safe shelter. But that is just the beginning. We provide outstanding health care and high-quality children's programs. Our job placement assistance and life skills programs equip men and women for employment and for success. We offer something simple, but important - hope.
