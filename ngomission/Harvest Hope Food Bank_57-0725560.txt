Beginning in 1981 as an emergency food box program, Harvest Hope Food Bank is now a regional distribution program that collects, stores and distributes food and related items to more than 450 qualified agencies engaged in feeding needy, elderly and ill families and children throughout central South Carolina. The mission of Harvest Hope Food Bank is to provide for the needs of hungry people by gathering and sharing quality food with dignity, compassion and education. As a member of Feeding America, the national network of over 200 food banks, Harvest Hope is a powerful agent in the war against hunger. On average, we distribute over 19 million pounds of food per year.
