Founded in 1908, the YWCA of San Diego County provides women and families with the shelter and services they need to escape homelessness and domestic violence. Our menu of programs and services - including residential programs, counseling, legal support and career assistance - are designed to accommodate the physical, emotional, intellectual and social services needs of homeless women and families as well as those facing domestic violence issues. The mission of the YWCA is to increase safety, promote healing, foster empowerment, and give hope to women and families through innovative programs, services and advocacy. Our priorities are to increase safety, promote healing, provide empowerment, and give hope.
