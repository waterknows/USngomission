Southwest Christian Care works to glorify God as guardians of the sanctity and dignity of life by providing physical, emotional, and spiritual care to our patients and their families and offer hope based on faith in Jesus Christ as Lord of life and death. We serve people from all walks of life, without regard to economic status, race or religion. We provide place where our patients and their family members can find inner peace and be strengthened and supported. Whether we are serving a terminally ill patient in hospice, providing respite for a child with special needs or giving special love and attention to seniors, our goal is to offer the very best care possible in a nurturing and accepting environment.
