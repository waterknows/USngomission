KICKSTART KIDS is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization with a mission to build strong moral character in our youth through martial arts. We provide a program that replaces many missing elements in our students' lives by offering a mentoring role model, a greater chance to succeed in reaching their goals, and developing discipline through physical & mental conditioning. Most importantly, KICKSTART KIDS gives our students hope for their futures and an opportunity to believe in themselves.
