The American Swedish Institute (ASI), founded in 1929 by Swedish immigrant newspaperman Swan J. Turnblad, is a historic house, museum, and cultural center that celebrates Swedish and Swedish-American culture. The Institute's Turnblad mansion is on the National Register of Historic Places. The ASI's purpose is to maintain an institute for the purpose of education to provide lectures, public meetings, conferences, art galleries, libraries, museums, exhibitions, concerts, and publications which promote knowledge of Swedish arts, literature and science. Our accomplishments for fiscal year ending 2008 include 75,000 museum visitors, two major exhibits, 10 smaller exhibits, and enhancements to permanent exhibits.
