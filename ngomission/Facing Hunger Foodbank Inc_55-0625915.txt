Facing Hunger Foodbank is a private, non-profit, charitable organization founded in 1983 and is incorporated in West Virginia. Formerly known as the Huntington Area Food Bank, the foodbank initially served Cabell and Wayne Counties. The need was so great across the region that the foodbank expanded its service area after just its first year of operation. The foodbank's service area currently includes nearly 200 agencies across 17 counties in West Virginia, eastern Kentucky and southeastern Ohio.
