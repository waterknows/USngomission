United Way of Midland County is working to advance the common good. We focus our efforts in three impact areas: Education, Self-Sufficiency and Health. These are the building blocks of a good life: Equipping people with the tools to reach their full potential, empowering them to live independently, and promoting health and healing. The goal of United Way is create long-lasting change and prevent problems from happening in the first place. We seek to create opportunities for a better life for all, because when you reach out a hand to one, you can influence the condition of all.
