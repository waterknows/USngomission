Opened in 1990, The Tech Museum of Innovation is an educational resource established to engage people of all ages and backgrounds in exploring and experiencing technologies affecting their lives, and to inspire the young to become innovators in the technologies of the future. An expansive variety of interactive exhibits and unique floor programs showcase not just how technology works, but how it affects who we are and how we live, work, play and learn. The Tech's 132,000 square feet are divided among themed galleries focused on innovation, the internet, the human body, and exploration. Annually, The Tech plays host to roughly 400,000 guests - 80,000 of whom visit as part of a school field trip - making it one of California's most popular destinations.
