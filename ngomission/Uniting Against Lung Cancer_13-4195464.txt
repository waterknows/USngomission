Uniting Against Lung Cancer (Uniting) funds innovative research to find a cure for lung cancer and increase awareness of the disease, including in people who have never smoked. The organization was founded in 2001 as Joan's Legacy, in honor of Joan Scarangello McNeive. To better reflect the foundation's commitment to uniting all families and organizations dedicated to conquering lung cancer, in 2009, the name was changed to Uniting Against Lung Cancer. Today Uniting Against Lung Cancer: awards individual grants to researchers at leading cancer centers; empowers its nationally respected medical committee to identify the most promising ideas and research projects; promotes and recognizes excellence in journalism about lung cancer; and collaborates with others in seeking a cure for lung cancer in all its forms.
