Founded in 1946, the Boys & Girls Clubs of Metropolitan Phoenix (BGCMP) provides services to more than 34,000 boys and girls annually, operating a total of 12 clubhouses throughout the central and west area Valley, a full-service dental clinic and outreach services. BGCMP enables all young people, especially those who need us most, to reach their full potential as productive, caring, responsible citizens. Our focus is to provide quality after-school programs, under the supervision of a professional staff, that supplement and enhance their learning and nurturing environments.
