College Track is the catalyst for change for under-resourced high school students who are motivated to earn a college degree. Since its inception, College Track has grown each year, strengthening its services and expanding its program to support more and more students. College Track is an after-school, college preparatory program. Through our center-based approach and core service areas, College Track has created a culture of high expectations. We ensure that each student is college ready and provide support that many students do not have in their homes or at their schools. Together, these components make a powerful, comprehensive program that empowers students to achieve their dream of a college education.
