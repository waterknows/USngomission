The Episcopal Church Foundation (ECF), founded in 1949, has been responding to the changing needs of the Episcopal Church for 60 years. The mission of the Episcopal Church Foundation is to strengthen the leadership and financial capabilities of Episcopal congregations, dioceses, and related organizations to pursue their mission and ministry. The vision for the Episcopal Church Foundation is to be a comprehensive and holistic resource that helps revitalize Episcopal communities of faith. In addition to our wide array of leadership and financial resource development programs, products, and services, ECF has been involved with the following initiatives since its founding: establishing a revolving (Church building) loan fund, forming the Alban Institute, supported the creation of the Church Deployment Office, and started the Doctoral Fellows Program among many others.
