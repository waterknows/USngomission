Founded by a handful of concerned citizens in 1901, the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests (Forest Society) is now one of the country's most effective statewide land conservation organizations. As a membership organization with over 10,000 members, the Forest Society is dedicated to protecting the state's most important landscapes while promoting the wise use of its renewable natural resources. The Forest Society envisions a living landscape where managed woodlands, farms and wild lands are woven into the fabric of community life. We envision people caring for lands that sustain dynamic communities with clean water and air, forest and agricultural products, habitat for native plants and animals, scenic beauty, good jobs, and recreational opportunities.
