Established in 1942 by the Secretary of War, Army Emergency Relief (AER) is proud to have helped more than three million soldiers and their families overcome financial emergencies during these last 67 years. Since its founding, AER has always been where soldiers are stationed when they needed help. While active duty soldiers receive the bulk of our assistance, we continually help retired soldiers and widows/widowers also. We also have a robust education scholarship program that provides financial support for both dependent children and spouses.
