The Central Oklahoma Humane Society exists to enrich the communities it serves by promoting the well-being of animals. The Central Oklahoma Humane Society was founded in 2007. We work in close partnership with the Oklahoma City Animal Welfare Division (OKC Animal Shelter) and our primary focus is to eliminate the needless euthanasia of healthy, adoptable animals in Oklahoma City. Since our beginning in 2007, we have found homes for over 11,000 cats and dogs and spayed and neutered about 50,000 pets.
