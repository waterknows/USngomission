Common Hope promotes hope and opportunity in Guatemala, partnering with children, families, and communities who want to participate in a process of development to improve their lives through education, health care, and housing. The organization was established in 1986 by the Huebsch family, who made the difficult decision to leave friends, family, and a peaceful lifestyle to see what they could offer the people of Guatemala. Since then, Common Hope has grown into a dynamic organization serving more than 11,000 Guatemalan children and adults living in rural and urban poverty. With Common Hope, more than 1,500 young adults have graduated from high school with the skills for professional careers, in a country where the average adult drops out before sixth grade and survives on several dollars a day.
