Lone Star Flight Museum (LSFM) began as a private aircraft collection in June 1985. The mission of the LSFM is to promote and encourage the study of the science of aviation; acquire, restore to flying condition, maintain, operate, and display historically significant vintage aircraft; honor and recognize Texas aviation events; increase public understanding, appreciation and awareness of the role of Texans in the advancement of aviation; and preserve, protect and present Texas' aviation heritage for future generations. Today LSFM displays over 40 historically significant aircraft and over 1500 artifacts that demonstrate the quantum leap in technology - from gliders to space - over the past century. LSFM's flying collection of award winning aircraft annually logs more than 40,000 cross-country air miles to participate in flying displays and air shows.
