Can Do Multiple Sclerosis, formerly The Heuga Center for Multiple Sclerosis, is an innovative provider of lifestyle empowerment programs for people with MS and their support partners. A national nonprofit organization, we empower people to move beyond their MS by giving them the knowledge, skills, tools and confidence to adopt healthy lifestyle behaviors, actively co-manage their disease and live their best lives. The organization has helped thousands of people living with MS transform challenges into possibilities in health and life. In 2009, we provided programs and services to more than 6,000 people. Can Do MS honors the legacy and beliefs of the organization's founder, Jimmie Heuga, who founded the organization in 1984.
