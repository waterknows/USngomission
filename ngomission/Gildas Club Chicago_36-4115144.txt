Gilda's Club Chicago is a free cancer support community for anyone - men, women, teens and children, as well as their family and friends - whose lives have been impacted by any kind of cancer. Our innovative program, including more than 350 free activities each month, is an essential complement to medical care and includes healthy lifestyle workshops, educational lectures, social opportunities, support and networking groups, and resource referrals. We also have volunteer opportunities at the Clubhouse on Wells Street, as well as in the community. Gilda's Club Chicago is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization and is funded through donations from individuals, businesses, foundations and special events. Our mission is to ensure that all people impacted by cancer are empowered by knowledge, strengthened by action and sustained by community. We do that by providing free cancer support for the whole family, the whole time - including caregivers.
