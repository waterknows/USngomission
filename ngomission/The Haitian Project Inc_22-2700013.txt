The Haitian Project, founded in the early 1980's, is a Catholic Mission which supports and operates Louverture Cleary School (LCS), a tuition-free, Catholic, co-educational secondary boarding school in Haiti. The Haitian Project through Louverture Cleary School, educates and nurtures academically talented and motivated students from Haitian families who cannot afford the cost of their children's education in order to maximize their potential and enable them to work toward building a Haiti where justice and peace thrive.
