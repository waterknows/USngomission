From its genesis in 1935, Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin (PPWI) has been a leader in providing reproductive health care, birth control, education, and the advocacy to help make all of this possible. While PPWI has delivered these services under different names and at various locations, our mission has remained essentially consistent. In fact, we have recommitted to reestablishing our important connections with our original supports, including religious communities and other private and government health care providers, as well as revitalizing our educational outreach programs statewide. Today's Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin is physically present in 28 health centers across Wisconsin.
