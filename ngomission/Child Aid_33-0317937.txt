Child Aid's mission is to create opportunity for Latin America's rural and indigenous poor through childhood literacy and education programs. We conduct reading programs in partnership with over 52 communities in Guatemala and put books into the hands of thousands of children. We provide critical training to teachers and librarians and offer scholarships to impoverished students. Child Aid's literacy work provides the means for children to break out of poverty and build better lives for themselves and their families.
