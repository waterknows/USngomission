The Wetlands Initiative is dedicated to restoring the wetland resources of the Midwest to improve water quality, increase wildlife habitat and biodiversity, and reduce flood damages. TWI was founded in 1994 to reverse the environmental damage created by the drainage of valuable wetlands in the upper Midwest. Today TWI works as "conservation entrepreneurs" to develop new methods and strategies for restoring our lost wetland ecosystems.TWI projects focus on the Illinois River Basin. The organization seeks to conduct and support high-quality restoration projects through direct, on-the-ground work and by forming larger partnerships to demonstrate innovative ways to finance large-scale wetland restoration, such as ecosystem service markets. With a focus on science-based, economically sustainable projects and collaborative work with public agencies, TWI's goal is to develop restoration methods and models that others may copy.
