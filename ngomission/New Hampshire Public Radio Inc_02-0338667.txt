The mission of New Hampshire Public Radio (NHPR) is to help create a more informed public, one challenged and enriched by a deeper understanding and appreciation of state, national and worldwide events, ideas and culture. To that end, we offer the highest quality news and information and cultural programming that we can achieve within the limits of our resources. We do this through our broadcasts and through our web operations. We have grown significantly since we began broadcasting in 1981, from 500 station members to nearly 15,000 and from a single station to six transmitters and four translators. With a signal that can be heard in almost every corner of the state, NHPR is committed to bring the different regions of this state together.
