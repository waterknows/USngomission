Founded in 1970, Precept Ministries International is dedicated to equipping people everywhere with the tools to discover Truth for themselves by studying God's Word inductively. We are convinced that studying the Bible inductively is the most powerful and rewarding method to personal discovery and longer retention. Believers all over the world tell us these tools have made the most significant difference in their walk with God. There are three steps to inductive Bible study: observation, interpretation, and application.
