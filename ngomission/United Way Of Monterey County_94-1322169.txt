United Way Monterey County was incorporated on June 30, 2000 as a result of a merger between United Way of the Monterey Peninsula (founded 1929) and United Way of the Salinas Valley (founded 1944). Our mission is to engage the community and focus resources to improve lives in Monterey County. We are a locally governed organization that identifies and addresses the most critical issues and needs of the people within our community. Annually, one in four people in Monterey County will directly benefit from the services of a United Way Agency.
