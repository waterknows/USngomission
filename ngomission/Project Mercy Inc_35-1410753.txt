Founded in 1977, Project Mercy is an international emergency relief and community development ministry that promotes education, health care, and other holistic community development projects to create economically independent communities with high ethical and social values. After years of responding to humanitarian crises throughout Africa, Project Mercy seeks to end the cycle of famine and disease through holistic community development initiatives. Our model community is located in Yetebon, Ethiopia. With the support of the local community and our partners, we have created a foundation for self-sufficiency. Our programs include the Medhane-Alem School, the Glenn C. Olsen Hospital, men's and women's skills enhancement, dairy cattle breeding, an agriculture program, and HIV/AIDS orphan care.
