At Jewish Big Brothers Big Sisters of Los Angeles, our mission is to assist children, primarily from single-parent homes, in achieving their full potential by helping to facilitate Excellence in Mentoring. Our goal is to continue enriching the lives of children by providing mentoring programs that help develop self-esteem, self-respect, and relationship building skills.
