The purpose of Central Illinois Foodbank is to collect donated food and grocery items from growers, manufacturers, processors, and wholesalers for distribution to charitable agencies serving people in need. Central Illinois Foodbank is a warehouse located in Springfield, IL. Our food distribution program serves 150 agencies throughout 21 central Illinois counties. In addition to our partnership with our agencies, we are proud to host the Kids Cafe program. Kids Cafe is a nation-wide program through Feeding America, formerly America's Second Harvest, that feeds children a hot, nutritious meal in a safe environment.
