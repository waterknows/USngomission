FLAME (Facts and Logic About the Middle East) has for over fifteen years brought the truth about Israel and the Middle East conflict to the attention of an American public that is mostly uninformed and misinformed about these matters. FLAME's main purpose is to research and publish facts regarding developments in the Middle East and expose false propaganda that might harm the interests of the United States and its allies in that area of the world. FLAME is the only organization that, in a systematic manner, acquaints the American public with the truth about Israel, the enormous pressures to which the Jewish State is subject, and the great dangers--existential dangers--it would face if it were to yield to these pressures.
