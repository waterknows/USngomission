Organized in 1921, the Girl Scout Council of Greater Atlanta builds girls of courage, confidence and character, who make the world a better place. The Council serves approximately 41,000 girls and over 17,700 adult members in 34 counties in the Greater Metropolitan Atlanta area, northwest Georgia and Polk County, TN. The Girl Scout Leadership Model provides the design for what girls do in Girl Scouting. It illustrates how adult support strengthens girls' experiences and drives and displays all the elements that must be in place to create a positive impact on girls' lives.
