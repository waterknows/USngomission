The Agriculture Future of America (AFA) works to create partnerships that identify, encourage and support outstanding college men and women preparing for careers in the agriculture and food industry. Founded in 1996 by R. Crosby Kemper, Jr., and other agri-business leaders, AFA offers leader and career development training and community-based academic scholarships for college men and women pursuing a career in an agriculture-related field. AFA men and women share the belief that the production, processing and distribution of food and fiber, with support for agriculture business services, are vital for our nation's economy, both now and in the future.
