Turnstone Center for Children and Adults with Disabilities was founded in 1943 as the Allen County Society for Crippled Children. The agency began as an educational program with volunteers teaching six children with special needs. Through the years, the agency and its program offerings grew, and a new facility was found to house both the budding children's program; as well as a new program for adults with disabilities. It is our mission to enhance the lives of all persons with physical disabilities and their families. Turnstone is committed to inclusion and diversity in its activities, programs, hiring practices, and volunteer utilization.
