Coastal Conservation Association (CCA) is comprised of 17 coastal state chapters spanning the Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic and Pacific coasts. CCA's strength is drawn from the tens of thousands of recreational saltwater anglers who make up its membership. From South Texas to the upper reaches of Maine, CCA's grassroots influence is felt through state capitals, U.S. Congress and, most importantly, in the conservation and restoration of our coastal marine resources. CCA's unmatched breadth and depth of volunteer involvement has made it the largest marine conservation group of its kind. Its grassroots network and unique combination of membership, fundraising and advocacy have enacted positive change on all levels of coastal marine conservation and management.
