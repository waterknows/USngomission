Venture, formerly known as Washington Community Alliance for Self-Help (C.A.S.H.) provides the business training, supportive community, and capital to help enterprising individuals with limited financial resources gain self-sufficiency through small business ownership.Venture was created in 1995 after our founder Peter Rose visited a Grameen Bank program in Bangladesh-a microfinance model that made small loans to groups of disadvantaged women. Since then we've adapted the Grameen model to the Puget Sound region and the business landscape in the United States, leading with business training and supporting with financial tools and resources tailored to client needs. We continue to adapt our approach over time to incorporate best practices and meet changing client needs. Our ultimate goal is to advance individual financial self-sufficiency and community economic development through small business growth.
