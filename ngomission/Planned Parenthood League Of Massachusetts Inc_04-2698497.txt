The mission of Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts is to protect and promote sexual and reproductive health and freedom of choice by providing clinical services, education and advocacy. Our vision is that sexual health is essential to every person's well-being. At Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts, we envision a future where sexual health is a personal and public health priority. We are working to normalize sexual health through our education programs and a public awareness campaign designed to get people talking about what sexual health is, what it means to be sexually healthy, and the changes we need to improve sexual health in our culture.
