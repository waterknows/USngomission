Home of the Innocents, a community of dedicated people and those they serve, provides the skills and opportunities by which vulnerable children, youth and their families may improve their lives. Home of the Innocents is a private, non-profit agency that has been in operation for over 130 years and served almost 4,000 children last year in Kentucky and Southern Indiana. The Home provides services to assist those who are facing severe crisis, including: residential and community-based services to children who have been abused, abandoned, or neglected; a hospital-like and home away from home environment for medically fragile children; and in-home and in-school support services for children with autism. The Home now operates Open Arms Children's Health - a one-stop full service pediatric medical practice offering integrated care, including medical, dental, hearing, vision, radiology, pharmacy, and behavioral health services.
