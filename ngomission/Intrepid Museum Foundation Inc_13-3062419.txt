The mission of the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum is to honor our heroes, educate the public and inspire our youth. As an educational and cultural not-for-profit institution, the Museum is dedicated to promoting the awareness and understanding of history, science and service through its collections, exhibitions and programming. Founded in 1982 and located on the Hudson River in New York City, the Museum is one of the world's most successful historic ship museums, drawing more than one million visitors annually. The Museum's exhibitions feature a former aircraft carrier USS Intrepid designated a National Historic Landmark in 1986, the NASA space shuttle Enterprise (included in 2013 in the National Register of Historic Places), a collection of 27 World War II and Cold War era aircraft, the Cold War era submarine Growler, a British Airways Concorde and a Soyuz TMA-6 spacecraft that traveled from the International Space Station in 2005.
