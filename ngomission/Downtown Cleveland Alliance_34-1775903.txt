Downtown Cleveland Alliance is dedicated to building a dynamic downtown. It is committed to making downtown Cleveland the most compelling place to live, work, play and visit in the region. Downtown Cleveland Alliance, working hand in hand with downtown property owners, creates forums for communication and involvement by a diverse group of downtown stakeholders, including local development corporations, city and county governments, civic and arts organizations, residents, young professionals and business stakeholders. By facilitating the collaboration of these groups, DCA strives to enhance the quality of life in the urban core by implementing initiatives like the Clean & Safe Program, economic development assistance, marketing & special events, advocacy and strategic projects.
