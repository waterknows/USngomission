ArtsWave helps create the kind of thriving arts environment that makes the Cincinnati region a better place to live, work, play, and stay. We support and collaborate with arts organizations large and small throughout the area. Music, dance, theatre, galleries, museums, art centers, festivals, and more create communitywide benefits for everyone here. The arts create benefits like attractive, lively neighborhoods and a population that comes together to share ideas and experiences.
