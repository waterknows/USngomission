The United States Olympic Committee (USOC) was incorporated by Congress for the purpose of establishing national goals for amateur athletic activities, and to aid and encourage the attainment of those goals. The USOC is charged with the task of coordinating and developing amateur athletic activity in the United States, which directly relates to international amateur athletic competition. In addition, the committee exercises exclusive jurisdiction over all matters pertaining to the participation of the United States in the Olympic, Paralympic and Pan-American Games. The Committee also represents the U.S. as its national Olympic Committee in relations with the International Olympic Committee and the Pan-American Sports Organization, and as a national Paralympic Committee with the International Paralympic Committee.
