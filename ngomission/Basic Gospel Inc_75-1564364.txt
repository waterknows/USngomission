Basic Gospel (formerly People to People Ministries) has helped thousands of people find strength and security on a foundation that can never be shaken, shattered, or cracked. This foundation is the remarkable truth of God's unconditional love and His indisputable grace experienced in a relationship with Jesus Christ. Through its various outreaches, Basic Gospel communicates how the Gospel message is not a doctrine to be learned, but a vital truth to be experienced. Since 1985, our radio broadcast with Bob George and Bob Davis has brought a message of grace, hope, and love in Jesus Christ to listeners across America and Canada via satellite. Basic Gospel now reaches the world via the Internet.
