Thirty years ago, La Casa de las Madres opened San Francisco's first domestic violence shelter for women and their children. The once-quiet shelter has grown into the city's leading voice for abused women, their children and teens - educating, promoting awareness and changing the community's and the media's perceptions about domestic violence and its victims. Through a broad service continuum, we also provide expert intervention and prevention services to more than 10,000 community members annually. Our service continuum offers emergency residential shelter and community-based services to women, teens and their children while providing advocacy, counseling, family-based services and referrals. All services are free of charge and confidential.
