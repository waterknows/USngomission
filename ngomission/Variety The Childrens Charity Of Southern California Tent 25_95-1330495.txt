Formed in 1941, Variety the Children's Charity of Southern California is dedicated to providing lifesaving support for disabled, abused, physically-challenged and underprivileged children. Variety is made up of men and women primarily in the entertainment industry who raise the much-needed funds to help children in the Southern California community. The money raised in our community stays in our community, and our primary goal is to provide support wherever the need is greatest. In our 73 years of existence, we have raised more than $60 million to help thousands of children. Variety prides itself on being able to modify its agenda in order to meet new trends and evolving conditions; addressing each case in a timely, impartial manner.
