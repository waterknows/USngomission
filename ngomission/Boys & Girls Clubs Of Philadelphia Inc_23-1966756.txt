The Boys & Girls Clubs of Philadelphia enable all young people, especially those who need us most, to reach their full potential as productive, caring, responsible citizens. The Boys & Girls Clubs of Philadelphia provide a safe place to learn and grow; ongoing relationships with caring, adult professionals; life-enhancing programs and character development experiences; and hope and opportunity for more than 13,000 Philadelphia youth each year. The Boys & Girls Clubs of Philadelphia has served our city's youth since 1887. Our Germantown, Wissahickon, and Nicetown units are three of the original Clubs that were part of the founding of the Boys & Girls Clubs of America more than 100 years ago.
