Founded in 1922, Pikes Peak United Way is dedicated to addressing the underlying causes of problems and creating lasting change throughout El Paso and Teller counties. We are working to advance the common good by focusing on Successful Kids, Strong Families, Tools for Living and Community Wellness. Our goal is to create lasting changes that prevent problems from happening in the first place. Our experience tells us that the best way to help the most people is to get to the heart of our community's most serious problems. So, while we're helping those who need help now, we're also creating lasting change. This approach maximizes our effectiveness, because it allows us to improve lives not just in the short term, and not just on the surface, but in a lasting and meaningful way that benefits the entire community.
