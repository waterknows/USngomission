Bay Cliff is a year-round therapy and wellness center for children and adults with physical disabilities. Bay Cliff's priority program is a seven-week, summer therapy camp session serving children with orthopedic, speech, hearing, and vision disabilities. The children work towards goals of increased independence and living a fuller life. Bay Cliff also sponsors a week-long recreational camp for adults with physical disabilities, an adaptive paddling workshop, a health and wellness retreat for polio survivors, winter recreation for the children and adults that attend our summer programs, family programs for children with cerebral palsy, spina bifida, and obesity, and a professional development workshop for pediatric therapists.
