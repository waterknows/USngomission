The Crossroads Center was established in 1983 with a vision to serve the hungry and needy as they sought assistance. What started out as a soup kitchen serving one meal a day with only one bed, has evolved into a state-of-the-art facility providing unparalleled services in Central Nebraska. We offer so much more than a hot meal and a warm bed. We offer a Christ-centered, four-phase program of recovery to homeless men, women and children. We provide free food, shelter and clothing to our guests while they are completing our four-phase program. We served 43,829 meals last year to our guests and people in the community who were hungry.
