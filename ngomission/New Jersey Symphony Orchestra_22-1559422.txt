With its mission "to commit with equal passion to artistic excellence and engagement with its communities," the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra (NJSO) remains dedicated to providing world-class orchestral performance throughout the state, and to connect with its surrounding communities through a number of diverse educational engagement initiatives.



To fulfill this mission, the NJSO performs in seven venues and offers educational programming that allows it to reach nearly all 21 counties. Each year, the Orchestra typically engages more than 150,000 people, including 40,000 young people and their families. Through our great diversity of programming, we hope to ensure that music education and world-class orchestral music performance remain a vibrant and accessible part of the cultural fabric of the state of New Jersey.
