Founded in 1961, The United Way of Northeast Mississippi works to create opportunities to improve lives in the communities we serve. We provide funding to 69 health and human service agencies which are visited and reviewed by community volunteers each year. We serve over 100,000 individuals annually in a 7-county area.
