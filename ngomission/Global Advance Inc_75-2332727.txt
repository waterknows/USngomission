Founded in 1990, Global Advance (GA) provides training and resources for one million pastors and church leaders in needy areas of the world. We believe empowering national church leaders is the most strategic, cost effective, and culturally sensitive way to advance the Gospel. GA exists to help fulfill the Great Commission of Jesus Christ by empowering national church leaders to evangelize and disciple their own and surrounding nations. GA goes where these leaders are, to some of the most impoverished nations on earth, to provide them with the training, resources, and encouragement they so desperately need.
