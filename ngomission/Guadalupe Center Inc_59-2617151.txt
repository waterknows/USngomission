The Guadalupe Center began in 1982 as a soup kitchen to meet the immediate needs of impoverished families living in Immokalee, Florida. During these first years, it was noticed that an alarming number of children were falling behind in school. Thus, an after-school tutoring program, serving just 30 children, began operation in the soup kitchen. In 1984, the Center formed a Board of Trustees and the Guadalupe Center registered as a 501(c)(3) and educational programs became the primary focus. By the early 1990s, "Breaking the cycle of poverty through education" had become the Guadalupe Center's mission, offering the children of Immokalee a pipeline to prosperity through educational and special support programs strategically designed to start from six weeks of age and continue through college graduation. In 1996, with an eye toward finding a long-term solution to the economic disadvantages of the community, the Guadalupe Center opened the Early Childhood Education building, and began the program that is today the face of the Guadalupe Center. Today, the Guadalupe Center serves nearly 1,100 students from infancy through college graduation; 270 students in Early Childhood Education, 650 students in the Guadalupe After-school Program, and 170 high school and college students in Tutor Corps. The organization's focus is on the most critical periods of a child's education: early education, reducing the achievement gap, and college preparation and success. The programs are proven to break the cycle of poverty and provide the children of Immokalee with the hope of a prosperous and productive life.
