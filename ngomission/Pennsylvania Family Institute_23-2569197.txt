The Mission of the Pennsylvania Family Institute is to strengthen families by restoring to public life the traditional, foundational principles and values essential for the well-being of society. They are a research and education organization devoted to restoring these values to the state and nation by analyzing public policies and cultural trends for their impact on the family. They produce policy reports, promote responsible citizenship and work to promote unity among pro-family groups. The organization was founded in 1989.
