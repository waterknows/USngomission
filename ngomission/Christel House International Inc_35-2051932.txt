Founded in 1998, Christel House International works to help children around the world break the cycle of poverty and become self-sufficient, contributing members of their societies. Christel House builds and operates high social-impact learning centers in impoverished neighborhoods, which provide: quality education, nutritious meals, regular health care, life skills training and character development, as well as parent and community outreach. Children are taught the importance of caring, sharing and making a difference. Christel House believes that academic learning must be complemented with character development, a positive self-image and a commitment to caring for others. As a result, the work of Christel House will be multiplied many times over.
