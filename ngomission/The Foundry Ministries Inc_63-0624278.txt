The Foundry Rescue Mission & Recovery Center works to restore hope and rebuild the lives of the addict, the ex-inmate and the destitute through Christ-centered recovery, re-entry and rescue. Our vision for The Foundry Recovery Program is to channel God's amazing love and forgiveness to men and women battling drug addiction and substance abuse. Through His hands, these broken individuals can regain basic necessities, restore their hope and self-esteem, and achieve real, lasting change in their lives.
