Harvard Hillel is the catalyst for Jewish life at Harvard, serving the cultural, religious, educational, social, and political need of all segments of the undergraduate and graduate Jewish student communities. In addition, Harvard faculty, staff, and the general public are welcome and encouraged to participate and join in Hillel's activities. Harvard Hillel considers every Jewish student as an actor in and author of the on-going story of the Jewish people from ancient days until the present. Our mission, therefore, is to provide every Jewish Harvard student - without regard to ideological commitment or background - appropriate grounding for making meaningful Jewish choices in a complex and changing world.
