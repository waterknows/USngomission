California Youth Connection (CYC) is a youth led organization that develops leaders who empower each other and their communities to transform the foster care system through legislative and policy change. CYC was founded in 1988 by a group of foster youth and supportive adults to provide a vehicle for California foster youth to learn leadership and advocacy skills and to engage directly with policymakers to improve the foster care system. 

Every year, CYC serves more than 500 foster youth members, ages 14-24, through 32 county-based chapters throughout the state.
