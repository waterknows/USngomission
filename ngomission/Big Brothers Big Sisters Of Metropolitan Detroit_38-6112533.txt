The Big Brothers Big Sisters of Metropolitan Detroit Mission is to provide children facing adversity with safe, strong and enduring, professionally supported one-to-one relationships that change their lives for the better, forever. For more than 100 years, Big Brothers Big Sisters has operated under the belief that inherent in every child is the ability to succeed and thrive in life. As the nation's largest donor and volunteer supported mentoring network, Big Brothers Big Sisters makes meaningful, monitored matches between adult volunteers (Bigs) and children (Littles), ages 6 through 18, in communities across the country. We develop positive relationships that have a direct and lasting effect on the lives of young people.
