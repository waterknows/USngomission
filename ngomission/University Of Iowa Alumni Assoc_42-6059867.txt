Founded in 1950, the University of Iowa Alumni Association is the main resource for all loyal Hawkeyes who want to remain engaged with the University of Iowa community. We work to strengthen the University of Iowa through alumni engagement. We do this by creating an active interest on the part of the school's alumni through communications, alumni events, and programs.
