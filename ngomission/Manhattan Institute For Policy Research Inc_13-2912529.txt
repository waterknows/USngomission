For 30 years, the Manhattan Institute has been an important force in shaping American political culture and developing ideas that foster economic choice and individual responsibility. We have supported and publicized research on our era's most challenging public policy issues: taxes, health care, energy, the legal system, policing, crime, homeland security, urban life, education, race, culture, and many others. Our work has won new respect for market-oriented policies and helped make reform a reality. We have cultivated a staff of senior fellows who work in the Institute's nine policy centers, which study and promote reform in areas ranging from health care, higher education, legal policy, and urban development to race relations, immigration, energy, and counterterrorism.
