Since 1983, Falmouth Service Center (FSC) has worked hand in hand with the community to educate, support, and improve the quality of life of Upper Cape residents in need. We recognize the needs are as diverse as our clients. Our multi-service agency therefore covers a wide range. A major component of the program is an extensive food pantry that residents/clients may visit once every three weeks as needed. In addition, financial assistance, in conjunction with budget management workshops, is available to clients who need housing assistance and/or help paying utilities. Additionally, the Falmouth Service Center offers the community nutritional education and cooking classes in cooperation with the Barnstable County Extension.
