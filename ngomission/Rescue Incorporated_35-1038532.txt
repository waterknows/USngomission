Hope Ministries was initially founded as Hope Rescue Mission in 1954 by Tobe E. Schmucker under the direction of the Mennonite Board of Missions. Hope Ministries seeks to transform hearts, minds and lives by engaging families and individuals in a Christ-centered, grace-based process of examining their current realities, envisioning their future possibilities, and enabling action to achieve their desired futures. Hope envisions a community in which every adult and child has access to the love, support and resources they need to be healthy mentally, physically, emotionally and spiritually.
