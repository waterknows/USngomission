The Mario Lemieux Foundation was created in 1993 by hockey legend Mario Lemieux. In that year, Mario was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease. After a successful battle with Hodgkin's disease, Mario is now 20 years cancer free and his experience led him to focus on ways to assist those not so fortunate. He devotes much of his time to the Foundation raising funds to help reach the ultimate goal: a cure for cancer. The mission of the Mario Lumieux Foundation is to fund promising research projects conducted by the most talented scientists in the field.
