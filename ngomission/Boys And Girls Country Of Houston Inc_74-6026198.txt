Boys and Girls Country was established in 1971. Our mission is to change the lives of children from families in crisis by loving and nurturing them in a Christian environment, raising them to become self-sustaining and contributing adults. Our children are primarily from the greater Houston area. Boys and Girls Country has capacity to serve 48 boys and 40 girls, ages 5-18, a total of 88 children at any one time. Not included in this number are 72 others each year who are still supported by the Home after they have graduated from high school and gone on to college, trade school, the military, or first jobs. We have been home for over 1,375 children during our history.
