Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) of Collin County advocates for the best interest of children in foster care. Since 1994, we have served 100% of the abused and neglected children removed from their homes in Collin County. Within 24 hours of the removal, CASA is appointed by District Court Judges as the child's guardian ad litem. As the child's official voice in court, CASA works tirelessly to make sure the child (and parents) receives the services needed and the child's case moves through the system as quickly as possible. The goal is for each child to be reunited with family if appropriate or to be placed in a safe and loving forever home if reunification is not possible.
