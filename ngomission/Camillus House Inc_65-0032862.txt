Established by the Little Brothers of the Good Shepherd in 1960, Camillus House has grown steadily over the years from a small overnight shelter into a full service center offering a full continuum of care for the poor and homeless. Committed to the teachings of Jesus Christ, Camillus House strives to provide Christian hospitality and respect for life through direct services of food, clothing, shelter, addiction counseling, and health care to the poor and homeless of South Florida. Camillus House offers a second chance to the desperate, the lonely, and the ones society has left behind. We become their family, giving them the hope and support they need to begin the long, difficult transition to a new life and self-sufficiency.
