The Family Center is dedicated to helping individuals and families enhance their own skills, recognize their potential, and reach their own goals. For over a century, the Family Center has helped to strengthen and empower families because we believe that strong, healthy families create strong communities. We work to provide the most effective counseling, education, and mentoring services needed to support, strengthen, and enhance the quality of life for children, individuals, and families within our community.
