Chicago Youth Centers (CYC) is Chicago's largest independent, locally based, multi-site youth services organization. It was founded in 1956 by two visionaries, Chicago businessmen Elliott Donnelley and Sidney Epstein, who wanted young people living in poverty to have an alternative to the streets. CYC invests in youth in underserved communities in Chicago to help them discover and realize their full potential. CYC offers services to children and youth, ages 3-19, in seven neighborhoods (Bridgeport, Grand Boulevard/Bronzeville, Humboldt Park, North Lawndale, South Shore, Riverdale/Altgeld and Roseland) through nine community centers and at CYC-Camp Rosenthal in Dowagiac, Michigan.
