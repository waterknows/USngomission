Since 2001, The Presidential Prayer Team has been the source millions of Americans have turned to for encouragement and inspiration to pray for America, our President, our national leaders and our Armed Forces. 

We are a national ministry dedicated to a focused mission of encouraging, inspiring and practicing prayer on behalf of our President, nation's leaders and our troops. We also seek to be a catalyst in the development of a robust prayer lifestyle. We do this by finding and providing tools to encourage prayer - through email, web, mobile phones and other communication tools. Ultimately, we believe that prayer will transform our nation, one heart at a time.
