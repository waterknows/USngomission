Ohio United Way is the voluntary state association of United Ways across Ohio. Representing local United Ways around the state, the association works to promote the public policy interest of our members, provides them with educational opportunities and leads statewide initiatives designed to improve Ohio communities. Ohio's greatest community challenges cannot be solved by money alone. Today, United Ways are building upon their greatest resource to improve community conditions: the power of community collaboration. Local United Ways build productive relationships between philanthropists, the business community, the nonprofit community and the public sector to identify and implement solutions to community needs.
