The ITCF raises funds in the American philanthropic community to support the operations, facilities and programs of the 14 Israel Tennis Centers (ITC) throughout Israel. Through the discipline of tennis we strive to improve the lives of children in one of the most conflicted regions of the world. By teaching the life skills of self-reliance, perseverance and focus, the ITC fosters sustainable values of self-esteem, character and tolerance, creating a positive impact on the children, their families and the world for generations to come. For more than 35 years, the ITC has been helping children and teens living in poverty, new immigrants, coexistence programs, youth at-risk and those with developmental and intellectual disabilities. The ITC was founded in 1976 by six business leaders to achieve the goal of helping children and teens in Israel facing extreme obstacles. To date we have served over 400,000 children and teens and are currently serving 20,000 annually at the centers.
