Founded in 1999, Building Goodness Foundation (BGF) works to build community and improve lives. Their purpose is to bring together volunteers from every part of the construction industry to design and build structures for communities in need. Together with their partners, they use donations of time, money, materials, and expertise to build clinics, schools, community centers, and specialized housing for those who need them most, both in their own community and around the world. Non-construction volunteers are a critical part of their team. And, beyond the bricks and mortar of a new structure, BGF volunteers build lasting relationships with the people they are helping, relationships that profoundly improve the lives of all involved.
