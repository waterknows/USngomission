Sacred Heart Nativity School (SHNS) strives to afford our students with one of the most important opportunities - a high quality Catholic education. SHNS is dedicated to providing quality, low-cost private education to at-risk youth in the 6th through 8th grades. It is an academically challenging and a highly structured environment. These youth, 96% Latino, are in danger of dropping out of school and risking a lifetime of poor outcomes. At SHNS our students benefit from a rich and integrated environment where they learn not only reading, math and science, but also the importance of hard work, ethical leadership, compassion for others and responsible citizenship.
