United Way of Etowah County Alabama is improving lives by mobilizing the caring power of our community. We see a safe community with strong families working together, successful children moving toward becoming productive citizens, and a community where the disabled are reaching their potential & senior citizens can maintain their independence. We recognize a community of diverse people with a shared vision of caring for one another.
