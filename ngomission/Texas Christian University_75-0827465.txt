Founded in 1873, Texas Christian University (TCU) educates individuals to think and act as ethical leaders and responsible citizens in the global community. TCU is committed to creating a world-class, values-centered university experience. Students benefit from the strengths and resources of larger institutions but in a small college environment. They can choose from more than 100 undergraduate areas of study, participate in innovative programs such as entrepreneurship and nurse anesthesia, and take part in service learning. With a 14:1 student/faculty ratio and a teacher-scholar model that results in close, mentoring relationships, TCU fosters discovery, creativity and leadership.
