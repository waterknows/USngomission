Since 1966, The Repertory Theatre of St. Louis (The Rep) has been the region's premier live, professional theatre. The Rep is dedicated to producing live theatre of superior quality. In celebrating the joy of live performance, this theatre is committed to building and sustaining a vital connection among all of its stakeholders. Hundreds of productions have graced The Rep's stages since its inception. The Rep's performance home since its founding, the Loretto-Hilton Center for the Performing Arts is one of the St. Louis area's architectural gems and a remarkably flexible public space. In 2005, with the addition of The Rep's Off-Ramp performance series, we found a second home, the Grandel Theatre in Grand Center.
