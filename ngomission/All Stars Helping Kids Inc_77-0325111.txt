Founded in 1989, the mission of All Stars Helping Kids is to promote a safe, healthy, rigorous learning environment for disadvantaged kids in low-income communities. We fulfill this mission by assisting past and present professional athletes, corporations, and individuals with their philanthropic efforts, and allowing them to fully experience philanthropy through donations, volunteering, and networking events.
