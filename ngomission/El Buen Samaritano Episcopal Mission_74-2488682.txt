El Buen Samaritano is an outreach ministry of the Episcopal Diocese of Texas committed to helping Latino and other families in Central Texas lead healthy, productive and secure lives through high-quality and affordable healthcare, education and financial security services. While we were born out of the Episcopal Church, our goal, as a mission, is to continue to act as the Good Samaritan welcoming the stranger, tending to their wounds, aiding in basic needs and bridging the gap between cultures.
