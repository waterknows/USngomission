The Jewish Federation of Cincinnati brings our community together to care for Jews in Cincinnati, in Israel,

and around the world, and to develop opportunities for each of us to embrace a Jewish life. We are the largest Jewish non-profit fundraising organization in Cincinnati, charged with building community resources, leadership and trust. We were founded on the Jewish people's commitment to tzedekah- that it is righteous and just to do right by others. For 112 years we have been helping to create a spirit of giving and hope for ourselves and around the world. Our work can be divided into three primary areas: building resources and investing them wisely; building leadership and participation; and building trust and collaboration.
