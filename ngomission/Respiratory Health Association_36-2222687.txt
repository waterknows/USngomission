The mission of Respiratory Health Association of Metropolitan Chicago (RHAMC) is to promote healthy lungs and fight lung disease through research, advocacy and education. To that end and through community-based interventions, RHAMC serves an estimated one million Cook County residents living with asthma, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema and other lung diseases. Respiratory Health Association was founded more than a century ago in 1906. Today, RHAMC has branched out to address all lung diseases and offer services throughout metropolitan Chicago and across the state. Through the years, the organization has championed various initiatives and carried several different names, but has always maintained its commitment to community lung health.
