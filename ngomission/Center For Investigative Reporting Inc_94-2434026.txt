Founded in 1977, the Center for Investigative Reporting is the nation's oldest nonprofit investigative news organization, producing multimedia reporting that has impact and is relevant to people's lives. Building on our long track record of award-winning print, broadcast and web reporting, CIR is now seeking to help lead the way in transforming journalism for the 21st century. CIR is working to ensure that high-quality, credible, unique journalism does not die, but flourishes. CIR's newest venture is California Watch, a major new reporting initiative to produce in-depth, high impact multimedia journalism specific to California and to engage the public on issues of critical importance to the state.
