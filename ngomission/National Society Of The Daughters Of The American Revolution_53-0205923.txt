Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR), founded in 1890 and headquartered in Washington, D.C., is a volunteer women's service organization dedicated to promoting patriotism, preserving American history, and securing America's future through better education for children. DAR members volunteer more than 60,000 hours annually to veteran patients, award over $150,000 in scholarships and financial aid each year to students, and support schools for the underprivileged with annual donations exceeding one million dollars. Any woman 18 years or older-regardless of race, religion, or ethnic background - who can prove lineal descent from a patriot of the American Revolution - is eligible for membership.
