Incorporated in 1968, the Association of Graduates (AOG) of the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) is the alumni association of the USAFA, dedicated to serving our graduates and members, enhancing the heritage of this premier institution and enriching the cadet experience by funding programs not supported by appropriated funds. The AOG's three-part mission is: to work in partnership with the Academy to produce and foster graduates with an enduring commitment to integrity, excellence, and service to country; to provide leadership, communication, and support to all the Academy's graduates, and promote camaraderie among them; and to promote the Academy's heritage, common tradition, and the accomplishments of its graduates.
