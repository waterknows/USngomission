COCA (Center of Creative Arts) has been providing meaningful arts experiences to St. Louisans and their families since 1987. COCA's multidisciplinary and multicultural arts programs include performances in our 400-seat theatre; educational classes, camps, and workshops serving individuals aged 6 months through adult; artists' residencies; exhibits of contemporary art in the Millstone Gallery at COCA; and an extensive outreach program offered to low-income youth through our nationally recognized Urban Arts Program.
