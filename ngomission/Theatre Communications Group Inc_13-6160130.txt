The mission of Theatre Communications Group (TCG) is to strengthen, nurture and promote the professional not-for-profit American theatre. Over the last 45 years, TCG's constituency has grown from a tiny network of groundbreaking theatres to over 460 members across the country, as well as over 17,000 individuals nationwide. Today, our programs further our core values of fostering connection, embracing diversity and supporting artistry in the American theatre. In all our endeavors, TCG seeks to increase the organizational efficiency of our member theatres, cultivate and celebrate the artistic talent and achievements of the field, and promote a larger public understanding of and appreciation for the theatre.
