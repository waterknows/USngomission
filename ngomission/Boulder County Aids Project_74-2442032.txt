Founded in 1985, the mission of Boulder County AIDS Project (BCAP) is twofold: to provide support, advocacy and education to those in our community who are infected with or affected by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and to serve as an outreach and information center to prevent further transmission of HIV and the resulting Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Boulder County AIDS Project (BCAP) serves men, women and children who are HIV positive living in Boulder, Broomfield, Clear Creek and Gilpin Counties. All care services are free, confidential and offered within a non-judgmental environment. Care services include case management, access to medical care, financial assistance, food bank, volunteer support, support groups, and pro bono professional support services.
