Since 2000, Step Up For Students (formerly The Florida School Choice Fund) has been working to empower low-income parents with educational options for their children. The mission of Step Up For Students is to provide legislatively authorized K-12 scholarships and related support to give disadvantaged families the freedom to choose the best learning options for their children. Step Up For Students seeks to spur improvements in the K-12 education system by equipping all of Florida's parents with the tools to seek the best education for their children through educational option programs - such as the Step Up For Students Corporate Tax Credit Scholarship Program and the Personal Learning Scholarship Account for students with special needs.
