Churches United in Ministry (CHUM) is a human services agency sponsored and governed by 39 Duluth congregations. CHUM began in 1973 when ten Central Hillside congregations pooled resources to assist low-income people in Duluth. The organizational goals are to provide basic needs services for homeless and marginalized members of our community while working to effect changes which will eliminate the need for our services. CHUM provides core social safety net programs which include emergency food, shelter, advocacy, and outreach to over 7,000 hungry, homeless and low-income people each year. Housing advocates and street case managers provide stabilization services through case management programs for homeless or imminently homeless families and single adults. CHUM's congregational outreach and community organizing efforts center on social justice issues relating to homelessness, poverty and employment.
