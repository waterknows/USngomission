The Minnesota Zoo Foundation's primary purpose is to raise funds for the Minnesota Zoo. Founded in 1978, the Minnesota Zoo exists to connect people, animals, and the natural world. We are dedicated to inspiring guests to act on behalf of wildlife and wild lands. To accomplish this, we provide award-winning recreational, educational, and conservation programs, locally, nationally, and internationally.
