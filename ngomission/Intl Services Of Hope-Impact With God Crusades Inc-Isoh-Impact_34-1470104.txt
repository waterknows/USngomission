ISOH/IMPACT (formerly known as International Services of Hope & Impact With God Crusades) is a community based organization whose mandate is devoted to ensuring a brighter future for children. ISOH/IMPACT was designed to be the focal point of a new and broader framework for community organization and child advocacy. ISOH was founded in 1991 as an international organization dedicated to reaching families living in poverty throughout Haiti and Guatemala with shipments of food and clothing. IMPACT was founded in 1958 to help families in crisis through evangelism, crusades, counseling and community outreach. Since merging in 1998, ISOH/IMPACT has been engaged in community education, advocacy, resource development, and community organizing.
