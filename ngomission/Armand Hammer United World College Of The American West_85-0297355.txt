United World College - USA (UWC-USA) makes education a force to unite people, nations, and cultures for peace and a sustainable future. UWC-USA was founded in 1982 in Montezuma, New Mexico through the philanthropy of the late Dr. Armand Hammer and is part of an international movement that now includes 11 two-year pre-university residential schools worldwide offering the International Baccalaureate Diploma curriculum plus a three-year tertiary college of rural development and agriculture in Venezuela. While the UWC schools share a mission statement and a common philosophy, individual characteristics shape each college into a distinct community. UWC-USA enrolls just over 200 students; 150 from more than 80 countries outside the U.S., and 50 from the United States.
