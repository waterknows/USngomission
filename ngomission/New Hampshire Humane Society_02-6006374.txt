The New Hampshire Humane Society (NHHS) was founded in 1900. As one of the largest and oldest humane societies in New Hampshire, we provide care for more than 1,000 animals each year, offer a low cost spay/neuter clinic, assist with cruelty investigations and offer community outreach programs for more than 32 cities and towns in the NH Lakes Region. Our mission and purpose is: to find responsible and caring forever homes; to provide shelter and care for lost, abandoned and unwanted animals; to be advocates for animals - speaking for those that cannot speak for themselves; to implement educational programs and provide services to promote responsible pet ownership and the bond between animals and humans; and to prevent cruelty to animals.
