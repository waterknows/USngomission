Established in 1953, the Idaho Youth Ranch provides troubled children and families a bridge to a valued, responsible and productive future. We help each child find the hope, vision, courage and will to succeed. We provide stability, opportunity and security. We encourage growth and offer a chance to develop confidence, independence, esteem and respect. We teach values, responsibility and self discipline in honest, caring environments. We believe in family, work, accountability, education and responsible behavior.
