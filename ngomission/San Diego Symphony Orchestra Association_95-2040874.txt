The San Diego Symphony Orchestra is committed to presenting innovative concert programming of superior quality at the Joan and Irwin Jacobs Music Center. The Symphony makes music an integral part of the cultural and intellectual fabric of the San Diego region, valued by and relevant to all its residents.On October 29th, 2013, the Symphony made its long-anticipated Carnegie Hall debut, and then continued on to China for its first tour of that nation in the Symphony's 100+ year history. Beginning October 2012, the Symphony undertook an unprecedented two-year experiment in community and cross-cultural music collaboration. The Symphony's "Your Song, Your Story" project concluded in July 2014 with an original multimedia piece incorporating songs, stories and dances contributed by San Diegans of all racial and socio-economic backgrounds. The piece is a celebration of the city's collective experience, and explores unique facets of our residents' heritage.
