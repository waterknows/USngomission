We conduct silent, residential meditations courses and retreats that teach Vipassana mediation. Vipassana, which means to see things as they really are, is one of India's most ancient techniques of meditation. It was taught in India more than 2500 years ago as a universal remedy for universal ills, an Art of Living.
