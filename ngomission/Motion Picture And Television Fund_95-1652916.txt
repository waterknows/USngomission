Established in 1921 as the Motion Picture Relief Fund, the Motion Picture and Television Fund (MPTF) enriches the lives of people in our Southern California entertainment community by continuously evolving to meet their heath and human services needs. We are dedicated to offering programs and charitable services which are provided with compassion and respect for the dignity of the whole person. Since its inception, the MPTF has flourished into a comprehensive service organization which operates six outpatient health centers throughout the greater Los Angeles area; a children's center; a retirement community, health plans and much, much more. Today, the MPTF's mission remains the same: to protect and preserve the health and quality of life of those who devote so much of their lives to a career in the entertainment industry.
