The Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN) is the nation's largest anti-sexual assault organization. RAINN operates the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1.800.656.HOPE and rainn.org and publicizes the hotlines' free, confidential services; educates the public about sexual assault; and leads national efforts to prevent sexual assault, improve services to victims and ensure that rapists are brought to justice. RAINN is a frequent resource for television, radio and print news outlets - as well as local, state and national policymakers, law enforcement and rape treatment professionals - on the issues related to rape and sexual assault.
