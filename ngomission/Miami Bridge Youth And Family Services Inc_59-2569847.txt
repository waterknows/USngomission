The Miami Bridge Youth and Family Services mission is to promote positive youth development, and strengthen and support families to enable children to actualize their full potential to become productive community members. When kids need a place to go, The Bridge is there to provide respite care in its two emergency shelter facilities. We serve more than 900 children each year. The Bridge provides emergency shelter, food and, just as importantly, counseling for troubled youths and their families. The Bridge works to rescue kids from lives of victimization and crime, and in so doing, helps our community ensure that these kids have the opportunity to become productive members of our society.
