Founded in 1913, Fontenelle Forest is one of Nebraska's oldest conservation organizations and one of the largest private nature centers in the nation. FF owns and manages two nature centers: Fontenelle Forest Nature Center in Bellevue and Neale Woods in Omaha. The properties encompass nearly 2,000 acres of forest, prairie and wetlands along the Missouri River in the geographically significant Loess Hills. The mission of Fontenelle Forest is to provide a place where people can experience and enjoy the quiet wild of nature. We want to inspire current and future generations to care for the natural world.
