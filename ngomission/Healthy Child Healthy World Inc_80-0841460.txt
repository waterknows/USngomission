Founded in 1991, Healthy Child Healthy World (formerly the Children's Health Environmental Coalition) is dedicated to protecting the health and well-being of children from harmful environmental exposures. We educate parents and caregivers, support protective policies, and engage households and communities by providing access to critical information that encourages smarter lifestyle choices to reduce toxic chemicals exposure. Our programs and initiatives are centered around expanding awareness of environmental hazards to children's health; helping the public learn about healthier practices, solutions, and products in the marketplace; creating standards and policies for safer products, foods, materials, and chemicals used in the home; and advocating for and supporting corporate policies and governmental legislation that protect children from environmental risks. Our vision is a world where every child has the opportunity to grow up in a healthy and safe environment.
