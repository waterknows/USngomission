Since 1946, the Middle East Institute (MEI) has been an important conduit of information between Middle Eastern nations and American policymakers, organizations and the public. We strive to increase knowledge of the Middle East among our own citizens and to promote understanding between the peoples of the Middle East and America. Today we play a vital and unique role in expanding the dialogue beyond Washington, D.C., and actively with organizations in the Middle East. MEI houses the George Camp Keiser Library, which has the largest English-language collection on the Middle East outside of the Library of Congress. In addition, MEI publishes The Middle East Journal and offers courses in Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, and Turkish.
