The Jewish Federation of Greater Long Beach and West Orange County anchor the Jewish Community Partnership. Since 1948, the Jewish Federation has worked to preserve Jewish life and strengthen Jewish advocacy, while also providing assistance to people in need and at risk, where they are. Collaborating with individuals and across the community, we connect those who want help to those who need it most. More than fundraisers, we are expert facilitators who identify, convene and nourish the critical partners, programs and services that touch thousands of lives, every day. In your neighborhood, your country, and around the world.
