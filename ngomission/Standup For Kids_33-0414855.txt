STANDUP FOR KIDS (SUFK), founded in 1990, is a 501(c)(3) national non-profit charitable organization dedicated to improving the lives of homeless and at-risk youth and young adults. Its National Headquarters is located in Atlanta, Georgia. The core mission is to end the cycle of youth homelessness throughout the United States. STANDUP FOR KIDS carries out this mission every day in cities across America through our national volunteers, who go to the streets in order to find, stabilize and otherwise help homeless and street kids improve their lives by providing and connecting them with life-saving services. The mission is also furthered through deterrence and resource programs provided in schools and via the internet. All facets of this mission are guided by the mandate that our volunteers shall tell the kids they care about them and then, at every turn, prove it. STANDUP FOR KIDS continuously strives to provide life-saving and outreach services to homeless, street kids and at-risk youth
