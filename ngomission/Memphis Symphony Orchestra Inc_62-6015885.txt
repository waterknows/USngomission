The Memphis Symphony Orchestra's commitment to meaningful musical experiences is the heart of its past, present, and future. The Memphis Symphony Orchestra educates and inspires the community through music, serving the community in multiple ways that extend well beyond the concert hall. Through education and community programs such as Young People's Concerts, coaching in middle and high schools, ensembles in schools and nursing homes, Family Tunes & Tales at libraries, Drum Circles at special needs and at-risk community groups, the MSO encourages life-long learning. The MSO is an integral part of the cultural, educational, and economic life of Memphis and has been since 1952.
