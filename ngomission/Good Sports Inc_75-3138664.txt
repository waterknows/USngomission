Good Sports helps to lay the foundation for healthy, active lifestyles by providing athletic equipment, footwear, and apparel to disadvantaged young people nationwide. Youth sports programs have faced severe budget cuts in most geographies and many organizations respond by shifting the costs to families in the form of higher fees. In some communities, this can effectively exclude disadvantaged children from joining teams. By partnering with sporting goods manufacturers, Good Sports is able to provide equipment, apparel, and footwear to programs in need. This lowers their costs which helps them keep fees affordable, create more scholarships, enhance the quality of their activities, and introduce new sports into their schools or organizations.
