Big Brothers Big Sisters of San Diego County is celebrating 53 years of serving children, ages 7-18, throughout San Diego by providing unique, one-to-one mentoring . Children are served through two core programs: Community-Based and Site-Based Mentoring. The kids served primarily come families facing many obstacles; single parent and/or low income homes, homelessness, children with a parent in prison or children of deployable military parents. These kids are more vulnerable to influences leading to violence, delinquency, drug and alcohol abuse, and school failure. Big Brothers Big Sisters is a solution that works to solve these challenges through one-to-one consistent mentoring offered by caring adults to help change the way children grow up. Our organization has been recognized as being top of their class for excellent service, fiscal responsibility, and quality standards: # 1 Non Profit for At -Risk Youth - Philanthropedia and San Diego named by BBBS as a Gold Standard Award Winner
