Founded in 1991 by the Charles Koch Foundation, Youth Entrepreneurs (formerly Youth Entrepreneurs Kansas) teaches students business and entrepreneurial education to help them prosper and become contributing members of society. We believe teaching entrepreneurship better prepares students for success in business and other future career and education endeavors. We stimulate economic thinking skills; encourage creative, intelligent risk-taking; provide practical business experience; and instill independence and personal responsibility.
