The Mid America Assistance Coalition (MAAC) was created in 1985 from the merger of emergency assistance agencies with a history of community service dating back to 1974. With the mission to strengthen the social service community through information systems, training, and advocacy, MAAC is a national model for effective coordination of emergency assistance organizations and homeless service providers. Its role is to make a complex social service system as efficient and accessible as possible. With the help of the community, this is done by applying creative ideas and technology to find solutions to community needs. Throughout its 25 years, MAAC is a proven leading agency supporting social service communities.
