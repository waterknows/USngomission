United Way of Madison County is working to create the kind of community we all want to live in. Where every child graduates and achieves their dreams, where every person has a good job that allows them to fully provide for their family, and where every family is stronger because they are healthy. We work to improve the quality of life in our community by engaging people and organizations to advance education, income and health outcomes for all. We invite you to join with us. Together, united, we can inspire hope and create a better future for everyone that calls Madison County home. That's what it means to LIVE UNITED.
