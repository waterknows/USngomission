MEDA (Metropolitan Economic Development Association) was created in 1971 by a group of Twin Cities business leaders to address the issues of rapidly rising poverty, crime and unemployment in a new and improved way. MEDA provides assistance to businesses owned and managed by ethnic minorities. Unique among economic development organizations, MEDA's services are directed toward new and existing businesses whose owners are committed to making an impact through: job creation; their firms' growth and profitability; and community involvement.
