Founded in 1987, the mission of the "I Have a Dream" Foundation - Los Angeles (IHADLA) is to work with at risk youth (our "Dreamers") in their schools, to get them through high school and into college or vocational school. In doing so, we work to end the poverty that defines these inner city communities. Providing the only long-term, whole life program in the Los Angeles area, IHADLA adopts an entire grade at the elementary level, and stays with that class for at least ten years, through high school graduation, providing a program of mentoring, tutoring, academic support, mental health services, and cultural enrichment. At the end of our program, each Dreamer is guaranteed an $8,000 ($2,000 per year) scholarship from us to go towards their higher education, be that a two-year college, a four-year college, or vocational school.
