For 87 years, United Way of Greater Houston has been the social services safety net for the Greater Houston Area. United Way is a leader and trusted partner in improving lives, tackling key community social issues, and making a lasting difference. United Way of Greater Houston touches one of every two lives in the Bay Area, Fort Bend, Harris, Montgomery and Waller counties. United Way of Greater Houston seeks to increase the organized capacity of people to care for themselves and others and to mobilize our community to make lasting improvements in critical needs areas. We are the only organization in Houston embracing the entire circle of life by focusing on: children and youth, families and neighborhoods, seniors, and people rebuilding their lives.
