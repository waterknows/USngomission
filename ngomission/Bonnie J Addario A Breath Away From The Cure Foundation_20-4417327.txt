The mission of the Bonnie J. Addario Lung Cancer Foundation is to extend and enhance the lives of patients and families affected by Lung Cancer. Our ultimate goal is to be the global leader fighting Lung Cancer and the largest source of non-profit funding dedicated to turning Lung Cancer into a manageable, chronic disease and ultimately, a curable disease. Arising from the experience of our founder, the Bonnie J. Addario Lung Cancer Foundation will always be patient focused, funded and driven. We believe that patients, individually and collectively, hold the key to our mission's success. We are in a hurry to increase the Lung Cancer patient survival rate, stagnant and inexcusably low (15.5%) for too long due to the stigma of Lung Cancer as a smoker's disease.
