The American Forest Foundation works on-the-ground with families, teachers, and elected officials to promote stewardship and protect our nation's forest heritage. AFF is committed to creating a future where North American forests are sustained by the public that understand and values the social, economic, and environmental benefits they provide to our communities, our nation, and the world.
