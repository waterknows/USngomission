The mission of VisionTrust International is to develop orphaned and neglected children into mature Christians equipped to live in their own culture. We do this by enabling Christian nationals to meet the physical, educational, emotional and spiritual needs of these children. In every country of operation, VisionTrust strives to meet children's physical and nutritional needs by providing regular meals and food supplements, potable water, and basic medical and emergency health care. Educational needs are met by school tuition assistance, tutoring at our after-school Learning Centers and daycare programs. Spiritual discipleship occurs through Sunday school attendance and Learning Center Bible and ethics curriculum. VisionTrust currently serves over 14,500 children around the world with 10 Transitional Homes, 18 schools, and 135 Learning Centers.
