Founded in 1990, the National Network to End Domestic Violence (NNEDV) is a social change organization that is dedicated to creating a social, political and economic environment in which violence against women no longer exists. NNEDV offers a range of programs and initiatives to address the complex causes and far-reaching consequences of domestic violence. Through cross-sector collaborations and corporate partnerships, we offer support to victims of domestic violence who are escaping abusive relationships, and empowers survivors to build new lives, work closely with its members to understand the ongoing and emerging needs of domestic violence victims and advocacy programs, and provide state coalitions with critical information and resources.
