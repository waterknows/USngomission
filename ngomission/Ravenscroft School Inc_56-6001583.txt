Founded in 1862 by members of Christ Episcopal Church, Ravenscroft School, guided by our legacy of excellence, nurtures individual potential and prepares students to thrive in a complex and interdependent world. Ravenscroft is composed of three educational divisions: Lower School, Middle School and Upper School with individual directors. Ravenscroft has a long tradition of educating students and preparing them for college as well as life's challenges. It is with the support and guidance provided by so many leaders within the Ravenscroft community that the School has prospered into one of the finest pre-kindergarten through grade twelve independent schools in the southern United States.
