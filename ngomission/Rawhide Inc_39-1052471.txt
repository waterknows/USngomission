Since 1965, Rawhide Boys Ranch has helped hundreds of troubled teen boys change their lives. Located in the heart of Wisconsin along the scenic Wolf River, Rawhide is a faith-based, residential care center dedicated to changing the lives of troubled teen boys. The family living model, along with other program offerings, sets Rawhide apart from other residential care centers by providing a home-like setting with Houseparents and Resident Instructors, and offering moral guidance, encouragement, therapeutic counseling, specialized education, work experience and fun activities. Rawhide also creates a unique treatment plan for each student with specific outcome goals in order to create more opportunities for success after they leave Rawhide.
