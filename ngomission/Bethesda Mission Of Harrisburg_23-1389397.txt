Since 1914, Bethesda Mission has been a missionary arm of the local church, reaching out to men, women and children of all races, nationalities and creeds, providing the poor and homeless with shelter, food, clothing, sharing the good news of Jesus Christ and disciplining them in the Christian life. Our sevenfold ministries include a Men's Shelter; Women & Children's Shelter; Youth Center; Mobile Mission; Medical/Dental Clinics; Transitional Living; and Rural Outreach. Each fall into two overall categories; first, Samaritan services that offer necessities and encouragement for basic survival; and second, long term rehabilitation and mentoring programs, for men and women struggling with addiction and abuse, providing the opportunity for a new life of stability and fulfillment, and, for positive influence and development of our children and youth.
