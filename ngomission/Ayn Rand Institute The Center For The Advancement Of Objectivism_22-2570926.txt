The Ayn Rand Institute (ARI) works to introduce young people to Ayn Rand's novels, to support scholarship and research based on her ideas, and to promote the principles of reason, rational self-interest, individual rights and laissez-faire capitalism to the widest possible audience. ARI seeks to spearhead a cultural renaissance that will reverse the anti-reason, anti-individualism, anti-freedom, anti-capitalist trends in today's culture. The major battleground in this fight for reason and capitalism is the educational institutions-high schools and, above all, the universities, where students learn the ideas that shape their lives. Ayn Rand's philosophy-known as Objectivism-holds that historical trends are the inescapable product of philosophy.
