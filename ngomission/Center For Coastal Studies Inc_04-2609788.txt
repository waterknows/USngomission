The Center for Coastal Studies believes the preservation of marine and coastal habitats and the recovery of species is crucial to the health of all life. At the heart of our mission is conservation biology, what sociobiologist E.O. Wilson calls, "a discipline with a deadline," for what we do not save today may be gone tomorrow." Our mission is as follows: to conduct scientific research with emphasis on marine mammals of the western North Atlantic and on the coastal and marine habitats and resources of the Gulf of Maine; to promote stewardship of coastal and marine ecosystems; to conduct educational activities and to provide educational resources that encourage the responsible use and conservation of coastal and marine ecosystems; and to collaborate with other institutions and individuals whenever possible to advance the Center's mission.
