Foxcroft School, founded in 1914, is a college-preparatory boarding and day school for girls in grades 9-12. Foxcroft provides a residential learning experience for girls in which academic excellence, leadership, responsibility, and integrity are our highest values. Foxcroft is, by design, a small, residential school. The 2008-2009 student body is 76 percent boarding students with a total of 185 girls from 22 states, Washington D.C. and 12 foreign countries. Some 16 percent are U.S. students of color, 16 percent are international students and about 25 percent receive more than $1.2 million of financial aid. In addition, 26 percent of the students are related to alumnae - an impressive testament to the relationship between the school and its graduates.
