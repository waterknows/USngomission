Founded in 1976, the French-American Foundation is the principal non-government link between France and the United States at leadership levels and across the full range of the French-American relationship. The purpose of the French-American Foundation is to strengthen the French-American relationship as a vital component of the trans-Atlantic partnership. This mission is accomplished through a variety of initiatives that include multi-year policy programs, conferences on issues of French-American interest, and leadership and professional exchanges of decision-makers from France and the United States.
