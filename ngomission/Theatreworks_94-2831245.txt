With a reputation for artistic excellence, innovation, diversity, and integrity, TheatreWorks is Silicon Valley's leading professional nonprofit theatre company. TheatreWorks presents a year-round season of musicals, comedies, and dramas in the state-of-the-art Mountain View Center for the Performing Arts and at the graceful California Mission-style Lucie Stern Theatre in Palo Alto. Dedicated to the discovery and development of new voices in the American theatre, TheatreWorks regularly stages new works, many developed in the company's own New Works Initiative - frequent regional and West Coast premieres of important modern and contemporary works from Broadway, off-Broadway, and beyond - and distinctive re-imaginings of the classics. Founded by Artistic Director Robert Kelley in 1970, TheatreWorks celebrates its 40th anniversary with the 2009/10 season.
