Founded in 1992, Chicago Arts Partnerships in Education (CAPE)'s mission is to increase students' academic success, critical thinking and creativity through research-based, arts driven education.CAPE inspires students' passion for learning by weaving visual and performing arts into their classroom lessons. To bring academic subjects to life through art, CAPE partners teaching artists with Chicago Public School teachers to develop original, creative lesson plans. These lessons integrate music, dance, drama, digital art, video and photography into classrooms, and expand learning beyond school walls and into the communityÂ CAPE's unique approach to enhancing education with the arts better engages students, improves their understanding of class material, and boosts their grades. CAPE commissions rigorous, long-term research studies that show that integrating art into education continually improves students' critical thinking, self esteem, and confidence.
