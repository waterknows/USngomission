Following God's command to love our neighbor as ourselves, Nashville Rescue Mission seeks to help the hurting of Middle Tennessee by offering food, clothing and shelter to the homeless and recovery programs to those enslaved in life degrading problems. Our goal is to help people know the saving grace of Jesus, and through Him, gain wisdom for living, find fulfillment in life and become a positive part of their community. Since our founding in 1954, we have desired to provide not only meals and beds, but also support and long-term treatment for men and women with addictions and other debilitating problems.
