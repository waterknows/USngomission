We are leading the united effort to eliminate poverty by investing in our community. Our vision is a community without poverty. The United Way has been serving the Charlotte County community since 1966. For all these years, the generosity of donors has made possible programs that nurture children, help youth succeed, promote health and wellness, strengthen adults and families, and provide basic assistance to Charlotte County neighbors. The United Way draws on the resources of the entire community, both human and financial, to support programs in our area. Each of our member agencies relies on volunteers to help provide these critically needed services.
