The Literacy Assistance Center is dedicated to supporting and promoting the expansion of quality literacy services in New York. We provide services for: adult students who want to find free classes in reading, writing, and speaking English or information on getting their GED; literacy instructors who want to become more effective teachers; program managers who want to build a stronger literacy program; parents who want to help their children become better learners; policymakers who need information from the literacy field to inform their decisions; and all New Yorkers who want to participate in building a more vibrant, prosperous community. Over 800 programs across the state provide free and low-cost programs in English for speakers of other languages, adult basic education, and GED preparation.
