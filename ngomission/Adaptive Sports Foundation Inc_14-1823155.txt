The Adaptive Sports Foundation (ASF) provides profound and life changing experiences for children and adults with physical and cognitive disabilities and chronic illnesses through outdoor physical activity, education, support and community. ASF students are five years of age and older and live with disabilities ranging from relatively mild learning disabilities to more severe disabilities such as paralysis, autism, amputation, cerebral palsy and traumatic brain injury. Founded in 1984, the Foundation's work promotes physical activity for children and adults with disabilities by offering winter programs, a summer program, and competition programs (including a 12-week residential competition program for Paralympic eligible athletes).
