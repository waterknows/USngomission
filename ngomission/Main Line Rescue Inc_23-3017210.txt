Main Line Animal Rescue has helped thousands of animals find new homes while launching one of the most successful anti-puppy mill campaigns in the history of animal welfare. MLAR celebrates the special bond between companion animals and the people who love them - through rescue, adoption, education and community outreach. Every year, Main Line Animal Rescue assists hundreds of dogs, cats, and rabbits transferred to our facility from overcrowded city shelters. Many of these animals are in need of costly and immediate medical care. We also carefully screen and find new homes for animals privately surrendered by families unable to care for them any longer, and rescue and rehabilitate countless dogs from Pennsylvania's notorious puppy mills.
