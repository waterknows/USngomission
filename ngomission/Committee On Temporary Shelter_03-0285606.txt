Mission Statement: COTS provides emergency shelter, services, and housing for people who are homeless or marginally housed in Vermont. COTS advocates for long-term solutions to end homelessness. Core Values: We believe: in the value and dignity of every human life; that housing is a fundamental human right; and that emergency shelter is not the solution to homelessness. The Committee on Temporary Shelter (COTS) is the largest service provider for the homeless and those at risk of becoming homeless in Vermont. COTS is a private nonprofit, governed by a volunteer Board of Directors.The nationally recognized nonprofit operates two family shelters, an overnight shelter and a daytime shelter for single adults, and four facilities providing permanent and transitional housing. The COTS Housing Resource Center is a homelessness prevention program that helps households in financial crisis avert homelessness or move more quickly into housing.
