Founded in 1983, Eastern Illinois Foodbank exists to alleviate hunger in Eastern Illinois by providing a reliable source of food for the hungry through cooperation with a network of food pantries and agencies. We acquire, store, maintain and distribute quantities of food products and essentials to hungry people through a network of partnership agencies in a fourteen county region of eastern Illinois. We deliver over five million pounds of food product annually. This amounts to about 417,000 pounds, on the average, of food products distributed per month. The food distributed through the Foodbank reaches almost 35,000 people each month.
