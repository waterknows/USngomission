Oasis Center was founded to provide community-based care for youth experiencing alcohol and drug problems. Oasis Center has evolved over the past four decades into one of the nation's leading youth-serving organizations, offering safety and support to Nashville's most vulnerable and disconnected youth, while seeking to also teach young people how to transform the conditions that create problems for them in the first place. We believe that Nashville should be and can be a model community where all young people enter adulthood connected with positive social support systems and prepared for productive and fulfilling lives. We embrace our responsibility to change the odds in our community that will allow more young people to thrive and move into a healthy adulthood.
