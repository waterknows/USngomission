The Boy Scouts of America, Gulf Ridge Council operates in collaboration with the community to serve the youth of the West Central Florida Area by providing an environment where leadership opportunities, life-long skills, values, and morals are the outcomes for future generations. We proudly serve over 40,000 young people in West-Central Florida through the traditional programs of the Boy Scouts of America and through our character education program, Learning for Life. The council headquarters is in Tampa, Florida but we serve youth in the following eight counties: Citrus, Hardee, Hernando, Highlands, Hillsborough, Pasco, Polk and Sumter.
