The Boy Scouts of America, California Inland Empire Council has been serving youth of the Riverside and San Bernardino Counties for over 90 years. The current council was formed in 1973 through the merger of the Arrowhead Area, Grayback and Riverside Councils. In 2006, a portion of the Old Baldy Council merged into the California Inland Empire Council. The council has served hundreds of thousands of youth over the years. Its Scouts and leaders have provided innumerable hours of service to communities and individuals.
