The Humane Animal Welfare Society (HAWS) was established in 1965. HAWS assists over 6,000 animals each year and welcomes more than 31,000 human visitors annually. As an open admissions shelter, they accept animals regardless of age, health, temperament or breed. Their active humane education department offers programs and services that promote responsible pet ownership, preventing animal abuse and neglect in their community and beyond. HAWS promotes the humane care and treatment of all animals, in support of cooperative humane efforts throughout the state of Wisconsin. HAWS is a member of the Wisconsin Federated Humane Societies, and not affiliated with any other local or national humane society.
