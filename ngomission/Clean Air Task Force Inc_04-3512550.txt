The Clean Air Task Force (CATF) was launched in 1996 with a single goal: to enact federal policy to reduce the pollutants from America's coal-fired power plants that cause respiratory death and disease, smog, acid rain, and haze. CATF works to help safeguard against the worst impacts of climate change by catalyzing the rapid global development and deployment of low carbon energy and other climate-protecting technologies through research and analysis, public advocacy leadership, and partnership with the private sector.
