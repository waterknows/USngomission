Because we care about those who struggle with hunger, Second Harvest Community Food Bank is a nonprofit food distribution hub and food pantry serving 19 counties across Northwest Missouri and Northeast Kansas. We nourish our neighbors by distributing food through a network of over 100 Partner Agencies located throughout our service area and through our direct service programs. Last year we distributed over 5.7 million pounds of food.
