The YMCA of Greater Charlotte was founded in November of 1874 to help young men grow in spirit, mind and body. We are dedicated to putting Christian principles into practice through programs that build healthy spirit, mind, and body for all. The YMCA's holistic approach to wellness is designed to strengthen kids, families and communities and to emphasize the character values of honesty, caring, responsibility, respect and faith. We provide thousands of programs that build healthy spirit, mind and body in the following categories: aquatics; arts and performing arts; child care, including afterschool and day camp; resident camp; fitness and wellness; sports; and special programs and events. Our programs are designed to help you, your family and your community grow.
