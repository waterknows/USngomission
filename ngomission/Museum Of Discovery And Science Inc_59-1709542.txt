The mission of the Museum of Discovery and Science (MODS) is to provide experiential pathways to lifelong learning in science for children and adults through exhibits, programs and films. Consisting of 85,000 square feet of interior space, the 300-seat AutoNation IMAX Theater, and an open-air grand atrium, the Museum features dynamic interactive exhibits in the natural and physical sciences and a large array of programs designed to serve diverse audiences. Originally opened in 1977 as the Discovery Center, MODS serves almost 500,000 visitors each year and is the primary destination for school field trips in Broward County. Last year, the Museum served 95,000 students on school-sponsored field trips.
