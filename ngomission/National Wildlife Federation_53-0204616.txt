National Wildlife Federation's (NWF) mission is to inspire Americans to protect wildlife for our children's future. NWF gives voice to the wildlife conservation values that are part of our country's heritage. Our work focuses on three main areas. We work to find solutions to the climate crisis, keep our nation connected to nature, and safeguard America's wildlife and wild places. In all, National Wildlife Federation's work from coast to coast, community by community, helps protect, connect and restore habitat to ensure a healthy wildlife legacy for future generations.
