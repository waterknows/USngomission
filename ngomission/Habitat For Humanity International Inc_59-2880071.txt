Habitat for Humanity of Jacksonville (HabiJax) is one of the most effective Habitat for Humanity affiliates in the United States and has helped over 2,000 families realize their dream of homeownership since 1988, and we celebrate this success. HabiJax is very much a multifaceted organization with many roles: builder, community developer, underwriter, mortgage lender, social service provider, and affordable housing advocate.
