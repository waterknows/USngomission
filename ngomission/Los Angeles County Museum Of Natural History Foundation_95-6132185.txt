The mission of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County is to inspire wonder, discovery and responsibility for our natural and cultural worlds. The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County has amassed one of the world's most extensive and valuable collections of natural and cultural history - more than 35 million objects, some as old as 4.5 billion years. Its curatorial staff not only cares for those collections, but uses them for groundbreaking scientific and historic research. The Museum also curates new, immersive exhibitions that give visitors the opportunity to explore the big picture of our planet - specimens and objects, the stories behind them, and the increasing interrelatedness of the natural and cultural worlds.
