St. Mark's School, Massachusetts educates young people for lives of leadership and service. Founded in 1865 as an intentionally small residential community, the school challenges its students to develop their particular analytic and creative capabilities by both inspiring their academic and spiritual curiosity and kindling their passion for discovery. We value cooperation over self-interest, and we encourage each person to explore his or her place in the larger world beyond our campus. St. Mark's enrolls approximately 100 new students each year. In 2007-2008, we welcomed 359 students total, with 80 percent boarding and 20 percent day. The student body included 35 international students, as defined by primary residence.
