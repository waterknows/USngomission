The National Kidney Foundation of Hawaii (NKFH) is the state's leading voluntary health agency dedicated to the detection, prevention and treatment of kidney and urinary tract diseases. Founded in the 1950s, the National Kidney Foundation seeks improve the health and well-being of individuals and families affected by these diseases and increase the availability of all organs and transplants. Leading these efforts in Hawaii are more than 1,000 committed volunteers. Together, they bring help and hope to the more than 2,000 Hawaii residents who suffer from kidney failure and the many more who have kidney and urological diseases in our islands. This is accomplished through patients and community services, advocacy, public and professional education, research and organ donation programs.
