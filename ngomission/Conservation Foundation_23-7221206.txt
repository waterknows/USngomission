Established in 1972 by business and community leaders, The Conservation Foundation is a land and watershed protection organization. Our headquarters are located in Naperville, Illinois, on a 60-acre working farm, and a program office is located in Montgomery, Illinois. The mission of the Foundation is to preserve open space and natural lands, protect rivers and watersheds, and promote stewardship of our environment. The Foundation maintains a support base of over 4,500 members and donors, and 500 volunteers in DuPage, Kane, Kendall and Will Counties, Illinois. Although we work throughout Northeastern Illinois, these are the counties in which we focus our efforts.
