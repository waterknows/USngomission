Tri-City Union Gospel Mission began serving Benton and Franklin counties over 57 years ago, providing rescue ministry to the broken, bruised, and needy in the Tri-Cities and surrounding communities. Our desire is still the same today-to minister to the spiritual, physical, and moral needs of transient and destitute individuals and assist the poor and needy. We serve as advocates for the homeless, poor and discarded members of our community, with an emphasis on presenting a realistic and compassionate picture of their unique needs, especially homeless women and children. We believe the gospel of Jesus Christ can positively impact the lives of these men and women for lasting change.
