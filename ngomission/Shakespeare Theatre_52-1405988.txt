Since its founding in 1985, the Shakespeare Theatre Company has endeavored to be the nation's leading force in the presentation and preservation of classic theatre. Our core mission is to present classic theatre in an accessible, skillful, imaginative, American style that honors playwrights' language and intentions while viewing their plays through a 21st-century lens. With the formation of the Harman Center for the Arts - which includes the new Sidney Harman Hall and the existing Lansburgh Theatre - the Shakespeare Theatre Company is a national destination theatre offering a broad range of works to audiences in the greater-Washington area and across the nation.
