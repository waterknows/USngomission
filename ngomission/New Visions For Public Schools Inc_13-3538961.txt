New Visions for Public Schools, founded in 1989, is the largest education reform organization dedicated to improving the quality of education children receive in New York City's public schools. Working with the public and private sectors, New Visions develops programs and policies to energize teaching and learning and to raise the level of student achievement. Our goal is to ensure that all students have access to effective schools that enable them to realize their full potential and become productive citizens. New Visions provides incentives and supports to teachers to explore and implement new ways to engage students and increase the relevancy and rigor of classroom practices.
