Founded in 1985, endPoverty.org helps enable the very poor of the world to lift themselves, their families and their communities out of poverty. We provide small loans, business training and community development programs through a network of locally-led organizations in twelve countries to equip poor families to improve their lives. After more than two decades of work across the developing world, endPoverty.org understands that poor people in every country have skills and initiative that they want to use to lift their families out of poverty. Instead of a handout in the form of aid, many thousands of poor clients have received a hand up through training and small business loans.
