The Iditarod Trail Committee works to promote and preserve the historic Iditarod Trail, most notably through the annual staging of a sled dog race from Anchorage to Nome, Alaska. The Iditarod Trail, now a National Historic Trail, had its beginnings as a mail and supply route, and later became a life saving highway for epidemic-stricken Nome. The Iditarod covers over 1,150 miles of terrain, and the Sled Dog Race has been called the "Last Great Race on Earth," winning worldwide acclaim and interest. The race pits man and animal against nature, against wild Alaska at her best and as each mile is covered, a tribute to Alaska's past is issued. The Iditarod is a tie to - a commemoration of - that colorful past.
