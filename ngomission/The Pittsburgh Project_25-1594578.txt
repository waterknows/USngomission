The Pittsburgh Project is a community development organization with a 23-year track record of developing leaders and serving the city's most vulnerable residents. We operate a progressive series of after school programs for urban young people, deploy over 2,500 people annually to perform free home repairs for Pittsburgh's in-need elderly homeowners, outfit college students for urban service and leadership, and spearhead economic development and anti-violence efforts in our Pittsburgh neighborhood.
