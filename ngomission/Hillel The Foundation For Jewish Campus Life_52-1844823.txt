Hillel's mission is to enrich the lives of Jewish students so that they may enrich the Jewish people and the world.As the largest Jewish student organization in the world, Hillel engages with more Jewish college students than all other endeavors combined. On more than 550 colleges and universities, Hillel welcomes students of all backgrounds and fosters an enduring commitment to Jewish life, learning and Israel. Hillel builds connections with emerging adults and inspires them to direct their own path. By participating in life-changing trips and campus initiatives, students learn to make a meaningful impact on the future of the Jewish people and the world while they grow intellectually, socially, and spiritually. During their formative college years, students are challenged to explore, experience, and create vibrant Jewish lives. At the heart of the Hillel network is the Charles and Lynn Schusterman International Center, supporting local Hillels to ensure that we achieve our mission.
