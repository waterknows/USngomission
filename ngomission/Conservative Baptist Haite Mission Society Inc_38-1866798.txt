Founded in 1964, the Baptist Haiti Mission operates in the country of Haiti. The Mission's educational influence remains strong through building schools, sponsoring children, and training teachers. Agriculture, carpentry, mechanic work and construction are done at the Mission providing jobs for many Haitians to support their families. The hospital on the Mission property cooperates with the Department of Health and offers a range of preventative care and treatment throughout the mountain area. These ministries meet many humanitarian needs, but apart from a living and active relationship with Jesus Christ, they are incomplete. The Baptist Haiti Mission seeks to make disciples and to see the power of Jesus Christ change the country of Haiti.
