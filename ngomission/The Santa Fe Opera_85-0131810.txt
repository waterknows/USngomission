The Santa Fe Opera's mission is to present productions meeting the highest artistic standards in a repertory of new, rarely performed, and standard works. Founded in 1957, the Opera has taken its place among the world's leading opera festivals and has become one of New Mexico's cultural and economic leaders. More than half the audience of 85,000 comes from outside New Mexico representing every state in the union as well as 25 to 30 foreign countries. More than 1,600 performances of nearly 140 different operas have been given at the Opera, including nine world premieres and more than 40 American premieres. The Santa Fe Opera has a wide array of education and community outreach programs to make opera accessible and appealing to a broad spectrum of the New Mexico population.
