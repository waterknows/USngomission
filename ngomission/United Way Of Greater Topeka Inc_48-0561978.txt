For more than 80 years, United Way of Greater Topeka has been improving and changing lives. It began during the Great Depression when a local Community Chest was founded to bring hope and prosperity to the community. Through recessions and depressions, in times of peace and war, and during local disasters, United Way and its partners stepped in and rose to the challenge. The United Way of Greater Topeka creates positive sustainable change in our community.
