Founded in 1998, Interfaith Alliance celebrates religious freedom by championing individual rights, promoting policies that protect both religion and democracy, and uniting diverse voices to challenge extremism. Interfaith Alliance is the only national interfaith organization dedicated to protecting the integrity of both religion and democracy in America. We stand for faith and freedom. We promote legislation that protects the boundaries between religion and government, so that politics doesn't infringe on your faith and matters of faith don't infringe on your freedom. Our local affiliates mobilize individuals on the grass-roots level to make a difference in their own communities. We offer a forum to challenge bigotry and defend religious freedom on local issues, including candidate education, religion in the public sphere, and interfaith relations. We help religious leaders and politicians navigate the boundary between politics and religion in a way that safeguards the separation of church and state. We facilitate interfaith dialogue to enhance mutual understanding and respect for religious differences.
