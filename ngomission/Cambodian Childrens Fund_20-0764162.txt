Cambodian Children's Fund transforms the country's most impoverished kids into tomorrow's leaders, by delivering education, family support and community development programs into the heart of Cambodia's most impoverished communities.We believe that with the right education and support, one child has the potential to lift an entire family out of poverty and that a generation of educated children has the power to change a whole society. Through intensive, long-term investments in children, CCF is helping students build the skills, confidence and integrity they need to become the progressive spokespeople and leaders of change in their community.Through our 6 core program areas - Education, Leadership, Community Outreach, Healthcare, Childcare and Vocational Training - we take a holistic, on-the-ground approach to developing integrated yet simple solutions to the complex issues of poverty.
