United Way is working to advance the common good. Our mission is centered on tackling our community's key issues and working towards solutions around our four focus areas: Education, Income, Health and Safety Net Services. We accomplish our work by raising and distributing funds to support a vital network of health and human services through agency partner programs and our initiatives. Each year, United Way programs help close to 100,000 local people through a broad range of programs, including youth development, helping families become more financially independent, improving people's health and helping those in crisis. Our goal is to create lasting community change, and by working with our partners, donors and volunteers we improve lives and build a stronger community for all of us.
