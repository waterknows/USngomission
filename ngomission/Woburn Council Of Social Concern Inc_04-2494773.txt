Founded in 1969, the Council of Social Concern is a charitable, community-based agency responding to the basic needs of people of all ages, providing early childhood education and care, helping individuals develop their potential, creating positive family and community relationships, and fostering respect for diversity. We envision a viable agency providing quality services that meet basic and changing community needs in-line with our mission.
