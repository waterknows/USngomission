Founded in 1928, The Kalamazoo Civic Theatre strives to produce a diverse spectrum of theatre of the highest quality and to provide hands-on learning experiences in all aspects of theatre production and management. As Kalamazoo's community theatre, we are dedicated to serving the needs of southwest Michigan. Additionally, we act as a training ground for many young performers and designers, launching many successful careers.
