Founded in 1952, the American Council on Germany (ACG) is an independent, nonpartisan organization which promotes dialogue among leaders from business, government, and the media in the United States and Europe. The ACG strengthens transatlantic understanding and coordinates policy initiatives on key issues in the post-September 11 world. Through its range of programs and outreach activities, the ACG anticipates emerging challenges relevant to the transatlantic relationship and encourages innovative approaches to problem solving. ACG convenes regular policy discussions, identifies future leaders, organizes high-level conferences and workshops, awards fellowships to American and German professionals, and publishes occasional papers on a range of transatlantic issues.
