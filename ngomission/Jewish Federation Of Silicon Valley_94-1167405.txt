The mission of the Jewish Federation of Silicon Valley is to raise and to allocate funds needed to maintain and strengthen Jewish identity, Jewish community and Jewish life, and to work toward meeting the needs and concerns of the Jewish community locally, in the United States, in Israel and throughout the Diaspora and to develop leadership. In fulfilling its purposes and programs, the Federation embodies a primary commitment to Klal Yisrael (the responsibility of each Jew for another), to Tikun Olam (the process of repairing the world), and to the centrality of Israel to the Jewish people.
