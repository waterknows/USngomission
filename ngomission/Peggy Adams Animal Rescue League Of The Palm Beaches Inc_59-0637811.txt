Peggy Adams Animal Rescue League (the Humane Society of the Palm Beaches) provides services to over 25,000 cats, dogs, puppies and kittens each year. Since 1925, we've been saving lives, improving animal welfare and addressing overpopulation in Palm Beach County. Our vision is to create a community where 100% of the adoptable animals find loving homes and no animals will be euthanized because of pet overpopulation. Peggy Adams Animal Rescue League relies solely on the generosity of individuals, foundations and corporations. Your donations directly support our efforts to help animals in need. Our mission is to provide shelter to lost, homeless and unwanted animals; to furnish medical and other services for the care of companion animals; to care for, protect, and find quality homes for homeless and neglected animals; to advocate animal welfare, community involvement and education to further the bond between people and animals, for the mutual benefit of both.
