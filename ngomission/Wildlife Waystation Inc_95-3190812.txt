Wildlife Waystation's mission is to provide healing, refuge and education. It has rescued and accepted wild and exotic animals across the United States as well as tigers from Ireland and lions from New Zealand and Canada.  Thousands of native wildlife have been rehabilitated and successfully released back into the wild. Thousands more, including many exotics, have remained as permanent residents. With a diverse population, each species receives specialized care from its animal care staff, full-time veterinarians and dedicated volunteers. Wildlife Waystation is the largest chimpanzee sanctuary in the Western United States. Most have come from research facilities.Education is a priority with a goal to preserve native wildlife through understanding how to co-exist and why exotic animals may not make good pets. Volunteers speak to civic groups, scouts and schools. Educational efforts also include participation in community events throughout Southern California.
