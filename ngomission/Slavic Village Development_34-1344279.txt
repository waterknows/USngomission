Slavic Village Development (SVD) will promote, empower, and build Broadway Slavic Village as a thriving diverse community. Broadway Slavic Village is a vibrant, connected and diverse community where all can live sustainably and well and whose neighborhoods are organized around active living where residents and visitors can walk and bike to work, shopping, arts, and worship. The goal of the organization is to revitalize the Broadway neighborhood through rehabilitation of existing housing, storefronts and buildings; construction of new homes; retention of existing buildings and recruitment of new ones; and provision of housing services and community organizing programs to improve the quality of life.
