Mid-America is located in Dyer, Indiana just 30 minutes south of beautiful downtown Chicago. Mid-America's primary focus is preparing students for the pastoral ministry, but the seminary is also committed to providing solid theological training to others whose life calling may be enhanced by a theological education. Our curriculum is designed to equip students to humbly open and apply God's Word in contemporary culture while ensuring they have ample opportunity to cultivate their gifts for ministry. The Seminary offers courses in biblical, theological, ecclesiastical and ministerial disciplines.
