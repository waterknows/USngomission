Founded by Ciar√°n O'Reilly and Charlotte Moore, The Irish Repertory Theatre (IRT) opened its doors in September 1988. The mission of the theatre is to: bring works by Irish and Irish American masters and contemporary playwrights to American audiences; provide a context for understanding the contemporary Irish American experience; and to encourage the development of new works focusing on the Irish and Irish American experience, as well as a range of other cultures. In 1995, IRT made its permanent home in Chelsea, allowing for both a Main Stage theatre and a smaller studio space, the W. Scott McLucas Studio. The IRT is currently the only year-round theatre company in New York City devoted to bringing Irish and Irish American works to the stage.
