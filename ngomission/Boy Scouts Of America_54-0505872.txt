The mission of the Boy Scouts of America is to prepare young people to make ethical choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Law. In 1913, the Heart of Virginia Council was chartered by John Stewart Bryan and D. W. Durrett, who served as first Council President and Council Commissioner, respectively. We provide character building, citizenship and personal fitness training for youth of all ages.
