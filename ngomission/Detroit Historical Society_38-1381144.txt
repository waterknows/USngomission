Since its founding in 1921, the Detroit Historical Society (DHS) has been dedicated to ensuring that the history of the region is preserved so that current and future generations of Detroiters can better understand the people, places and events that helped shape our lives. The DHS educates and inspires our community and visitors by preserving and portraying our region's shared history through dynamic exhibits and experiences; its vision is to create a shared sense of community and pride by celebrating the history and unique culture of our region. The Society is the day-to-day manager of the Detroit Historical Museum, the Dossin Great Lakes Museum and the more than 200,000 artifacts held in the collections.
