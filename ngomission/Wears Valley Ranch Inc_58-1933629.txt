The year-round ministry of Wears Valley Ranch is to help children from crisis family situations. Our goal is to meet the spiritual, emotional, physical, and educational needs of children who, for various reasons, need a stronger family support system. Each program is designed to address one or more of these specific needs, but all of the programs operate with a common goal -- to see each person inspired to follow Christ, healed from the past, and equipped to reach his or her full potential.
