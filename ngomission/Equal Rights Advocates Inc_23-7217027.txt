Equal Rights Advocates (ERA) has led the legal fight for women's equality since 1974. We have worked to protect and secure equal rights and economic opportunities for women and girls through litigation and advocacy. We work to eradicate illegal discriminatory practices that deny women advancement opportunities, equal compensation, and access to certain occupations. ERA demands that employers provide women with a work environment that is free of sexual harassment and in compliance with health and safety laws. We enforce family and medical leave and pregnancy protection laws, and is active in the effort to establish paid family and medical leave.
