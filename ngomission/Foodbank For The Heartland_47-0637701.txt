Food Bank for the Heartland, formed in 1981, works to alleviate hunger through the collection of donated food and household products and the distribution of these items to charities and organizations that help people in need. The Food Bank works with over 325 organizations in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa to combat the issue of hunger. We distribute approximately 15 million pounds of food annually. Food distributed through the Food Bank helped over 155,000 people in need this past year.
