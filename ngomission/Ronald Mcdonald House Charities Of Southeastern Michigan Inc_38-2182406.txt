Believing that every child deserves a safe and supportive place to grow, Ronald McDonald House Charities of Southeastern Michigan creates, finds and supports programs that directly improve the health and well being of children. We fulfill our mission by providing a home-away-from-home for families of seriously ill children, managing programs that help deliver health services to children in under-served communities, and by providing grants to nonprofit organizations for programs that enable seriously ill children to live happier, healthier lives.
