Founded in 1981, Human Options provides a safe haven and life changing programs to help abused women, their children and families rebuild their lives. Women and children receive shelter, food, counseling, legal advocacy and linkage to resources in the community that works to break the cycle of domestic violence at every stage. Through research, education and the art of listening, Human Options has grown and continues to grow. We listen to our clients to find out exactly what they need to become free from domestic violence. With this information and our comprehensive research, we continue to develop and strengthen our programs.
