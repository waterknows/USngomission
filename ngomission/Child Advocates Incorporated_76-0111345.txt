Founded in 1984, Child Advocates mobilizes court appointed volunteers to break the vicious cycle of child abuse. We speak up for abused children who are lost in the system and guide them into safe environments where they can thrive. Volunteers are assigned to the cases of children who have been victims of life-threatening abuse or neglect and, as a result, have been placed in protective custody. They contact caseworkers, interview parents, ensure necessary medical care, look out for educational interests and make recommendations in court regarding the permanent placement of the child. Most importantly, they serve as a constant person for that child to count on during a very tumultuous time. Essentially, our volunteers do whatever it takes to ensure that the needs of the child are being met while that child is in care.
