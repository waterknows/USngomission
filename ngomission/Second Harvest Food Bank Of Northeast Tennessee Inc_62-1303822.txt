Founded in May 1986, Second Harvest Food Bank of Northeast Tennessee serves the eight counties in northeast Tennessee with emergency food for distribution. We secure food from national manufacturers, grocers, and individuals and redistribute it to over 200 food pantries, soup kitchens, children's homes, and other non-profit charities that feed the hungry in the area. Our Mission is to feed the hungry by securing and distributing food and grocery products to regional agencies that provide services to the needy, ill, children and elderly in Northeast Tennessee.
