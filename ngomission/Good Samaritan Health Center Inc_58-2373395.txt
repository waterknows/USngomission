The Good Samaritan Health Center was formed in 1998 and opened for service in 1999. The Center provides a comprehensive range of services for patients without the means to afford care. Atlanta's homeless make up about 20% of patient visits, the working poor 70%, and those who are Medicaid/Medicare eligible compose 10% of our visits. The Center's vision is to create a dependable, full-time, comprehensive healthcare system for Atlanta's working poor and homeless. We offer an ongoing relationship with a network of dedicated healthcare specialists who address each need. Most importantly, The Center provides a comfortable environment for our patients, where all people are treated with dignity and respect.
