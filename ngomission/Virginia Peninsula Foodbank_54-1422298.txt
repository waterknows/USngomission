Founded in 1986, the Virginia Peninsula Foodbank distributes food effectively through collaborative efforts that minimize hunger, promote nutrition and encourage self-reliance through education. The Foodbank is the leading non-profit hunger-relief organization on the Virginia Peninsula which receives and distributes purchased and donated food. In turn, these items are distributed to qualified nonprofit organizations providing food to the less fortunate across the Greater Peninsula. For the fiscal year ending June 30,2015, the Foodbank distributed over 11 million pounds of food throughout its service area which encompasses the cities of Hampton, Newport News, Poquoson and Williamsburg and the counties of Gloucester, James City, Mathews, Surry and York.
