Founded in 1964, the mission of the National Tropical Botanical Garden (NTBG) is to enrich life through discovery, scientific research, conservation, and education by perpetuating the survival of plants, ecosystems, and cultural knowledge of tropical regions. Our mission is achieved through a network of diverse gardens and preserves in Hawai'i and Florida; conservation, research, and reference collections (living, library, and herbarium); research in botany, ethnobotany, horticulture, conservation biology, and restoration ecology through programs and institutes; educational courses, publications, lectures, and visitor programs; and the facilities and infrastructure necessary to conduct this work.
