Founded in 2000, Children of Armenia Fund (COAF) works to secure a future for children in Armenia's impoverished rural villages through improved education, health care, community life and economic conditions. At their core, our programs create and sustain opportunities for growth and progress. COAF launched its own ground operations in 2004, expanding to a cluster of 6 villages by 2006. Over the course of our history, our model has expanded and evolved to meet the needs of more than 22,000 individuals.
