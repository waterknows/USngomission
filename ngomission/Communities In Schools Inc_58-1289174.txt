For more than 30 years, Communities In Schools has been helping students achieve in school, graduate and go on to bright futures. Our mission is to surround students with a community of support, empowering them to stay in school and achieve in life. We believe that it's relationships--not programs--that change children, and so our organization focuses on the power of a caring and connected adult. Our unique model positions site coordinators inside schools to assess students' needs and provide resources to help them succeed in the classroom and in life. We partner with local businesses, social service agencies, health care providers and volunteers. Whether it's food, school supplies, health care, counseling, academic assistance or a positive role model, Communities In Schools is there to help.
