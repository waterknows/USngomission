Twin Cities Habitat for Humanity brings people together to create and preserve homeownership in our neighborhoods, and to partner with hard-working, low-income families to be successful homeowners. We're best known for our homeownership program that builds and rehabs simple, quality homes in partnership with low-income families and the community. We sell the homes with affordable, zero percent interest mortgages, making a 30-year commitment to each new homeowner and to the community in which they live. We also preserve homeownership by helping low-income homeowners repair and maintain their homes through our A Brush with Kindness program and by assisting families living in the City of Minneapolis who are facing foreclosure or who have fallen behind in their mortgage payments through our Mortgage Foreclosure Prevention program.
