Providence Place (formerly Methodist Mission Home) was founded in 1895 in the wake of a dramatic and spontaneous conversion experience by Madam M. L. Volino who ran a brothel on San Saba Street. Inspired by a street revivalist, Madam Volino returned to her house in the red light district vowing to begin a new life. Providence Place offers hope to individuals facing spiritually, emotionally and physically challenging circumstances, so they may lead enriched, rewarding and satisfying lives. Through professional guidance and compassionate support, teens and young women facing unplanned pregnancy and families considering adoption make mutually beneficial decisions. Through transitional education, including life skills and vocational training, young adults with disabilities and those who are deaf develop confidence and competence to reach their personal level of independent living.
