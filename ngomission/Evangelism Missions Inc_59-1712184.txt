Evangelism Missions Inc. (EMI) is a fundamental Baptist missions ministry. EMI's purpose is to win souls, establish churches, and train preachers for those indigenous churches. EMI missionaries come from fundamental Baptist churches and must maintain membership in a local Baptist church. EMI assists the local church in getting their missionaries to the field. Support for those missionaries comes from churches, businesses, and individuals. We exist for the purpose of assisting the local Independent Baptist Church in carrying the message of salvation through the free grace of Jesus Christ.
