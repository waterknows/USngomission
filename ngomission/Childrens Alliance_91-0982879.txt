Children's Alliance works to improve the well being of children by effecting positive changes in public policies, priorities, and programs. Our vision is that all of Washington's children will have what they need to grow up to be the people they dream of becoming. At the Children's Alliance, we're advocates for kids. We ensure that laws, policies and programs work for kids, and we hold our leaders accountable until they secure the resources required to make all children safe and healthy.
