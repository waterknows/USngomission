Oasis is dedicated to assisting impoverished families who strive to achieve economic independence by providing educational programs to equip women and children with the skills they need to become self-sufficient. We provide a hand up, not a hand out by offering adult education classes for women and educational enrichment programs for at-risk youth in the community, completely free of charge. All programs are designed to help these families succeed in the workplace and in the public education system. In the short twelve years since opening our doors, Oasis has grown from a soup kitchen serving meals to women and children to a safe haven where women living in extreme poverty are welcomed with open arms and encouraged to advance their education with the goal of becoming self-sufficient.
