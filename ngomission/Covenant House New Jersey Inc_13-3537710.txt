Covenant House New Jersey (CHNJ) was founded and incorporated in 1989. CHNJ is the largest provider in the state of services to homeless and at-risk adolescents under the age of 22. In addition to food, shelter, clothing, and crisis care, CHNJ provides health care, educational and vocational services, counseling, drug abuse treatment and prevention programs, legal services, mother/child programs, transitional living programs, street outreach, and aftercare. Last year, we served over 2,000 young people. Tonight alone, we will give 110 homeless adolescents and 19 babies in North and South Jersey a safe and caring place to sleep. Our Crisis Centers provide our kids with a safe haven to live while they stabilize their crises and work on a plan to transition to a stable living environment where they can continue to progress in their life goals.
