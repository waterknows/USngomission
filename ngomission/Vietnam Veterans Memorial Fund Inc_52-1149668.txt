As the founders of The Wall, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund works to preserve the legacy of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, to promote healing and to educate about the impact of the Vietnam War. The Vietnam Veterans Memorial was initially conceived with one overriding purpose -- to bring long overdue honor and recognition to the men and women who served and sacrificed their lives in Vietnam. Today, the Memorial has transcended its role as a national symbol of reconciliation and stands as a living history lesson. The Memorial is unique in its ability to inspire exploration and reflection about this critical time in our nation's past, with a wiser eye toward the future. More than 400,000 items have been left at The Wall by visitors since its dedication in 1982.
