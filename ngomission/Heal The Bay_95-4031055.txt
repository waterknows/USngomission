Since 1985, Heal the Bay has been dedicated to making Southern California coastal waters and watersheds, including Santa Monica Bay, safe, healthy and clean. We use research, education, community action and advocacy to pursue our mission. Since our inception, Heal the Bay has made substantial progress in protecting California's aquatic habitats. Heal the Bay continues to strive to make California coastal waters safe and healthy for people and marine life by continually improving its educational programs, advocating for protective legislative measures and encouraging people to take an active role in environmental protection. Our programs include the Beach Report Card, Los Angeles County Coastal Cleanup Day, operating the Santa Monica Pier Aquarium, and various educational programs.
