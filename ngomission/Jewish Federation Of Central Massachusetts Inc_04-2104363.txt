Jewish Federation of Central Massachusetts aims to protect and enhance the well-being of Jews in our community and worldwide. We work to lead, build and strengthen and renew a dynamic local Jewish community as well as represent its interests and concerns. We ensure that members of the local Jewish community facing difficult times, crisis or hardship can turn to us for help. We support, strengthen and build a vibrant Jewish community through a wide range of cultural and educational offerings. We extend our help to the most vulnerable Jews in Israel and the Former Soviet Union, while actively supporting the Jewish homeland.
