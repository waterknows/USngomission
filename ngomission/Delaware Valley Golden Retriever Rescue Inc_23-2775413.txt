The mission of Delaware Valley Golden Retriever Rescue (DVGRR) is to respond to unwanted, abused, neglected or puppy mill survivor golden retrievers and to provide veterinary care and rehabilitation until a suitable adoptive home is found through a stringent application process. DVGRR provides education relating to the breed as well as education to the general public about responsible dog ownership. Since 1993, Delaware Valley Golden Retriever Rescue has successfully placed over 3,200 Golden Retrievers into new homes throughout Eastern Pennsylvania, Delaware and New Jersey.
