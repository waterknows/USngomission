The Road Home, formerly Travelers Aid Society, is a social service agency established in 1923 in Utah to assist stranded travelers, unescorted and runaway youth, and other disconnected persons. Today, the Road Home provides support and shelter for overcoming homelessness. We have a wide variety of programs that provide services to people. The Road Home operates out of The Salt Lake Community Shelter, the largest homeless shelter in Utah. We begin by providing people with basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter, while immediately working with them to develop a plan for housing. Our programs are designed to connect people with resources and help integrate them back into the community.
