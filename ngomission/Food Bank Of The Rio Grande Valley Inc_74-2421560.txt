The Food Bank of the Rio Grande Valley, Inc. was founded in 1983 by Rev. Ted and Martha Knies in Pharr, TX. The Valley had just been hit with a devastating freeze and Rev. and Mrs. Knies wanted to help the families affected by this event. Today, the Food Bank RGV has grown to become the 36th largest food bank in terms of distribution in the nation and the 5th largest in the state of Texas. We currently serve the counties of Starr, Hidalgo, Cameron, and Willacy.
