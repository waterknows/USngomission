The Boy Scouts of America goal is to train youth in responsible citizenship, character development, and self-reliance through participation in a wide range of outdoor activities, educational programs, and, at older age levels, career-oriented programs in partnership with community organizations. For younger members, the Scout method is part of the program to inculcate typical Scouting values such as trustworthiness, good citizenship, and outdoors skills, through a variety of activities such as camping, aquatics, and hiking. The Indian Nations Council, originally called the Tulsa Council, was first chartered in 1911 and has a rich heritage of building leadership skills in youth. Today the Council serves more than 21,000 youth and over 4,000 adult volunteers throughout 18 counties in eastern Oklahoma. Over the past century the Council has positively impacted hundreds of thousands of Scouts and their families.
