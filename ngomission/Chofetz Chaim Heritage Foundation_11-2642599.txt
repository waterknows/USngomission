Since 1989, the Chofetz Chaim Heritage Foundation has successfully launched innovative methods of promoting the Torah's wisdom on human relations and personal development. The Foundation utilizes a vast array of effective communication tools including books, tapes, video seminars, telephone classes and a newsletter, designed to heighten one's awareness of such essential values as judging others favorably, speaking with restraint and integrity, and acting with sensitivity and respect. The Chofetz Chaim Heritage Foundation's programs, which reach over 100,000 adults and children annually, reassert the Torah's timeless recipe for building a world of compassion and harmony.
