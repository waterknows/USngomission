The Stamford Center for the Arts (SCA) is Connecticut's regional arts center for exciting entertainment that enhances and enriches the cultural, economic and social life of the community. SCA stages a series of live theatrical productions throughout the season to encourage, promote and foster a broad variety of cultural, educational, and entertainment events for the regional community. Last season alone, SCA hosted more than 500 events, of which we presented 200 stage performances, and attracted more than 250,000 patrons to downtown Stamford. SCA's outreach program involves people of different ages and socioeconomic backgrounds in cultural programs, providing opportunities to experience first hand the excitement of the performing arts by attending productions and jazz camp.
