A Christian non-profit, Feed My Starving Children (FMSC) has tackled world hunger since 1987 by sending volunteer-packed, nutritious meals to 70 countries. These meals are specifically designed to reverse and prevent malnutrition and are used in schools, orphanages, clinics and feeding programs to break the cycle of poverty. In 2015, FMSC welcomed more than 1 million volunteers to pack nearly 273 million meals through its permanent sites and nationwide MobilePack program. The Minnesota-based charity spends 92% of total donations directly on feeding the hungry and has earned the highest 4-star rating from Charity Navigator for 11 consecutive years.
