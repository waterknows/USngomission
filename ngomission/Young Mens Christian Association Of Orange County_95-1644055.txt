The YMCA of Orange County brings a sense of belonging to the community. We promote strong basic values and feelings of high self-worth that are critical for people of all ages. The YMCA's commitment to meeting community needs is continually demonstrated in programs ranging from child care, after-school enrichment, youth leadership and development, mentoring and tutoring, youth and adult sports, fitness, camping, and family support activities. The YMCA has been offering services to the residents of Orange County since the first YMCA in Santa Ana was founded in the 1880's. Today the YMCA of Orange County has eight branches, serves 85,000 residents of Orange County annually, is the largest provider of licensed school-age child care in the county, and has program offerings in 100+ locations spanning the county.
