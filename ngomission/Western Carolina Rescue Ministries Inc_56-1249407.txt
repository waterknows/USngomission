Western Carolina Rescue Ministries has served our community faithfully since March of 1981. Over thirty years, we have seen God move mightily in the lives of the men and women we serve. Some women and men come in for food and shelter, while others benefit from out one-year residential recovery program which offers freedom from the chains of addiction. People are at the heart of our mission, and they need God's love. Our mission is to Provide Rescue, Recovery and Restoration in Jesus' Name. Each of the three components of our Ministry, Rescue, Recovery and Restoration, is about meeting people in crisis where they are, caring for them with dignity and restoring them to healthy, productive lives.
