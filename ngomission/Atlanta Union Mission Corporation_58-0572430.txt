Atlanta Mission (formally Atlanta Union Mission) was established in 1938 as a refuge for homeless and hungry individuals displaced by the Great Depression. Over the years, the Mission has grown from a single shelter in downtown Atlanta to six facilities, which provide emergency food and shelter, residential recovery programs and transitional housing. Atlanta Union Mission is a Christian ministry that brings Christ's healing power to any person in crisis through programs of rescue and recovery. The Mission serves as many as 1,070 men, women and children every day of the year.
