The Epilepsy Foundation leads the fight to stop seizures, find a cure and overcome the challenges created by epilepsy. Established in 1983, the Epilepsy Foundation Texas-Houston/Dallas-Fort Worth/West Texas is a group of dedicated staff members and volunteers working to improve the lives of people with epilepsy and those who care for them. As an affiliate of the national office of the Epilepsy Foundation, our organization serves 176 of the 254 counties in Texas. Our programs and services empower people with epilepsy to live productive lives by providing information and guidance on epilepsy self-management and promoting awareness of the condition among professionals and the public.
