AIDS Emergency Fund (AEF) responds compassionately to the AIDS crisis by providing immediate, short-term financial assistance to help people disabled by HIV/AIDS to cover their basic human needs and stabilize their living situations. Short-term financial assistance from AEF is a key element of San Francisco's continuum of care, and AEF collaborates with other service providers to insure that clients access all available resources and assistance. Through compassionate intervention by AEF, people living with HIV/AIDS can maintain access to medical care and drug therapies, avoid eviction and homelessness, and live with greater stability and dignity during their illness. Since 1982, AEF has provided more than $30,000,000 in emergency financial assistance.
