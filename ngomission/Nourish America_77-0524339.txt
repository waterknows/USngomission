Nourish America is committed to providing the daily essential nutrition that impoverished American children, families, pregnant moms, and seniors and others in need require to live productive, successful lives. We do this by providing them nutrient rich foods and products such as vitamin supplements and nourishing foods (including naturals and organics). Our distribution network includes thousands of volunteers and staff who work at hundreds of Nourish America partner organizations and agencies serving those in need across all 50 states. Nourish America partners with many community and faith-based organizations.
