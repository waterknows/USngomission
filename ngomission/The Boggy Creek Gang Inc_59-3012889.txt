Founded in 1996, Camp Boggy Creek is a year-round medical camp for children with serious illnesses. Co-founded by actor/philanthropist Paul Newman and General H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the camp offers week-long summer sessions and family retreat weekends at no charge to the children or families. Located in Eustis, Florida, the 232-acre nonprofit serves children ages 7-16 that have been diagnosed with chronic or life-threatening conditions. The camp is entirely funded by generous donations from individuals, corporations, foundations and healthcare partners. Camp Boggy Creek is a proud member of SeriousFun Children's Network.
