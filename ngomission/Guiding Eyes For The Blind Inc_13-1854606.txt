Guiding Eyes for the Blind is dedicated to enriching the lives of blind and visually impaired men and women by providing them with the freedom to travel safely, thereby assuring greater independence, dignity and new horizons of opportunity. Guiding Eyes breeds, raises, and trains guide dogs and trains students to work with guide dogs that have been carefully selected to match their individual needs. Our training programs and life-long follow-up support are completely free of charge. Besides having an outstanding staff of instructors and an internationally admired corps of guide dogs, Guiding Eyes prides itself on small class size (average 12 students per class) allowing for plenty of individual attention, and a casual, friendly, home-like atmosphere throughout the school.
