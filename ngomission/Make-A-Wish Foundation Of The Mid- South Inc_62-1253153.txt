Make-A-Wish Foundation of the Mid-South grants the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions to enrich the human experience with hope, strength, and joy. Fulfilling a child's wish provides a joyful and meaningful experience that benefits both the child and the family. The Make-A-Wish Foundation of the Mid-South was founded in 1986. Since that time, the Mid-South chapter and its supporters have made dreams come true for more than 4,500 children.
