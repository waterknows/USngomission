CTN is an effective and dependable transportation alternative in Fort Wayne and Allen County. Whether seniors needing alternatives, a preschool with transportation needs, a club or a group going to an event, an organization needing help for clients to access programs, or someone with limited mobility needing extra passenger assistance, we offer help. Our vision is that fewer transportation barriers will exist and full access to community life will be available for seniors, persons with disabilities, low income families, children and youth.
