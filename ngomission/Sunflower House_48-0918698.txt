Founded in 1977, Sunflower House is a non-residential child advocacy and abuse center serving Wyandotte and Johnson Counties in Kansas. Our mission is to protect children in our community from physical and sexual abuse through education, advocacy, forensic and medical services. Sunflower House addresses abuse and neglect through a comprehensive approach that engages children, parents, child-serving professionals and the community. It is a place for children to be interviewed after a report of child abuse has been made. Sunflower House works with the police and child protective service social workers to talk with children in our safe and child-centered location.
