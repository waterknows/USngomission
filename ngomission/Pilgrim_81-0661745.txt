Pilgrim Africa was founded in 2001 as an indigenous Christian response to the plight of more than 1.5 million refugees living in IDP camps in the war torn regions of Northern Uganda. Today, Pilgrim has grown to be an international organization with catalytic regional and national interventions in public health and education. Pilgrim works to challenge despair, love boldly, and help African people create a future of sustainable prosperity and health.
