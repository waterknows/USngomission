Wave Hill is a 28-acre public garden and cultural center in the Bronx overlooking the Hudson River and Palisades. Its mission is to celebrate the artistry and legacy of its gardens and landscapes, to preserve its magnificent views, and to explore human connections to the natural world through programs in horticulture, education and the arts. Wave Hill's magnificent gardens and vistas provide a place of peace in the urban landscape and inform a wealth of educational and cultural programs. Our city's children and their teachers gain new science skills and a deeper understanding of the environment through school partnerships and summer programs for teens. Garden tours and workshops, art exhibitions and public programs like the Family Art Project, concerts, and Barefoot Dancing on summer evenings empower children and adults alike to expand their horizons in an exceptional setting.
