The mission of the Make-A-Wish FoundationÂ® of South Dakota is to grant wishes for children with life-threatening medical conditions to enrich the human experience with hope, strength and joy. Our chapter grants wishes of each referred and eligible child, within the state of South Dakota. Our chapter volunteers are part of a nationwide network of nearly 25,000 caring people dedicated to making wishes come true. This page is about some of the great people at our chapter who are brightening the lives of wish kids. Although it has become one of the world's most well-known charities, the Make-A-Wish Foundation has maintained the grassroots fulfillment of its mission to serve children with life-threatening medical conditions. Volunteers serve as wish granters, fundraisers, special events assistants and in numerous other capacities.
