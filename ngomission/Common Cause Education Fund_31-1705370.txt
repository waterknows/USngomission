Founded in 2000, Common Cause Education Fund (CCEF) is the public education and research affiliate of Common Cause, a nonpartisan lobbying organization. Together, Common Cause and CCEF programs serve the organization's overall mission to strengthen public participation and faith in our institutions of self-government; ensure that government and the political process serve the general interest, rather than special interests; curb the excessive influence of money on government decisions and elections; promote fair and honest elections and high ethical standards for government officials; and protect the civil rights and civil liberties of all Americans.
