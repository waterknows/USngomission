United Way of West Central Mississippi works to advance the common good by focusing on education, income and health. These are the building blocks of a good life- a quality education, enough income to support a family, and good health. By bringing together people and resources to address these issues, and by attacking their underlying causes, we hope to make lasting, fundamental change for everyone. We aim build a stronger, healthier community by bringing together the human, financial and strategic resources necessary to deliver measurable improvements and solutions to the critical health and human services facing the communities we serve.
