Since its foundation in 1993, Greater Fox Cities Area Habitat for Humanity has built over 130 houses and counting in the Fox Cities, providing a new home for nearly 500 people in the community. Seeking to put God's love into action, Habitat for Humanity brings people together to build homes, communities and hope. Our mission is straightforward and to the point: to make simple, decent and affordable housing available to those who need it the most. This belief is what drives us in our work with Habitat for Humanity- when families have decent housing they can afford, many of life's other challenges become more manageable.
