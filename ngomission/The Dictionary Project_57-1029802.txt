The Dictionary Project works to assist all students in becoming good writers, active readers, creative thinkers, and resourceful learners by providing them with their own personal dictionary. The dictionaries are a gift to each student to use at school and at home for years to come. Educators see third grade as the dividing line between learning to read and reading to learn, so we encourage our sponsors to give dictionaries each year to children in the third grade. Since our founding in 1995, over 18 million children have received dictionaries because thousands of people saw the same need in communities all over the United States.
