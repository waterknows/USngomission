Seeking to put love and faith into action, Habitat for Humanity of Orange County brings people together to build homes, community and hope. We are the Orange County, California affiliate of Habitat for Humanity International. In response to God's love, Habitat for Humanity of Orange County creates long-term partnerships to build and renovate affordable housing with volunteers and responsible families in need. Knowing that owning a safe, decent home is a foundation from which families grow strong, Habitat provides blueprints and tools for revitalizing communities, neighborhoods, families, and lives. As an advocate, Habitat OC mobilizes communities to make adequate shelter a matter of conscience for God's people everywhere.
