Classroom, Inc.'s innovative curriculum engages students with the greatest needs and helps them develop academic skills essential for success in school and the workplace. Since 1991, our programs have been in over 700 sites in 15 states, and we have served over 600,000 students. Classroom, Inc.'s content-rich instructional programs turn classrooms into learning environments that motivate students through innovative teaching methods and materials based on the idea that young people learn better when they are compelled by their work. We develop computer software simulations that place students in virtual workplaces, create print curriculum materials corresponding to each simulation, and provide a comprehensive professional development program that helps teachers to effectively integrate our curriculum into their classroom instruction.
