The Southern Environmental Law Center uses the power of law and policy to protect the environment in six states: Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. SELC's attorneys work in all branches and at all levels of government to defend healthy air and clean water; to protect the region's forests, coasts, wetlands, and other native landscapes; and to promote vibrant and livable communities across the Southeast.
