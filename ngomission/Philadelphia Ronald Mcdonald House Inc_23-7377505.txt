The Philadelphia Ronald McDonald House provides a home away from home for families of critically ill children receiving treatment at local hospitals. We operate two Houses in Philadelphia serving a total of 59 families each night. The Philadelphia Ronald McDonald House also runs the Ronald McDonald Camp in the Poconos for oncology patients and their siblings. In addition we offer two Ronald McDonald Family Rooms in the Oncology and Cardiac Centers at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia to provide a respite space away from the bedside. Founded in 1974 as the very first Ronald McDonald House in the world, we are the model for the over 285 Houses throughout the globe.
