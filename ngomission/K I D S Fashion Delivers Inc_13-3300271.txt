Kids In Distressed Situations (K.I.D.S.) was founded in 1985 by children's industry executives, and in 2005 Fashion Delivers was created by adult apparel and home fashions professionals. On April 7, 2014 the two organizations merged to become K.I.D.S./Fashion Delivers, Inc., allowing us to better serve families in need and supporting our continuing efforts to aid kids and adults. We help fight poverty and tragedies through the gift of new products, including apparel, accessories, shoes, home furnishings, toys, books, school supplies and other items. Excess merchandise is donated from companies that make or market the goods, and we deliver hope and dignity to people in need through community nonprofit partners. Since 1985, over $1 billion of donated products have been distributed through our network, serving the poor and disadvantaged worldwide.
