The Boy Scouts of America, Cradle of Liberty Council was created on January 1, 1996 through the consolidation of the former Philadelphia and Valley Forge Councils. It serves more than 69,000 youth in over 1,000 units, making it one of the largest councils in the nation. The council is charged with both promoting and carrying out all types of Scouting programs in the three county area. In addition to the traditional Scouting disciplines, the council is also presenting Learning for Life programs to over 50,000 school youth in grades K-12. These programs are classroom based and feature age appropriate and grade specific lesson plans to enhance and support the core curricula of each school.
