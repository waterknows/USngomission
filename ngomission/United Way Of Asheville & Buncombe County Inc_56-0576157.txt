The United Way of Asheville & Buncombe County works to mobilize our community to help people improve their lives and care for one another. When we engage and mobilize people to give, advocate and volunteer, when we invest resources in and connect people to solutions in education, income and health and when we sustain and enhance the intellectual, financial and physical resources to carry out this work, then we improve lives and advance the common good.
