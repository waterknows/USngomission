Since our founding in 1920, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has led the fight to conserve our most precious liberties. Through the passion of our supporters, we have grown from a roomful of civil liberties activists to an organization of more than 500,000 active members and supporters with 54 state affiliate offices as well as a legislative office in Washington, DC. The ACLU of Michigan was officially established in 1959 to defend our civil liberties. The ACLU of Michigan's mission remains realizing the promise of the Bill of Rights for all and expanding the reach of its guarantees to new areas through all the tools at our disposal: public education, advocacy, organizing, and litigation.
