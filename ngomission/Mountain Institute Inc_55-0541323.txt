Mountains sustain life on earth. In a world facing unprecedented change, The Mountain Institute is committed to protecting its mountains. Through empowering mountain communities and conserving mountain eco-systems, TMI ensures that mountains will continue to provide the essential resources -- natural, cultural and inspirational -- needed for mankind's survival on a healthy planet. The Mountain Institute was founded in 1972. Our mission broadened in 1993 to include economic development and support for traditional cultures, as well as the conservation of natural resources in the world's longest, oldest, and highest mountain ranges - the Andes, Appalachians, and Himalayas. We implement programs directly with communities and work with and through a wide variety of development, government, program, academic, and technical partners.
