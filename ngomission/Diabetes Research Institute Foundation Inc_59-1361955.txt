The Diabetes Research Institute Foundation was created in 1971 by a small group of parents of children with diabetes - parents committed to finding a cure for this devastating disease. Driven by hope and fueled by the need to end their children's suffering, they banded together to support a promising research program at the University of Miami solely aimed at curing those living with diabetes. From providing the vital seed funding necessary to pursue innovative ideas, to bringing promising discoveries to patients now living with diabetes, the Foundation is a key to enabling the Diabetes Research Institute scientists to accelerate research.
