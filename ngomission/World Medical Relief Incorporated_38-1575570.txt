Established in 1953, World Medical Relief (WMR) is a multi-funded charitable organization whose mission is to impact the well-being of the medically impoverished on a local, national, and international basis. WMR achieves this through the collection of financial donations and goods, including medical, dental, and laboratory items, as well as through the purchase and distribution of such commodities. Goods are distributed in a non-discriminatory manner without regard to race, color, gender, religion, nationality or political beliefs. The Durable Medical Equipment provides low-income people with walkers, wheel chairs, commodes, and other medical equipment. Local Shipping provides tri-county area clinics with medical supplies and equipment, and the Medical Supply Program offers basic home health care supplies to individuals for a minimal charge.
