Free The Kids provides basic shelter, food, medical care, religious and educational instruction to the underprivileged in Haiti. Today, our primary residence is Hope Village or in Creole, Vilaj Espwa. Hope Village encompasses over 100 acres of land. At Hope Village we have planted a farm, built dormitories and schools and begun vocational training to teach the children viable trades to secure their future. We have over 550 children living at Hope Village and hundreds more coming to our schools each day from poor neighboring communities.
