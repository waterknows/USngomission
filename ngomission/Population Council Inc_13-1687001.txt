The Population Council, an international, nongovernmental organization, seeks to improve the well-being and reproductive health of current and future generations around the world and to help achieve a humane, equitable, and sustainable balance between people and resources. Since 1952, the Population Council has been the premier international organization conducting biomedical, public health, and social science research on population issues. The Council has been instrumental in the design of health products, service-delivery programs, and public policies responsive to the needs of people living in the world's poorest countries.
