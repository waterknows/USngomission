The ALS Association is the only not-for-profit voluntary health organization dedicated solely to the fight against ALS. The Minnesota Chapter was incorporated in 1993 when patients, families and related professionals banded together to share in their struggle with this tragic disease and to provide care services, community education and support of national research. We currently serve the states of Minnesota, North Dakota, parts of South Dakota and Superior, WI. We work together with the National Office to accomplish our mission. The MN/ND/SD focuses primarily on helping local patients and families live with ALS while the National Office focuses primarily on research and advocacy. The Chapter supports the National Office through revenue sharing and research contributions. The National Office supports the Chapters by providing up-to-date information and materials.
