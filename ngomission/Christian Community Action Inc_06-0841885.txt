Our mission is to provide emergency shelter and transitional housing, food, advocacy and leadership education and training and other support to those who are poor, in particular families that are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. CCA seeks to encourage these families and individuals in their efforts to attain economic self sufficiency and financial independence and to work with them to change systems that perpetuate unemployment / underemployment, homelessness, hunger, poverty and injustice and to promote community building and social change.
