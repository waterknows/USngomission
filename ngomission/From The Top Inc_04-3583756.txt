From the Top is America's largest national platform dedicated to celebrating the stories, talents, and character of classically-trained young musicians. Through live events, NPR and YouTube broadcasts, scholarships, and leadership programs, we empower these extraordinary young people to engage and inspire music lovers of all ages.Our classically-trained musicians, ages 8­­-18, astonish audiences with their skill and talent. Their hard work, dedication, and passion make them role models for their peers (and adults, too!). Yet, when they tell us about their lives outside of music, we are reminded that they are typical kids and teenagers, with normal worries and big dreams. In this winning combination we see a bright future, filled with the joy and hope that music offers to the world.
