Formerly known as Blacksmith Institute, Pure Earth's mission is to identify and clean up the poorest communities throughout the developing world where high concentrations of toxins have devastating health effects. Toxic pollutants affect the health of more than 200 million people worldwide. The number of people affected is comparable to HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria. Yet pollution is one of the most underreported and underfunded problems in the world. The majority of acutely toxic sites are caused by local business, many of them artisanal or small-scale. Abandoned sites are also quite common. Surprisingly, international companies are rarely implicated. Women and children are especially at risk suffering neurologic and immune system damage and an early death. Pure Earth devises clean-up strategies, empowers local champions and secures support from national and international partnerships. Cleaning up one community at a time brings us closer to a Pure Earth.
