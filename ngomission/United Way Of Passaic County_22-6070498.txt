United Way of Passaic County envisions a community where every child is ready to succeed in school, every person can meet their most basic needs and everyone can pursue productive and satisfying lives. The organization is committed to creating lasting change - from our Financial Empowerment Zone to our Hunger-Free Communities work. United Way of Passaic County is uniquely positioned to leverage its own health and human services expertise, a powerful base of donors and volunteers, public advocacy and outcome-based funding to help identify and solve chronic community-wide issues within our region.
