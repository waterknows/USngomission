Mobile Meals glorifies God by providing nutritious meals, services and fellowship to the frail and homebound citizens in Spartanburg County. We began on October 3, 1977, serving 25 meals with 15 volunteers. Today we serve nearly 2,000 residents with approximately 150 volunteers each weekday. Mobile Meals is much more than a meal. We provide nourishment for the mind, body and soul. Mobile Meals delivers love, compassion and hope to those in need. Our ministry includes meal delivery, case management and a lay pastor.
