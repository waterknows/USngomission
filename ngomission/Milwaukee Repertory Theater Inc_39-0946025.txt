The Milwaukee Repertory Theater (The Rep) is dedicated to providing the highest level of professional theater to Milwaukee and Wisconsin. Its legacy began in 1954, with a plan to create a professional theater for the city. In the early 1960s, the company reorganized to create a resident acting company and expand its repertoire to include classics and premieres of new works. The name Milwaukee Repertory Theater was chosen in 1963 to reflect this new philosophy. The Rep maintains a wide variety of programs to serve the community, including education programs, serving over 20,000 students annually, adult acting classes, public lectures, discussions, pre-show The Rep in Depth presentations in the Powerhouse, and audience talkbacks.
