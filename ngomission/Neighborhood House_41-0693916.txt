Founded in 1897, The Neighborhood House mission is to help people, families and organizations develop the skills, knowledge, and confidence to thrive in diverse communities. Over 110 years later, Neighborhood House is a vibrant, thriving organization serving immigrants, refugees and low-income populations in need of a helping hand. Multi- lingual and multi-cultural, the organization serves people from around the world, who relocate to Minnesota seeking a better life for themselves and their families. In a comprehensive effort to break the cycle of poverty, Neighborhood House operates diverse programs that work together to stabilize lives.
