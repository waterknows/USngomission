Sioux Empire United Way is changing lives right here in the Sioux Empire. Our focus is to identify and respond to needs in the community, creating opportunities for a better tomorrow. We strive to create opportunities for a better tomorrow, while ensuring the needs of today are also met. Recent programs, like Starting Strong in the Sioux Empire strive to ensure our community's youngest members have opportunities to thrive and develop. Genesis is connecting families who are homeless or at-risk of becoming homeless with volunteer mentor teams that support and provide resources to achieve long-term stability. Our latest initiative, USucceed, will provide at-risk high school students with long-term mentors who will encourage school success and preparation for adulthood.
