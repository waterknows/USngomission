Mission Arlington/Mission Metroplex began in August of 1986, when we decided that if people couldn't come to the church, for whatever reason, we would take the church to them. Today people of all ages gather each week to hear the Bible taught in multiple languages in 270 locations in Arlington and the larger Dallas-Fort Worth region. We meet in neighborhood homes, apartment club houses, mobile home parks, and in any other location where people can gather together to hear God's Word. The Bible studies that we provide for people, and the ministries that exist in and through the mission, work in harmony for a common goal - helping people find a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
