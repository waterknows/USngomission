At Ronald McDonald House Charities, we strive to reduce the burden of childhood illness on children and their families. We provide temporary lodging in a home-like setting with private bedrooms, as well as dining, kitchen and recreational areas. Ronald McDonald House Charities serves families whose children are receiving care for a serious illness or injury at a Kansas City area hospital or treatment facility. Many of the children we serve are admitted to the hospital for: pediatric intensive care, burns, cardiac care, hematology, oncology and neo-natal intensive care. The first Kansas City Ronald McDonald House began in 1980 with the purchase of a three-story colonial home. We have 3 Houses that provide a Home away from Home for 80 families a night as well as a Ronald McDonald Family Room inside Children's Mercy Hospital with 7 sleeping room.
