Founded in 1980, Alzheimer's Family Services Center (AFSC) provides care solutions for people in various stages of memory loss Monday through Friday. The facility offers therapeutic activities, health and care coordination, counseling, and socialization for participants, as well as much-needed caregiver support and education for families. AFSC's mission is to improve quality of life for families challenged by Alzheimer's disease or another dementia through services tailored to meet individual needs. The agency is affiliated with Hoag Neurosciences Institute and works closely with the Orange County Vital Brain Aging Program launched by Hoag to raise awareness and improve understanding about the benefits of early detection and proper Alzheimer's disease treatment.
