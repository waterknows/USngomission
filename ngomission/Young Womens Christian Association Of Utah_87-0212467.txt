Since 1906 the YWCA Utah has been a voice for women, a force for change, and a place for hope. Our enduring belief is that better lives for women - all women - will lead to stronger families and communities. Throughout the years the YWCA's underlying purpose has remained the same but we have changed as women have changed, as the needs of our families have changed, and as our world has changed. Since our earliest years we have responded to the needs and aspirations of local women with innovative programs, promoted the rights and interests of women, and advocated for positive social change that creates better lives for all.
