Habitat for Humanity is a nonprofit, ecumenical Christian housing ministry with independent affiliates working locally in communities around the world to select and support homeowners, organize volunteers, and coordinate house building. Since its founding in 1976, Habitat has built more than 400,000 homes worldwide, providing shelter for more than 1 million people in nearly 90 countries. At Habitat for Humanity-MidOhio, we seek to put God's love into action by bringing people together to inspire hope, build homes, empower families, and develop communities in Franklin and Licking Counties. Since 1987 we have empowered more than 300 families to realize their dream of affordable homeownership. We recently expanded our programs to include home rehabilitation and critical home repair, and we are working in collaboration with neighborhood residents, community partners, Habitat donors, and volunteers to revitalize low-income neighborhoods through a broader array of housing services.
