Founded in 1892, Northland College has distanced itself from the traditional collegiate academic routine since 1971, when it took the visionary step of blending an environmental focus with a liberal arts mission. More than 35 years later, others are only now playing catch-up. Long before green and global climate change became part of our national conversation, Northland was building its national reputation as a leader in environmental and sustainability issues. Passionate teaching is at the heart of a Northland education.
