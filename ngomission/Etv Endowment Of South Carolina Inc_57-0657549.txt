Founded in 1977, the ETV Endowment of South Carolina supports the South Carolina Educational Television (ETV) and Radio Network. Through partnerships with major foundations and corporations combined with state funds and membership contributions, the ETV Endowment has established a strong public-private sector alliance. This enables South Carolina to be among the major producers for public broadcasting, to be a designated satellite uplink for instructional programming to the schools of the nation and to provide millions of dollars in program and production services.The ETV Endowment was named the recipient of the 2014 Award for Nonprofit Excellence by the South Carolina Association of Nonprofit Organizations, in recognition of the exceptional and ethical business practices in place in the organization.
