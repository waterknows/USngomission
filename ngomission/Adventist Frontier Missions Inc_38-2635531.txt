Organized in 1985, Adventist Frontier Missions (AFM) is a Seventh-day Adventist Christian lay ministry dedicated to establishing church-planting movements among people groups with no Adventist presence. There are over 1.5 billion people who will never hear the gospel unless someone goes and tells them. Jesus Christ called us to go and share the gospel with these unreached people. Our missionaries learn the language and culture and begin raising up a body of believers, committed to spreading the gospel among their people. Our completed projects have a mother church with at least one daughter church and one granddaughter church. These finished projects are strong and growing with church members committed to and trained for outreach.
