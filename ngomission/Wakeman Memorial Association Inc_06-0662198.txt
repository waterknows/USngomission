The Wakeman Boys and Girls Club was founded on Christmas Day in 1913 with the mission to guide and inspire young people, especially those that need us most, to reach their full potential as productive, caring and responsible citizens. Wakeman Boys and Girls Club operates three clubhouses: Southport, Stratfield and Smillow-Burroughs and continues to help young people grow up to BE GREAT!
