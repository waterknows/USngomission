Fistula Foundation funds treatment of obstetric fistula, a childbirth injury most commonly caused by obstructed labor in countries where women too often give birth at home, without access to trained medical help. Obstetric fistula renders a woman incontinent, which can ruin her life: her husband too often leaves and community too often abandons her because they cannot stand her smell. But, through the inexpensive fistula repair surgeries that Fistula Foundation donors help fund, which cost $586 on average, a woman's health is restored and her life is transformed. Founded in 2000, the Foundation is active in more than 20 countries and has supported nearly 18,000 surgeries, more fistula surgeries than any other nonprofit organization not receiving government funding.
