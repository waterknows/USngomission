Since 1976 Please Touch Museum (PTM) has been the children's museum of Philadelphia. Our museum was the first in the nation whose target audience was families with children seven and younger. We have grown into one of the best children's museums in the nation, have become experts in play and have had our programs for under served families in the region nationally recognized. Our mission, to enrich the lives of children by creating learning opportunities through play, enables us to lay the foundation for a lifetime of learning and cultural awareness. PTM prides itself on its scope of community programming and ongoing efforts to assess, design and implement programs that meet the evolving needs of children and families. The museum serves children of all socio-economic backgrounds by educating children and those who nurture their development.
