Created in 1967, Miami Foundation exists to enhance the quality of life for all residents of Miami - Dade County. Our mission is to encourage philanthropy and charitable giving by developing a permanent endowment to meet current and future emerging charitable needs. The Foundation approaches our grant making not solely in terms of program categories, but rather with a focus on community building. By bringing together diverse groups in Miami-Dade County we help improve the quality of life and build a more cohesive community. The Foundation supports local nonprofit organizations with grants and technical assistance. It makes grants in the broad program areas of education, health, human services, arts and culture, environment, community and economic development.
