Since our beginning in 1983, Grand Island Public Schools Foundation has made it our mission and goal to enhance a tax-funded education by creating additional opportunities for students through philanthropic means. Our generous donors have given us the capacity to invest approximately $750,000 annually into programs benefiting students of the Grand Island Public Schools. Programs and projects that fall under our enhancement umbrella include booster clubs, college scholarships for Grand Island Senior High graduates, the renovation of the W.J. Arrasmith Planetarium, the development of district vocational and recreational facilities, teacher and student recognition, alumni relations, the Grand Island Senior High Hall of Honor, the Classroom Mini-Grant Program, and the Student Kindness Fund.
