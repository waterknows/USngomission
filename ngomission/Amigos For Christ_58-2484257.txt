Founded in 1998, Amigos for Christ is an international organization. Our mission is to serve God by providing opportunities for missionaries and impoverished families to grow through life-changing experiences. We strive to develop rural communities based on a model that brings clean water and sanitation, health care, education, and economic opportunities to families. Each year, we host over 1400 missionaries in Chinandega, Nicaragua. Working side by side with the communities, we bridge language and cultural barriers and offer hope and opportunity.
