After 50 years of ministry in greater New York City area, the mission of Teen Challenge Brooklyn remains the same. We are committed to helping people who have been deeply damaged by drugs and other life-controlling problems. Our mission is to evangelize people with life-controlling problems and initiate the discipleship process to the point they can function as a Christian in society, applying spiritually motivated principles to relationships in family, job, and community. We want to help youth, adults and families become mentally sound, emotionally balanced, socially adjusted, physically well and spiritually alive through the transforming power of

Jesus Christ.
