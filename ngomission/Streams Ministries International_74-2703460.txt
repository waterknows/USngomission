In 1993, John Paul Jackson launched Streams Ministries International, a ministry that endeavors to encourage, motivate, and equip individuals to walk in greater maturity, wisdom, character, and holiness. Inspired by Psalm 46:4, "There is a river whose streams shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacle of the Most High," Streams Ministries seeks to touch people with the message of God's love, bring the awe of God back into the Church, and transform lives through the supernatural power of the Holy Spirit.
