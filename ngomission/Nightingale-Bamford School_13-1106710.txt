The mission of the Nightingale-Bamford School is to educate the minds and the hearts of its students in a challenging, vibrant community that prizes academic excellence. Founded in 1920, Nightingale is an independent K-12 girls' school that provides a classical curriculum to motivated students of varied backgrounds, interests, and talents. What they share is a demanding academic environment in which their teachers inspire them to love learning and to embrace curiosity, creativity, and hard work. Providing structure and a strong foundation from the start, the curriculum allows for increasing independence as students move through the Lower, Middle, and Upper Schools. In each division, small classes permit teachers to find their students' strengths and insist on their best efforts. Our commitment to the success of every girl is absolute.
