Puppies Behind Bars (PBB) trains prison inmates to raise service dogs for wounded war veterans and explosive-detection canines for law enforcement. The puppies live in prison with their inmate raisers from the age of 8 weeks to 24 months. Since 1997, PBB has raised more than 800 puppies. Through our Dog Tags program we place service dogs, free of charge, with wounded veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. The dogs learn special commands to help mitigate the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and TBI (traumatic brain injury). Since our first Dog Tags placement in 2008, we have paired 75 service dogs with wounded veterans in 26 states (as of April '15). We pair approximately 15 more exceptional service dogs with veterans each year. Additionally, more than 400 PBB-trained explosive-detection canines work with law enforcement agencies around the country. The dogs we raise transform the lives of the inmates who train them, and the lives of those they go on to serve.
