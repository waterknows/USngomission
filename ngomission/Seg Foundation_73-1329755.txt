The SEG Foundation advances geophysics today and inspires geoscientists for tomorrow through funding innovative activities and grant programs that benefit geophysicists, their professional community, the Society of Exploration Geophysicists, and the general public. The SEG community is facing two great challenges: the first is advancing geophysics today by promoting technical innovation and providing professional support to an increasingly global community of members; the second is attracting and inspiring young geoscientists to meet society's needs tomorrow for leading edge geophysics in an even more resource hungry and environmentally concerned world.
