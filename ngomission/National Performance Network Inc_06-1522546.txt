The National Performance Network (NPN) is a national organization supporting artists in the creation and touring of contemporary performing and visual arts. NPN is a group of diverse cultural organizers, including artists, working to create meaningful partnerships and to provide leadership that enables the practice and public experience of the arts in the United States. The NPN has brought innovative performing artists to all corners of the United States for more than 25 years. Begun in 1985 by David White at Dance Theatre Workshop in New York, NPN was founded to address the issues of artistic isolation and the economic constraints of moving art around the country and the sharing of artistic and community voices.
