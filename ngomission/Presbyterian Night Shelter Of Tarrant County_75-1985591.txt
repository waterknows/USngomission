Since 1984, the Presbyterian Night Shelter (PNS) in east Fort Worth has served the needs of Tarrant County's homeless. The largest provider of services for the homeless, PNS is the only free area emergency shelter without length-of-stay restrictions. Located in the shadows of downtown Fort Worth, the Shelter believes in respecting the dignity of its clients, while supplying meals, beds, and basic human care to an average of 704 homeless men and women every night and approximately 3,040 annually. PNS also provides counseling and resources (proper identification, permanent housing, employment, financial assistance, etc.) enabling clients to reenter mainstream society.
