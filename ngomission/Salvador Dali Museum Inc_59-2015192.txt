Opened in 1971, the Salvador Dalí Museum is the permanent home of the world's most comprehensive collection of the renowned Spanish artist's work. Compiled by A. Reynolds Morse and Eleanor Morse over a 45-year period, it is celebrated for its 96 oil paintings. With oils spanning from 1917 through 1970, the collection provides an excellent overview of Dalí's major themes and symbols. In addition to the 96 oil paintings, the collection includes over 100 watercolors and drawings, 1,300 graphics, photographs, sculptures and objects d'art, and an extensive archival library. Periodic rotations of the collection and special exhibitions allow museum goers to view new work on repeat visits.
