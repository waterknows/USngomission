Seattle Art Museum (SAM) provides a welcoming place for people to connect with art and to consider its relationship to their lives. SAM is one museum in three locations: Seattle Art Museum downtown, Seattle Asian Art Museum at Volunteer Park, and the Olympic Sculpture Park. The Museum collects and exhibits objects from across time and across cultures, exploring the dynamic connections between past and present. The collections of the Seattle Art Museum number approximately 23,000 objects. In May 2007, the Museum celebrated the grand reopening of SAM Downtown, allowing the Museum to accommodate its growing collections, exhibition programs and audiences with 300,000 square feet of new gallery and public space adjacent to the museum's existing 150,000 square feet.
