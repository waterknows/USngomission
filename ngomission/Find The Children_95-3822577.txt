Since 1983, Find the Children has been dedicated to the recovery of missing children and to the prevention of the abuse and endangerment of children. We assist families searching for missing children by helping them to access local and federal law enforcement, advising them on the appropriate legal documents, and connecting them with other non-profit organizations or community resources that may help them in their search for their children. We educate parents and children on child safety, and work closely and in conjunction with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Since our founding, we have assisted thousands of families through our volunteer flyer distribution program and our photo partner program, which sends children's pictures to newspapers and periodicals all over the country.
