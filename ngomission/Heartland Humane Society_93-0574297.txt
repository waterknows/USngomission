Heartland Humane Society is a local animal welfare organization, founded in Benton County by a number of compassionate citizens in 1966. Our mission is to build a more compassionate community by teaching humane messages to our youth, caring for homeless animals and strengthening the human-animal bond. Our programs include running an open-door shelter where we care for more than 3,200 animals each year, visiting every local elementary school with programs that sow the seeds of compassion and teach responsible pet ownership as well as safety around animals, providing services for low-income pet guardians, behavior counseling and referrals, lost and found services, and many more programs.
