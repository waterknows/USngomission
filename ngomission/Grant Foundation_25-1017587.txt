The Grant Foundation's purpose is to operate Hôpital Albert Schweitzer (HAS) in Haiti. The inspiration to establish Hôpital Albert Schweitzer in Haiti came to Larimer and Gwen Mellon through a 1947 Life Magazine article about Dr. Albert Schweitzer. Construction of the hospital began in 1954, and it was opened in 1956. The mission of Hôpital Albert Schweitzer is to collaborate with the people of the Artibonite Valley as they strive to improve their health and quality of life. HAS provides medical care and community health and development programs for more than 350,000 impoverished people in the Artibonite Valley of central Haiti.
