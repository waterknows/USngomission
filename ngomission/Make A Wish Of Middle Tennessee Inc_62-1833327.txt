Make-A-Wish Middle Tennessee, founded in 2000, grants wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions to enrich the human experience with hope, strength and joy. Fulfilling a child's wish provides a joyful and meaningful experience that benefits both the child and the family. The Middle Tennessee chapter of Make-A-Wish is the youngest Make-A-WishÂ® chapter in the country. The chapter recently won national awards for Performance Excellence, Outstanding Fundraising Performance and for the 2008 Infinite Wish - Chase Donnell's Wish to Renovate His School Gymnasium.
