Founded in 1949, the Humane Society of the Pikes Peak Region (HSPPR) is dedicated to the care and protection of domesticated animals in our community. Our mission is to prevent animal cruelty and neglect and to promote a responsible community where animals are inherently valued and owners are committed to their pets. On average, more than 23,000 animals pass through the Humane Society of the Pikes Peak Region's doors annually: lost pets, injured animals, rescued animals, and surrendered animals. HSPPR is the largest animal shelter in southern and western Colorado, serving thousands of citizens and pets annually through our animal services, and by offering volunteer opportunities, education services and community outreach programs.
