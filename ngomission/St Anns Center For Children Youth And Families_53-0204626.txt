Chartered by President Abraham Lincoln on March 3, 1863, St. Ann's Center for children, youth and families (formerly St. Ann's Infant & Maternity Home) has continued to care for needy women and children in the Washington metropolitan area, adapting our programs and services to respond to the needs of the day. St. Ann's has served as an orphanage, an adoption agency, an emergency shelter for abused children, a training ground for teenage mothers and an affordable day care program for working families. St. Ann's provides help, love and support for more than 450 women and children through our children's residential, teen mother-baby, community day care and Faith House programs.
