The Fairbanks Museum was founded in 1889 by St. Johnsbury industrialist Franklin Fairbanks. We inspire appreciation for our place in the natural world and motivate our stewardship of a healthy planet. Inside our classic Victorian building, you will find a dazzling array of animals and artifacts, dolls and tools, shells and fossils, and much more!
