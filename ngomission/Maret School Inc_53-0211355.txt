Founded in 1911, Maret School is an independent, coeducational, K-12, college preparatory day school located on a single campus. In a community that embraces different cultures, interests, perspectives, and talents, we prepare our students to become responsible, thoughtful, and well-informed adults who are able to play an active role in improving the world. Emphasizing a combination of independence and widespread collaboration, we incorporate traditional academic rigor and innovative methods of teaching and inquiry. Within a relaxed atmosphere unencumbered by elaborate rules, we encourage a deep sense of each person's accountability to the school community. In all areas, we applaud high achievement while promoting a philosophy of nurtured risk-taking.
