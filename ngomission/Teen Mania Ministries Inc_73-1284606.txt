Founded in 1986 by Ron Luce and his wife Katie, Teen Mania Ministries works to provoke a young generation to passionately pursue Jesus Christ and to take His life-giving message to the ends of the earth. Teen Mania is not affiliated with one specific denomination, but works with all denominations. Each year, youth groups from over 50 denominations attend the Acquire the Fire youth events. We believe strongly in creating unity within the Body of Christ. To truly make a difference on this generation, the largest teenage generation in history, we must partner together. Teen Mania is committed to partnering with the local church by providing events, camps, and mission trips that facilitate life-changing encounters, leadership training for teens, and resources for parents and church leaders.
