The United Way of Buffalo & Erie County brings people, organizations, and resources together to improve community well-being. Since 1917, United Way has been empowering individuals, businesses and organizations to make our community stronger.Every year, United Way invests millions of dollars in local Education, Income, and Health & Wellness programs that help people in need. We match resources - such as money, volunteers and training - with community agencies that directly benefit people in Buffalo and Erie County. We offer strategic training and resources to area nonprofits through our Not For Profit Resource Center, and we provide extensive volunteer support through events such as Day of Caring, Family Volunteer Day, and Business Meets Community.
