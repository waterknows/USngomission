Four Corners School of Outdoor Education (FCS) was founded in 1984. Based in Monticello, Utah, FCS provides place-based outdoor education on and about the Colorado Plateau (Northern Arizona, Southwestern Colorado, Northwestern New Mexico, Southern Utah). Our mission is to create lifelong learning experiences about the Colorado Plateau bioregion for people of all ages and backgrounds through education, service, adventure, and conservation programs.
