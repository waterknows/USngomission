The Jacobs & Cushman San Diego Food Bank is the largest hunger-relief organization in San Diego County. Last year, the Food Bank distributed more than 20 million pounds of food, and the Food Bank served, on average, more than 350,000 people per month in San Diego County. The Food Bank receives food from the USDA, food manufacturers, food retailers, the agricultural sector, food drives, and through financial contributions that enable us to purchase protein-rich foods, fresh produce, and dry staple foods such as beans, oatmeal, and rice. We also benefit from the generosity of over 16,000 volunteers annually that help to sort and distribute donated and purchased food products.
