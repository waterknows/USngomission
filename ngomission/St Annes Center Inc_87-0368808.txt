St. Anne's Center exists to aid the poor, needy and homeless by providing them food, shelter and critical emergency services. We provide a hand up rather than a hand out. Our goal is to transition residents from shelter to housing; encouraging their sense of independence, self-sufficiency and self-confidence. We are committed to carry out this mission while treating those who come to us with compassion, dignity and respect.
