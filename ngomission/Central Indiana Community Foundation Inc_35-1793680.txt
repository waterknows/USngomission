Through the generosity of thousands of donors, Central Indiana Community Foundation (CICF) is the steward for more than $480 million in charitable assets. CICF transforms central Indiana in three ways: by consulting donors, family foundations, and their professional advisors on charitable giving; awarding grants to effective not-for-profit organizations; and providing leadership to address community needs and seize opportunities. CICF was established in 1997 as a partnership between The Indianapolis Foundation, serving Marion County since 1916, and Legacy Fund, serving Hamilton County since 1991. CICF's mission is to inspire, support, and practice philanthropy, leadership, and service in our community.
