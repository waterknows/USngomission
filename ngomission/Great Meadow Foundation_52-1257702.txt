Great Meadow Foundation was established in 1982 with the mission of preserving the property in perpetual open space for community activities. Nestled in the heart of Virginia's Piedmont countryside, Great Meadow is a 250-acre field events center and steeplechase course. It is the permanent home of the spring and fall Virginia Gold Cup races, the Family July 4th celebration, and the Great Meadow Polo Club. It has four ponds, a small open air stadium, polo field and space for public and private events and activities. About 250,000 people a year come to Great Meadow for our events or simply to enjoy its scenic beauty and tranquility.
