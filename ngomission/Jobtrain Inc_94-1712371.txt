JobTrain, formerly OICW, is an educational and training institution that also offers career counseling and job placement services to our graduates. We help our clients launch new careers and break out of the community's existing cycle of poverty, low education levels, homelessness, drugs, crime, and prison. Through each student's personal and professional growth, JobTrain is creating a new and positive model for other members of the community.
