With roots tracing back to 1910, the Jewish Community Federation of San Francisco, the Peninsula, Marin and Sonoma Counties works to protect and enhance Jewish life in our community through fundraising, strategic planning and providing funding for programs that care for those in need; that strengthen and secure the safety of the Jewish people; and that foster Jewish renaissance at home, in Israel and in other Jewish communities. We provide financial resources to help meet short- and long-term community needs; supply educational resources for children, adults, educators and families; keep the community informed about relevant current issues; and give people the opportunity for new experiences though programs and services.
