As the heart of the global wilderness community for over 40 years, The WILD Foundation protects wilderness while meeting the needs of human communities, working across cultures and boundaries by collaborating with local peoples, organizations, the private sector, and governments to create dynamic practical projects and communications initiatives. WILD's work promotes and demonstrates Nature Needs Half, a science-based and common-sense vision in which humans and wild nature share our planet so that large natural areas - land and water - are of sufficient size and are interconnected so they can continue to provide essential, life-supporting services that assure both human health and prosperity, and a bountiful, beautiful resource of wild nature. WILD is also the founder and steward of the World Wilderness Congress, the world's longest-running, public, international conservation program.
