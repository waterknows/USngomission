Founded in 1927, the Baltimore Humane Society provides a temporary home, safe refuge, and care for unwanted and homeless animals. We work aggressively to place each animal that comes to our shelter in a loving, permanent home. We strive to control the population of unwanted animals by promoting and offering low-cost spaying and neutering and vaccination services, and by addressing the issues that cause people to give up their animals. We work to advance the cause of humane treatment of animals and increase awareness of animal issues through public education and legislative efforts. We ensure a peaceful final resting place for beloved pets through the operation of a beautiful and well-maintained cemetery for companion animals, and we offer free pet bereavement counseling to grieving pet guardians.
