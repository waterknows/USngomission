The Boys & Girls Clubs of the Fox Valley's mission is to inspire and enable all young people, especially those who need us most, to reach their full potential as productive, responsible and caring citizens. The Boys & Girls Clubs of the Fox Valley will grow by providing an exemplary Club Experience for youth from throughout the Fox Cities area that ensures members are on track to graduate from high school, have a plan for their future, demonstrate good character and citizenship, and live a healthy lifestyle. We believe our purpose remains as important today as it was at the time of the organization's founding - to help make the Fox Valley a great place for all kids to grow. Remaining mindful of this, we will continue to prioritize inclusive youth development environments and services, ensuring all youth, especially those who need us most, have ready access to our programs and services.
