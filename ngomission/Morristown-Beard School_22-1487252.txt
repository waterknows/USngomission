Morristown-Beard School (MBS) is a coeducational college-preparatory day school for students in grades 6-12. MBS is the product of the 1971 merger of two institutions, Miss Beard's School for girls and The Morristown School for boys, both established in 1891. These schools throughout the years developed reputations for strong academic and athletic programs that emphasized the human qualities of teamwork, integrity, commitment, service and mutual respect between students and faculty. Today the school is a close-knit community of students and teachers where learning is reciprocal. Our deeply committed faculty is devoted to a learning program that easily encompasses a wide range of student abilities and provides a high degree of flexibility and sensitivity to a variety of learning styles.
