The One Way Farm was founded in 1976 in order to stop the cycle of child abuse and provide a loving environment for children to grow in mind, spirit and body. They care for the abused, abandoned, neglected, troubled youth, and children with disabilities and developmental disabilities in the State of Ohio without regard to race, color, sex, or national origin. The One Way Farm provides temporary/emergency housing, long-term independent housing, placement of children by the Juvenile Courts, Job and Family Services Department, and other placing agencies, and serves as an alternative to institutionalization for mildly troubled children, developmentally disabled and the physically challenged.
