The Library Foundation is an independent, community-based organization dedicated to enhancing our library's leadership, innovation and reach. Since its founding in 1995, the foundation has raised more than $35 million to enhance programs, collections and the renovation and expansion of our library system. Last year alone, projects supported by the foundation reached more than 290,000 people in our community. Multnomah County Library is one of the most important cultural and educational resources in our region. The foundation and the library work together, in a strong partnership, to determine where private support can have the greatest impact and at the same time, not supplant the public's responsibility for funding the basic operations of a strong library system.
