The Adirondack Council is an environmental group that has been working since 1975 to protect the open-space resources of New York State's six-million-acre Adirondack Park and to help sustain the natural and human communities of the region. The Council is the largest citizen environmental group in New York State working full-time, on a daily basis in the Adirondack Park, in the state capital and in Washington to preserve this six-million-acre treasure. The Council's protection efforts include: advocacy and lobbying for land use planning and land protection; research issues that affect the ecology and economy of the Park; public education through media and schools; environmental monitoring on the local, state, and national levels; and litigation, when necessary.
