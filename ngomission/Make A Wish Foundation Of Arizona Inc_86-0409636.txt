Make-A-Wish® Arizona grants the wishes of Arizona children with life-threatening medical conditions to enrich the human experience with hope, strength and joy. Make-A-Wish Arizona is the founding Make-A-Wish® chapter, starting in Phoenix in 1980 with one little boy's wish to be a police officer. From these humble beginnings, Make-A-Wish was born. Make-A-Wish Arizona grants wishes to children who have been diagnosed by their doctor or medical physician as having a life-threatening medical condition and who are between 2 1/2 - 18 years of age at the time of referral. Each year, Make-A-Wish Arizona grants approximately 350 wishes to Arizona children and has granted almost 5,000 wishes to date (Spring 2015). Make-A-Wish Arizona's vision is to grant the wish of every eligible Arizona child. Studies have shown that wishes help children feel stronger, happier, and more willing to battle their illness.
