Established in 1854, the YMCA of Pittsburgh builds strong kids, strong families, strong communities through programs that build healthy spirit, mind and body for all. The YMCA of Greater Pittsburgh is a nationally affiliated character building social services agency focusing on program services for individuals and families. Christian in its heritage, it is ecumenical in its delivery of services and its membership. The YMCA assists people in learning the skills and attitudes that will enrich their lives, lead them to interracial and intergenerational understanding and to realize their full potential as members of this community. The YMCA emphasizes development of the whole person as embodied in the YMCA symbol, the triangle, signifying the union of the spirit, the mind and the body.
