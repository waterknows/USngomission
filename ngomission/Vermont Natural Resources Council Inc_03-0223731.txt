For over 40 years, Vermont Natural Resources Council (VNRC) has been Vermont's leader in protecting and restoring our natural resources. By building coalitions, working together, and offering common sense solutions, VNRC has set the standard for an approach to environmental protection that endures. VNRC keeps Vermonters informed on the environmental issues that you and your family care most about. We keep a constant presence in the Vermont State House to promote a vision of a Vermont that is healthy and sustainable. We empower our members to take action when the voice of concerned citizens is needed to make a difference. VNRC is the Vermont affiliate of the National Wildlife Federation.
