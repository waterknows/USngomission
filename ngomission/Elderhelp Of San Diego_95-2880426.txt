ElderHelp is comprised of professionals and community volunteers committed to offering quality social services that help seniors live independently in their own homes. Our mission is to provide personalized services and information that help seniors remain independent and live with dignity in their own homes. We serve seniors with the fewest resources and the least support. Founded in 1973 as a community-based volunteer organization in the inner city neighborhood of North Park, ElderHelp has grown to become a regional community resource for seniors and their families. Our main office is located in the heart of San Diego.
