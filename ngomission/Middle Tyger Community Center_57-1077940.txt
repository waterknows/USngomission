Middle Tyger Community Center (MTCC) brings together state and local agencies to support the District Five Area and adjoining areas of the county. Located in the former Lyman Elementary School, MTCC includes programs ranging from adolescent pregnancy prevention and support for pregnant and parenting adolescents to family counseling, family support services, crisis intervention, and educational opportunities for all ages. In the spirit of the Middle Tyger Area's desire to create healthy families, we seek to encourage and assist all citizens to develop solutions to the problems identified in our community and foster collaboration among agencies, people who want to help, and those who need help.
