Now in its 131st year, the Heinz History Center continues to preserve and present Pittsburgh's past. Founded in 1879, the Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania (which operates the History Center) is Pittsburgh's oldest cultural institution. It is an educational institution that engages and inspires a large and diverse audience with links to the past, understanding in the present, and guidance for the future by preserving regional history and presenting the American experience with a Western Pennsylvania connection. 



The History Center now represents the cutting edge of the history-museum field and has received national recognition. The collections, exhibitions, publications, and programming supported by the History Center have made it an invaluable asset to Western Pennsylvania. The History Center is a Smithsonian affiliate, and also operates the Meadowcroft Rockshelter and Historic Village and Fort Pitt Museum. It is accredited by the American Association of Museums.
