American Friends of Yeshivot Bnei Akiva (AFYBA) is the American fund raising arm of Yeshivot Bnei Akiva (YBA) in Israel. YBA, the premier religious Zionist educational movement in Israel, was founded in 1939 by Rav Moshe Zvi Neriah, zt"l, when he opened Israel's first yeshiva high school with 13 students on a hilltop in Kfar Haroeh. Today, YBA has grown into a national movement encompassing 68 schools from the Golan to Eilat, serving more than 23,000 students of all backgrounds. This includes children from low-income homes, new immigrants, and the learning disabled. All of these students graduate from YBA with a profound love of Torah, the Jewish People and the Land of Israel, which they carry with them for the rest of their lives.
