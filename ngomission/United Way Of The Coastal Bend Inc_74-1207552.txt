United Way of the Coastal Bend is dedicated to creating long-lasting change. With a unique ability to bring together people active in their communities, business leaders, nonprofit organizations and government agencies, We address the underlying causes of major problems facing the Coastal Bend. United Way was built on the belief that together, we can accomplish more than any individual or organization can accomplish alone. We work toward long term solutions in the areas of education, income and health, believing these are the building blocks for a good life- a quality education that leads to a stable job, enough income to support a family through retirement, and good health for a more productive life. Our vision is to create long-lasting changes that prevent problems from happening in the first place.
