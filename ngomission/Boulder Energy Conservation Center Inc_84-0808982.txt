The Center for ReSource Conservation, formerly the Boulder Energy Conservation Center (BECC), was founded in 1976 by a group of community-minded citizens seeking ways to help reduce our dependence on non-renewable resources. The organization has since developed extensive expertise in the areas of green building, renewable energy, energy efficiency, waste reduction, and water conservation. We share practical solutions for environmental living through print and on-line communications materials, direct services, events, workshops, demonstration projects, tours, and walk-in/email/phone requests for information. Our goal is to tackle resource conservation issues close to home, provide accessible and affordable conservation solutions, and reduce the negative environmental impacts associated with non-sustainable practices.
