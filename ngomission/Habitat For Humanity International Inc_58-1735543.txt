Habitat for Humanity Saint Louis (HFHSL) is dedicated to eliminating substandard housing in St. Louis. This is accomplished by a comprehensive program that helps families who are determined to proactively better their lives by investing time and effort into actually building and owning a home. This is the hope that HFHSL builds in the hearts of many deserving people.Beyond our altruistic goals, HFHSL has a proven track record of fiscal responsibility, organizational efficiency, and non-profit management. The overarching goal is to aggressively keep up with the need for affordable housing. This goal is difficult and reliant upon funding from the private sector as HFHSL does not receive any financial assistance in building our homes from Habitat for Humanity International or United Way.
