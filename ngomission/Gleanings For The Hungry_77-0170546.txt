Gleanings For The Hungry partners with other mission organizations in approximately 40 nations by providing food products to distribute along with the message of the Gospel. In addition to dried fruit and soup mix, we often provide beans, rice, cereal, and energy bars. We offer a Discipleship Training School each fall, including an outreach trip for a hands on experience with the distribution of food and the Gospel to those in need.
