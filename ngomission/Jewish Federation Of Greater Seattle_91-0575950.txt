The Jewish Federation of Greater Seattle was established in 1926. Our mission is to ensure Jewish survival and enhance the quality of Jewish life locally, in Israel and worldwide. The Federation accomplishes its mission through an integrated planning, fund-raising and allocating process which is the most effective means of meeting the needs in the Jewish community, and offers a central coordination and support of Jewish projects. The Federation has a commitment to leadership development for the Seattle area Jewish community and Federation, supports educational programs for the entire community, and builds strong relationships both inside and outside the Jewish community.
