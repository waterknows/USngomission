At Bryan's House, we don't just care for children with special health needs. We provide kids with the quality of life they deserve. Our primary service is medically managed child care. We also provide child development programs, support groups, play therapy, school supplies and clothes, birthday and holiday gifts, summer camp, and most importantly, hugs and understanding! Our staff, volunteers and supporters give their time and resources to ensure that Bryan's House continues to safeguard not only our children's health, but the most precious gift of all - childhood. Originally founded in 1988 to care for HIV-infected children, Bryan's House expanded in 2006, after many requests, to another group of children, children with special health and developmental needs.
