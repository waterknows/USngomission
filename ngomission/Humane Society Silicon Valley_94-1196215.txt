Established in 1929, Humane Society Silicon Valley (HSSV) offers high-quality adoptions, medical care and educational programs to enhance the human-animal bond. Our mission is to save and enhance lives. We aim to eliminate the unnecessary euthanasia of 50,000 pets each year in the Bay Area. In the year ended June 30, 2013, we found loving homes for nearly 4,100 animals, including reuniting 200 lost pets with their families. Our Regional Rescue program saved 910 animals that were in danger of being euthanized at local shelters due to lack of resources or space. Our Medical Center served nearly 7,000 pet owners and their animals. Our Education Department served approximately 8,000 students through nationally recognized leading-edge programs.
