Hudson Institute is a non-partisan, policy research organization dedicated to innovative research and analysis that promotes global security, prosperity, and freedom. We challenge conventional thinking and help manage strategic transitions to the future through interdisciplinary and collaborative studies in defense, international relations, economics, culture, science, technology, and law. Since 1961, Hudson's perspective has been uniquely future-oriented and guardedly optimistic. Seeing the complexities within societies, we focus on the often-overlooked interplay among culture, demography, technology, markets, and political leadership. Through publications, conferences and policy recommendations, we seek to guide global leaders in government and business.
