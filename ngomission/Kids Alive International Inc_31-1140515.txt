Kids Alive International is a Christian faith mission dedicated to rescuing orphans and vulnerable children - meeting their spiritual, physical, educational, and emotional needs - raising them to be contributing members of their society and witnesses to their family and community. Founded in 1916, Kids Alive International began providing homes for homeless children. Since that time, Kids Alive has expanded to include not only children's homes but also care centers and schools. These programs provide orphans and abandoned children with an education, clothing, food, medical care (in some cases), and most importantly, the love of Christ.
