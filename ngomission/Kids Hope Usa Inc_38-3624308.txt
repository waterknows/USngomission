KIDS HOPE USA (KHUSA) offers churches and schools a model to meet the emotional, social and academic needs of children. KHUSA programs create one-on-one mentoring relationships between adult church members, willing to give a little time and a lot of love, and at-risk elementary schoolchildren in their community who desperately need loving, caring adults in their lives. Utilizing the existing structures of churches and elementary schools as the framework for these programs, KIDS HOPE USA creates successful, sustainable and life-changing church-school partnerships.
