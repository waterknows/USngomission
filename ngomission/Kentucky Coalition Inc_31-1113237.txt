The Kentucky Coalition exists to support the research and education activities of Kentuckians For The Commonwealth, a statewide citizens' organization working for a new balance of power and a just society by using direct action to challenge and change unfair political, economic and social systems. We provide research, leadership training and communication that informs and inspires effective action.
