The Elks are American Citizens who want to save its great values; who love others and want to make sure they are healthy and happy; and who love life and want to contribute to it, as well as to share it. The California-Hawaii Elks Major Project, a committee of the California-Hawaii Elks Association, pledges its commitment to addressing the unmet needs of children with disabilities throughout the states of California and Hawaii by developing a program of supporting services to aid these children at no cost to their families and without discrimination.
