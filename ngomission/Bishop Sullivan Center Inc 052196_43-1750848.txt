Founded in 1996, Bishop Sullivan Center is one of the largest providers of emergency assistance in the Kansas City area. Our mission is to provide basic necessities to people who are unable to do so, and to assist those who are able, to become financially self-sufficient by finding employment. The Bishop Sullivan Center main location is on Truman Road. Services provided include a food pantry, emergency assistance, an employment program, and services to the indigent elderly. St. James Place on Troost provides the same services provided on Truman Road, plus a Community Kitchen where hot meals are served 5 nights a week.
