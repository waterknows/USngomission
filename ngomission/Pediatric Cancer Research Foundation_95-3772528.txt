The Pediatric Cancer Research Foundation (PCRF) was established in 1982 to improve the care, quality of life and survival rate of children with malignant diseases. The founders included parents, doctors, friends, and business and community leaders who joined forces to translate laboratory research into immediate treatment for children with cancer. Since its inception, PCRF has raised over $36 million to fund cutting edge research that leads to medically sound treatment protocol for childhood cancers.
