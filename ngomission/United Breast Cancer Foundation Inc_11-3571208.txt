The United Breast Cancer Foundation's (UBCF) mission is to make a positive difference in the lives of those affected by breast cancer. We aid in providing screening, treatment, after-care, educational material, patient and family assistance and information. UBCF provides grants to hospitals and community health centers to benefit patients and families coping with breast cancer. We strive to alleviate the stress and strain that cancer can cause to patients and families and to foster health and well-being through both traditional and holistic treatments by never denying anyone service regardless of age, race, gender or income.
