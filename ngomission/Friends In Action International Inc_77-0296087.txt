FRIENDS in Action International works to assist missionary groups and individuals around the world with similar purposes in helping to lighten their load in some way -- enabling them to continue in their work of reaching the unreached. We fulfill this purpose by building missionary homes and medical clinics; drilling water wells; erecting radio station towers; constructing bridges; building airstrips in remote jungle locations; shipping containers of supplies to missionaries around the world; providing equipment large and small; sending work teams to come alongside missionaries to help them accomplish their work. Our four main areas of focus are missionary services, work teams, equipment projects, and sending missionaries.
