Presbyterian Children's Homes and Services of Missouri (formerly known as Children's Foundation of Mid-America) provides Christ-centered care to children and families in need. Founded in 1914, PCHAS-MO serves more than 2,200 children and families each year and make a real difference in their lives - whether they are struggling with poverty, physical or mental illness, abuse or neglect. Since the agency's beginning as an orphanage serving children in the Lead Belt of Missouri, our agency has grown into a state-wide organization offering a continuum of care that includes residential treatment, counseling, mentoring, education, foster care case-management and intensive in-home care for families in crisis.
