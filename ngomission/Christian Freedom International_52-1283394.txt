The mission of Christian Freedom International (CFI) is to help Christians who are persecuted for their faith in Jesus Christ. We are a nondenominational human rights organization providing aid, advocacy, and Bibles to Christians in areas of intense persecution. Our mandate is to reach the part of the persecuted Church that is the most repressed, at risk, and isolated. As a U.S. based, grass roots organization, we mobilize Christians in prayer, advocacy, and action on behalf of men, women, and children who are harassed, tortured, imprisoned, and martyred for their faith.
