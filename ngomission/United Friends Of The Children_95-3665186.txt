United Friends of the Children (UFC) was founded in 1979 to respond to the unmet needs of Los Angeles County's most vulnerable and underserved population, the foster youth. UFC is dedicated to bettering the lives of foster children and to supporting former foster youth in their journey to become successful, independent adults. Through our housing and education programs, foster youth are provided with the opportunity to graduate from high school, attend and graduate from college, get a job, find housing and have a support system that moves them gradually towards independence. Currently, UFC provides services and support to more than 1,500 foster youth each year throughout Los Angeles County.
