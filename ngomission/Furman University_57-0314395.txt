A private liberal arts university, Furman University was founded in 1826, and is nationally acclaimed for its academic excellence, Engaged Learning program and campus beauty. Furman offers degrees in 42 fields of study, a student-to-faculty ratio of 11:1, and enrolls 2,601 undergraduates and 417 graduate students from 48 states and 47 foreign countries. The hallmark of a Furman education is engaged learning: an approach to the liberal arts that combines the best of classroom education with opportunities to put what students learn into practice in the laboratory, the workplace, the community and the world. Five basic principles work together to give students a truly engaged experience: active learning, research, internships, service learning and technology.
