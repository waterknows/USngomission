Since 1959, the Oregon Lions Sight & Hearing Foundation has taken an active role in protecting the health of Oregonians. Through nine direct service programs related to sight, hearing and health assistance, the Foundation has transformed the lives of hundreds of thousands of youths and adults in our state. Consistent access and critical health solutions are offered to the most vulnerable members of our community who are uninsured or under insured.
