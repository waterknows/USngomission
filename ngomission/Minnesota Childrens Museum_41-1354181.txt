In 1981, the first children entered the original Minnesota Children's Museum (MCM), known as Minnesota's AwareHouse, in downtown Minneapolis. Since then, MCM has provided learning-infused play experiences for over six million visitors. Through its exhibits and programs, the Museum helps children discover themselves and the world around them through experimentation, creative self-expression, investigation and role-playing. Although the Museum's innovative traveling exhibits and signature daily programs are well-known throughout the community, the mission of the Museum extends far beyond downtown St. Paul. As the leading traveling exhibit developer for children's museums nationwide, the Museum sparks learning in young children across the continent.
