Founded in 2001, Public Knowledge (PK) preserves the openness of the Internet and the public's access to knowledge; promotes creativity through balanced copyright; and upholds and protects the rights of consumers to use innovative technology lawfully. Public Knowledge works at the intersection of copyright, telecommunications, and Internet law, at a time when these fields are converging. PK's experience in all three areas puts it in 

an ideal position to advocate for policies that serve the public interest.
