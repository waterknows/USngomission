The National Leadership Roundtable on Church Management is an organization of laity, religious, and clergy working together to promote excellence and best practices in the management, finances, and human resource development of the Catholic Church in the U.S. through the greater incorporation of the expertise of the laity. We are a Catholic 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that brings together leaders from the worlds of business, finance, academia, philanthropy, non-profit organizations, and the Church to serve the Catholic Church in the United States. The Leadership Roundtable serves the Church through our Standards for Excellence program; ChurchEpedia, our collection of best practices; and consultancy services, which have assisted several archdioceses, dioceses, and religious communities across the country.
