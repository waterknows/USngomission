Since 1958, the spirited people of Montana Wilderness Association have worked to protect Montana's wilderness, wildlife habitat, and traditional recreation opportunities. We were instrumental in the passage of the 1964 Federal Wilderness Act and in the designation of every Wilderness area in the state. We also helped win Wild and Scenic designations for the Missouri and Flathead rivers, and National Monument status for the stunning Upper Missouri River Breaks. We are currently working in communities statewide to obtain new wilderness designations. Complementing these efforts to gain new wilderness, our members take action regularly to ensure state and national agencies appropriately identify and manage all wild lands in Montana.
