Since 1957 the League to Save Lake Tahoe has been the leading advocacy organization dedicated solely to the protection and restoration of Lake Tahoe and its surrounding basin. For 55 years the League to Save Lake Tahoe has advocated for strong protection of the Tahoe Basin's natural resources and the restoration of its famed clear water. Through our advocacy and education programs, the League to Save Lake Tahoe promotes important restoration efforts and seeks to prevent further harm to Tahoe's sensitive watershed. We have three primary program areas - advocacy and monitoring, legislative advocacy, and education and outreach--and we are currently working on a number of campaigns and projects.
