The mission of Planned Parenthood of Santa Barbara, Ventura & San Luis Obispo Counties is to actively promote family planning and healthy, responsible reproductive and sexual behavior through the provision of high-quality, comprehensive, educational, counseling, medical, and referral services. We support the availability of these services, particularly to individuals whose access to other sources of help is limited. We promote public understanding, acceptance and support for reproductive choice and family planning services. We also promote public understanding of global problems that stem from population pressures and encourage support of programs working toward solutions to these problems.
