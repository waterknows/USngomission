The Tri-County Humane Society (TCHS) was incorporated on December 11th, 1974. In recognition of the bond between humans and animals, the TCHS exists to practice and promote humane principles, compassionate care, and the prevention of cruelty to animals. This society serves the community, both animals and people, primarily by providing quality care and adoption services for animals in need; offering educational programs to encourage the awareness, understanding and practice of humane principles; and handling questions and complaints regarding animal care and behavior, including alleged cruelty and neglect cases.
