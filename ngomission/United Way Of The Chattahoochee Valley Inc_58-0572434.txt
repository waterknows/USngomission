United Way of the Chattahoochee Valley works to create positive change in the Chattahoochee Valley by collaborating with partners and bringing resources together to improve people's lives. We focus on four core areas: basic needs (food and shelter), income (promoting financial stability leading towards independence), health (improving emotional, mental and physical well-being), and education (helping children and youth reach their potential). United Way of the Chattahoochee Valley currently has 26 community partner agencies and funds 50 programs that help thousands of individuals, families and children in the Chattahoochee Valley.
