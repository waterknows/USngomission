Nashville Inner City Ministry (NICM) began in 1979 as an outreach to the young people living in the public housing projects of Nashville's inner city. Today, a core group of 1,000 dedicated volunteers enter every major public housing development in Nashville's inner city communities and transport up to 1,000 children and teenagers to life skill Bible classes that are held in locations throughout Nashville and the surrounding communities. Many of the young people that NICM works with find themselves homeless, helpless, hopeless, hungry, and hostile. With patience and encouragement, all of life's problems can be endured and a positive, healthy quality of life can be born out of despair at any point in someone's life.
