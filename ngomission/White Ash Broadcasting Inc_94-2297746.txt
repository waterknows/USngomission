Since our incorporation in 1975, Valley Public Radio has been a leader in providing classical music, cultural arts, National Public Radio news, and innovative local programming to the listeners of the San Joaquin Valley. Our mission is to serve expanding audiences through quality communication services that are informative, innovative, educational and stimulating. Programming is expected to expand the listener's awareness of his/her world, and to present that which the listener may not know exists. The 2,450-watt Fresno and 11,000-watt Bakersfield transmitters reach listeners throughout Merced, Madera, Fresno, Kings, Tulare, and Kern counties, as well as portions of Mariposa, Tuolumne, San Joaquin, and Stanislaus counties. The potential audience for this region is 1.5 million listeners.
