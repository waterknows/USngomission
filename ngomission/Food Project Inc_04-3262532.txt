Since 1991, The Food Project has built a national model of engaging young people in personal and social change through sustainable agriculture. Each year, we work with over 140 teens and thousands of volunteers to farm on 31 acres in rural Lincoln, MA, nine acres in Beverly and Ipswich, 2 1/2 acres in Boston and one acre in Lynn. We consider our hallmark to be our focus on identifying and transforming a new generation of leaders by placing teens in unusually responsible roles, with deeply meaningful work. Our mission is to grow a thoughtful and productive community of youth and adults from diverse backgrounds who work together to build a sustainable food system.
