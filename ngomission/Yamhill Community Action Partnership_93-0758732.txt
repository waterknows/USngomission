Yamhill Community Action Partnership (YCAP), a private nonprofit organization serving residents of Yamhill County since 1980, is one of more than 1,000 community action agencies nationwide. These agencies were created to promote the health, education and general welfare of Americans in need. Our mission is to advocate for and assist persons toward self-sufficiency. YCAP serves many of these low-income residents, such as seniors and those with disabilities who struggle with fixed incomes, as well as individuals and families who are in low-wage positions or seeking employment, survivors of domestic violence, migrant families, homeless families and at-risk youth.
