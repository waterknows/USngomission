Serving our neighbors in need since 1941, the Broome County Council of Churches (BCCC) is an organization that collaborates with many facets of the community to serve people with needs. Through our growing and diverse programs, the Council provides services to the hungry; elderly and lonely; disabled; sick; imprisoned; homeless and poor; and youth of Broome County. We advocate for change and reconciliation, promoting peace, justice, and genuine community across racial, ethnic, gender, socio-economic, and religious lines.
