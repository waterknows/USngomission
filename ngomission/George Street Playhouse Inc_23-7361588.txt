Founded in 1974 by former Rutgers faculty member Eric Krebs, George Street Playhouse started life in a repurposed supermarket on George Street in New Brunswick, NJ. In 1986, the Playhouse moved into its current home. The mission of George Street Playhouse is to enrich people's lives by producing world-class theatre. The Playhouse has been well represented by numerous productions both on and off-Broadway.
