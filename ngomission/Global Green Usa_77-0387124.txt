Founded in 1993, Global Green USA (GG USA) is the American arm of Green Cross International (GCI), which was created by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to foster a global value shift toward a sustainable and secure future by reconnecting humanity with the environment. Global Green is working to address some of the greatest challenges facing humanity. In the United States our work is primarily focused on stemming global climate change by creating green buildings and cities. GG USA's unique approach merges innovative research, cutting-edge community based projects and targeted advocacy. Internationally, Global Green and its affiliates are working toward: eliminating weapons of mass destruction and providing clean, safe drinking water for everyone.
