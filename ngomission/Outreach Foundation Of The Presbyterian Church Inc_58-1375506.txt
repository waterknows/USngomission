The Outreach Foundation seeks to engage Presbyterians in Christ-centered evangelistic mission for the salvation of humankind. Through relationships with missionaries and projects with global partners, we help to create and sustain mission partnerships that build up the body of Christ for God's mission in the U.S. and around the world. We are a validated mission support group of the Presbyterian Church (USA), working in and beyond our denomination to help individuals and congregations participate in the amazing things that God is doing in the world.
