The Thomas Irvine Dodge Nature Center was founded in 1967 by Olivia Irvine Dodge. A pioneer in environmental education, Dodge was one of the first nature centers in the state of Minnesota. Over the past 41 years, Dodge staff has developed an expansive environmental education curriculum delivered to hundreds of thousands of school children in our surrounding communities. Dodge offers a variety of unique experiences for people of all ages. Its many landscapes provide the outdoor classrooms for more than 50 different curriculum topics for visiting school groups, space for exploring preschoolers attending our premier preschool, community education on evenings and weekends, day camp programs for school-aged children, miles of hiking trails and prairie and oak savanna restoration projects.
