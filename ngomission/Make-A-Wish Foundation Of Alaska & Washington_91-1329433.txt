Since 1986, Make-A-Wish® Alaska and Washington has granted wishes to more than 5,600 children with life-threatening medical conditions to enrich the human experience with hope, strength and joy. According to a 2011 U.S. study of wish impact, most health professionals surveyed believe a wish-come-true can influence the health of children. Children say wishes give them renewed strength to fight their illnesses, and their parents say these experiences help strengthen the entire family. Currently, there are more than 400 children awaiting their wishes and there are more who qualify for our services, yet we are unable to reach them and grant their wishes due to a lack of funds and capacity. In fact, every year, one in four seriously-ill children in Alaska and Washington do not receive a wish because of a lack of funding.
