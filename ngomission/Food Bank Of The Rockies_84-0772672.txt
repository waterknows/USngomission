Food Bank of the Rockies (FBR) was founded in 1978 and known as the Colorado Food Clearing House. Operating from a 900 square-foot schoolroom in northwest Denver, the fledgling organization collected food from nearby Safeway stores and distributed it to one needy agency. Today, the Food Bank has extended its reach across northern Colorado and into Wyoming, providing food supplies to more than 1,000 hunger relief programs. Last year, we distributed nearly 25 million pounds of food, enough to provide over 52,000 meals each day to children, seniors and families in need.
