The Channel Islands YMCA provides programs based upon Christian principles to men women and children of all ages, races, religious beliefs and economic status to develop and enrich the spirit, mind, and body. We serve more than 60,000 individuals each year in the Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties. We have been building strong kids, strong families, and strong communities since 1887. Our programs include: aquatics, camps, child care, family activities, health and well-being, sports and recreation, older adult, teen and youth programs, and youth and family services.
