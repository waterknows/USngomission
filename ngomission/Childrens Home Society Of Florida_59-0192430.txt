Established in 1902, Children's Home Society of Florida (CHS) is one of Florida's oldest private nonprofit organizations providing services to children and families. CHS delivers a unique spectrum of social services designed to protect children at risk of abuse, neglect or abandonment; to strengthen and stabilize families; to help young people break the cycle of abuse and neglect; and to find safe, loving homes for children. Last year, CHS helped to improve the lives of more than 90,000 children and family members. Nationally accredited since 1982 by the Council on Accreditation (COA), CHS is headquartered in Winter Park, Fla. Our 14 divisions blanket the state, with nearly 2,000 dedicated, trained staff members delivering child-focused, family-centered care.
