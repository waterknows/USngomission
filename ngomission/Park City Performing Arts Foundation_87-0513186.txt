The Park City Institute seeks to enrich the community by providing innovative experiences that entertain, educate and illuminate. The George S. and Dolores Dor√© Eccles Center for the Performing Arts opened in 1998, and ever since, The Eccles Center has served as a community home for a diverse, world class smorgasbord of artists.
