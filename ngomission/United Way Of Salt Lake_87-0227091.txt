Established in 1904 as the Salt Lake Charity Association, its original mission was to help the poor, discourage panhandling, and coordinate the multiple programs. The historic "community chest" with a broad charitable mission has transformed into an agent for social change focused on Collective Impact--bringing partners together in new and innovative ways to identify problems and develop lasting solutions. United Way of Salt Lake serves individuals and families in Davis, Salt Lake, Summit, and Tooele counties. Our mission is to improve lives and build strong communities by uniting individuals and organizations with the will, passion, expertise, and resources needed to solve problems.
