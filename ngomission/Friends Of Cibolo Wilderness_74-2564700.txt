Open to the public since Earth Day 1990, the Cibolo Nature Center (CNC) provides education, research, entertainment and outdoor activities for more than 100,000 visitors a year, while promoting sound stewardship of land, water and wildlife. The Cibolo Nature Center is 100 acres of Hill Country trails and wilderness. The center and its overseers, The Friends of the Cibolo Wilderness, are dedicated to promoting conservation of natural resources through education and stewardship. The center embraces four distinct ecosystems: riparian forest; live oak savannah, tall-grass prairie and spring-fed marsh.
