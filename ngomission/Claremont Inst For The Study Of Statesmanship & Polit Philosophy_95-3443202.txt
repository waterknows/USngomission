Founded in 1979, The Claremont Institute works to restore the principles of the American Founding to their rightful, preeminent authority in our national life. To recover the founding principles in our political life means recovering a limited and accountable government that respects private property, promotes stable family life, and maintains a strong defense. The Claremont Institute's work is national in scope, but gives special emphasis to the problems of our country's most populous state, California, where the Institute is based. The scholarship and publications of the Claremont Institute extend from strategic to literary studies, from modern economics to classical philosophy - in short, to all those subjects upon which free men must draw to preserve and to perfect their liberty.
