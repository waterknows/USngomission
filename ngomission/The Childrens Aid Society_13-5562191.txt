Founded in 1853, The Children's Aid Society (CAS) works to ensure the physical and emotional well-being of children and families, and to provide each child with the support and opportunities needed to become a happy, healthy and productive adult. CAS fills the gaps between what children deserve and what life has dealt them. We have been serving children for more than 150 years, a longevity that is a testament to our ability to adapt to the always changing needs of today's youth. Today CAS serves more than 150,000 children and their families at more than 45 sites throughout New York City.
