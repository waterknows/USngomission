Chartered in 1934, the Animal Defense League (ADL) is a true no-kill shelter for abandoned, abused, neglected, or surrendered dogs and cats. Our mission is to enhance the quality of life for these animals by providing needed medical care, including spaying and neutering. Food, shelter, safety, and behavioral are also provided, along with compassion and loving attention. While maintaining a healthy and loving facility, ADL consistently works to find the best possible home for each resident animal. The ADL provides programs and services which strengthen the bond between animals and people. Through grass roots advocacy, education, legal intervention, and rescue, the organization is the leading voice for dogs and cats in crisis.
