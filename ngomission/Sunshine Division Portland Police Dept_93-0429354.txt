Since 1923, the Portland Police Bureau Sunshine Division has been providing emergency food and clothing relief to Portland families and individuals in need. Whether due to the loss of a job, domestic crime, illness, or victims of fire or disaster, the Sunshine Division has built an 89-year legacy of mobilizing quickly and efficiently to assist distressed Portlanders. We offer emergency food assistance five days a week at our North Portland warehouse as well as 24/7 through our partnership with the Portland Police Bureau who store food boxes at each police precinct that can be dispatched to people in need at any time. In addition to food relief we also offer new and gently used clothing to those in need at our North Portland facility.
