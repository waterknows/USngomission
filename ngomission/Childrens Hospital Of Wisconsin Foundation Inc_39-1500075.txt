Children's Hospital of Wisconsin Foundation provides philanthropic support to Children's Hospital of Wisconsin and its tax-exempt affiliates. The Foundation has advanced the Hospital's mission by securing endowment funds for a large number of programs and services related to pediatric patient care, education, research and advocacy for children. Our accomplishments include: helping to fund the creation of the Children's Hospital's child protection center and the child life program of education and play therapy for children; significant funding of the hospital's intensive care units' equipment; and funding for school-based health centers in Milwaukee schools.
