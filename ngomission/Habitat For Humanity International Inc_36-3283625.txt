Founded in 1984, Habitat for Humanity of Omaha's mission is to build homes and lives through the partnership of our community's spiritual and material resources. We are a Christian housing organization dedicated to the elimination of substandard housing. Habitat for Humanity of Omaha builds houses in conjunction with families from all cultural backgrounds living in substandard housing. Habitat has built homes for African-American, Caucasian, Latino and Sudanese families in Omaha. We sell the homes to buyers with no interest and no profit and require 350 hours of sweat equity in place of a large down payment.
