Children's Lifeline provides solid Biblical teaching, food, clothing, medical supplies, facilities for educational assistance for the underprivileged children and their families in underdeveloped areas in HAITI. We have many professionals from a wide range of fields that help demonstrate deep wisdom, trustworthiness, and total unselfish giving of themselves in bringing the gospel of Jesus Christ to the people of these lands. Our hope is that the children that are being fed and trained by Children's Lifeline will become the future teachers, preachers and businessmen of Haiti. Lifeline works with a large staff of volunteers from all over the country to make a better life for the people of Haiti.
