The Animal Shelter of Wood River Valley is on a mission to enrich the quality of life in their community by connecting animals and people through innovative programs that inspire and have impact beyond their borders. The first "no kill" shelter in the State of Idaho, they promote companion animal welfare by providing temporary shelter for homeless animals, adopting them to qualified homes and reducing animal abuse, neglect and overpopulation through community education and spay/neuter services. Founded in 1972, the Animal Shelter is funded almost entirely by private donations and grants.
