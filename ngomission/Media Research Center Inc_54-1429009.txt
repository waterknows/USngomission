Founded in 1987, the mission of the Media Research Center (MRC) is to bring balance to the news media. Through the MRC's successful implementation of the largest, most comprehensive media monitoring operation in the world, the MRC serves as the checks and balances on the Fourth Estate. Through its divisions, programs, and a marketing effort that never rests, the Media Research Center has become an institutionalized machine on the issue of balance in the press. The Media Research Center is the only conservative organization that documents, exposes, and neutralizes liberal media bias 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
