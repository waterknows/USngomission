Founded in 1988, Habitat for Humanity of Washington, D.C. (DC Habitat) works to eliminate poverty housing and homelessness in the nation's capital by building affordable, energy- and resource-efficient homes for people in need. DC Habitat sells homes to families who are ineligible for conventional financing, offering no-profit, no-interest, 25 year mortgages to our buyers. Prospective homeowners make a minimal down payment and contribute 300 hours of sweat equity towards construction of their own home.
