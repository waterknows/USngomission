Catholics United for the Faith (CUF) is an international lay apostolate founded in 1968 to support, defend, and advance the efforts of the Teaching Church in accord with the teachings of the Second Vatican Council. The efforts of CUF must be directed toward the unity of the Church and communion with God the Father as intended by Christ. This is accomplished by joining members in a common apostolate to be formed doctrinally and spiritually in the Catholic faith. The desired result is the renewal of their own hearts. This formation also equips members to prayerfully engage in works of evangelization and catechesis for the renewal of the Church and society as lay witnesses to Our Blessed Lord. CUF promotes fidelity to and communion with the Holy Father and the bishops in union with him.
