Peter Deyneka Russian Ministries (PDRM) reaches deep into the nations of the former Soviet Union through its ministry partnerships and in training and equipping Next Generation leaders. Not a traditional missionary sending agency, PDRM helps people in Russia and all of the former Soviet Union to grow and reach deep into their communities. We evangelize, equip and energize Next Generation men and women to become light in darkness and to bring hope to humanly hopeless situations.
