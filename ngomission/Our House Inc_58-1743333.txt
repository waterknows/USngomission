Our House breaks the chains of homelessness by providing quality early childhood education and comprehensive support services for families who are experiencing homelessness. Our House founders envisioned offering homeless parents more than free childcare: they wanted to provide a loving, safe haven where a parent could confidently leave her child while she sought employment and permanent housing. They realized that without reliable childcare, homeless parents, especially single women, were trapped in the cycle of unemployment, poverty and homelessness.
