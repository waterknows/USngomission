Founded in 2003, the mission of Bivona Child Advocacy Center is to coordinate and provide services and support to meet the needs of child victims of sexual or physical abuse and their families at a single, safe child-friendly facility. Bivona advocates on behalf of abused children by reducing trauma, increasing accountability, fostering healing, and promoting education and awareness to the community. Bovina accomplishes this by facilitating a collaboration of professionals who specialize in child abuse. They protect, treat and counsel children and their families so the journey of healing can begin. More than 1,500 children are helped at Bivona each year.
