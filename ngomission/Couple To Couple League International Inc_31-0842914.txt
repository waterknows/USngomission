The Couple to Couple League (CCL) is an international, interfaith organization dedicated to teaching natural family planning (NFP) to married and engaged couples. The Couple to Couple League was founded in 1971 for three purposes: to meet the need for a nationwide, independent, and organized way of delivering NFP services; to provide instruction in NFP that includes moral and religious values along with physiological and scientifically accurate information; and to train volunteer married couples to be proficient counselors and teachers in a 99% effective method of NFP, and at no cost to those who generously undertake this training.
