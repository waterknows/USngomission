The Minneapolis Jewish Federation supports a critical safety net of services and programs to meet the needs of millions of Jews and non-Jews locally, nationally and in 60 countries around the world. Through the Federation Annual Campaign, more than $14.5 million dollars is distributed to more than 50 partner agencies and programs to provide medical assistance, counseling services, meals to homebound seniors, opportunities for children with special needs, job training, quality Jewish education, outreach to immigrant populations, emergency housing assistance and so much more. In addition, the Federation engages in ongoing research and planning to identify and determine how to continue to meet a wide variety of needs in order to maintain our strong and vibrant community.
