Since 1926, Boys & Girls Clubs of Southeastern Michigan (originally the Boys' Club of Detroit) has provided high quality youth development programs, sporting activities, events and a safe haven for children from all walks of life. In addition, the Clubs have been credited with saving lives of children who often have no one to turn to in times of family problems, poverty, failing grades and other difficult situations. The Clubs - directors, professional staff and volunteers - are here to help children ages 6-18 (grades 1-12) grow into responsible, self-reliant and caring individuals.
