Fan Free Clinic (FFC) provides medical treatment, health education, social services and advocacy for those in the Richmond area with limited access to care, placing special emphasis on welcoming the least served. In 1968, a small community clinic was established in Richmond's historic Fan District. Incorporated two years later, Fan Free Clinic became the first free clinic in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Over the years, FFC's focus has shifted with the needs of the community. Today, as more and more individuals and families find themselves without adequate health care coverage and affordable resources, FFC is reshaping itself once again to meet contemporary challenges.
