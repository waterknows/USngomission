The Chapin School, founded in 1901 by Maria Bowen Chapin, is an independent day school dedicated to the intellectual and personal growth of young women. Students engage in a rigorous liberal arts program that prepares them for further academic study and fosters curiosity, creativity, enthusiasm and integrity. The school provides a balance between freedom and structure, independence and support, individualism and cooperation, and innovation and tradition. The Chapin School is committed to preparing young women to thrive and lead in an increasingly complex world through the pursuit of academic excellence, personal integrity, and community responsibility. Chapin currently has 673 students enrolled in kindergarten through twelfth grade.
