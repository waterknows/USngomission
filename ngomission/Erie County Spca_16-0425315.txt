The second-oldest humane society in the country, the SPCA Serving Erie County opened its doors in February of 1867. The mission of the SPCA Serving Erie County is to create a caring and kind community that encourages fair and humane treatment of all creatures. Our knowledgeable, caring, and open-minded team of staff and volunteers achieves that mission through proactive efforts to address the current status of animals in our community, education of adults and children, rescue and sheltering of animals in need, and placement of animals into appropriate homes. By providing services for people and animals, we empower individuals to become caring, competent, responsible citizens who value animals as a vital part of our community.
