Through a network of 275 community based organizations, including food pantries and soup kitchens, the Food Bank has provided food assistance to 49,000 people each week, including low-income and working poor adults, children, and the elderly, since 1985. In addition to food distribution, the Food Bank educates the community about the causes of hunger and poverty, advocates for policies to address the root causes of poverty and operates an emergency food referral hotline.
