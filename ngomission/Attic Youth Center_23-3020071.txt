The Attic Youth Center creates opportunities for LGBTQ youth to develop into healthy, independent, civic-minded adults within a safe and supportive community, and promotes the acceptance of LGBTQ youth in society. From what was once a weekly support group, The Attic has grown into a nationally recognized, multi-service youth organization, and is now one of the largest community centers in the U.S. committed exclusively to serving LGBTQ youth and allies.
