Founded in 1987, Youth Frontiers (YF) is an organization built on the idea of fostering safe, positive school communities where students and educators can thrive emotionally, socially and, therefore, academically. Youth Frontiers offers retreat programs for students from fourth through 12th grade. These interactive programs are designed to have the greatest possible impact and function as a catalyst for getting students to care about character. The retreats are developmentally appropriate for each age group and take into account what stressors and issues kids may be facing at school. Comprehensive follow-up materials are customized for each age level to remind students of the themes they learned on their retreat, while challenging them to continue to stand up for respect in their schools.
