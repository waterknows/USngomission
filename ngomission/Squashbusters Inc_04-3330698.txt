SquashBusters is a sports-based after-school youth enrichment program located in Boston and Lawrence, Massachusetts. We use the sport of squash, in combination with academic enrichment / homework tutoring, community service, school counseling and placement, and summer opportunities to improve the lives of Boston and Lawrence youth. SquashBusters has served more than 500 young people since its 1996 inception. SquashBusters' Mission is to challenge and nurture urban youth- as students, athletes and citizens- so that they recognize and fulfill their fullest potential in life. SquashBusters aims to ensure that all its students graduate from high school, and matriculate to and graduate from college. By doing so, its students grow to become healthy, civic-minded, educated adults.
