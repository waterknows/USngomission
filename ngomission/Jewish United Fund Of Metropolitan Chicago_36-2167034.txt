The Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago (JUF) is the central address of Chicago's Jewish community, mobilizing the critical resources that bring food, refuge, health care, education and emergency assistance to 300,000 Chicagoans of all faiths and two million Jews around the world. JUF funds a network of nearly 70 agencies and programs that care for people at every stage of life, regardless of the ability to pay. Since 1900, JUF has worked to give voice to the community, and to assure that necessities are provided for its most vulnerable members - children, immigrants, the poor, the elderly and the disabled.
