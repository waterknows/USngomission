The Milwaukee Art Museum (MAM) collects and preserves art, presenting it to the community as a vital source of inspiration and education. Central to the Museum's mission is its role as a premier educational resource, with educational programs that are among the largest in the nation, involving classes, tours, and a full calendar of events for all ages. From its roots in Milwaukee's first art gallery in 1888, the Museum has grown today to be an icon for Milwaukee and a resource for the entire state. Four floors of over forty galleries of art are rotated regularly with works from antiquity to the present in the Museum's far-reaching collection. Included in the Collection are 15th- to 20th-century European and 17th- to 20th-century American paintings, sculpture, prints, drawings, decorative arts, photographs, and folk and self-taught art.
