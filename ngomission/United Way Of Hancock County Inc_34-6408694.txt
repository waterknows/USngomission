The mission of United Way of Hancock County is to "measurably improve people's lives." Our work is based on the provision of safety net services to meet crisis needs while also working on long-term solutions in the areas of education, income, and health. These are the building blocks for a good life--a quality education that leads to a stable job, enough income to support a family through retirement, and good health and well-being for a more productive life.
