Since 1929, The Seeing Eye has partnered with people who are blind who seek to enhance their independence, dignity, and self-confidence through the use of Seeing Eye dogs. About 14,000 of these specially bred and trained dogs have brought a new level of mobility, safety, and self-sufficiency to almost 8,000 men and women. Our students - people who are blind or visually impaired - come from all over the United States and Canada to spend up to a month training with a new Seeing Eye dog.
