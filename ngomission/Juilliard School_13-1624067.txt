Since opening in October 1905 as the Institute of Musical Art, Juilliard has established this country's standard for arts education. The mission of The Juilliard School is to provide the highest caliber of artistic education for gifted musicians, dancers, and actors from around the world, so that they may achieve their fullest potential as artists, leaders, and global citizens. There are approximately 800 students-undergraduate and graduate-in our three divisions: more than 600 in music (including our newest program, Jazz Studies); 90 dance, and 90 drama. A truly international school, our students come from every state and from nearly 50 foreign countries, as nearby as Canada and as far away as China and Australia.
