The Earth Conservation Corps empowers our endangered youth to reclaim the Anacostia River, their communities and their lives. Engaging the strong minds and muscles of disconnected youth in leading thousands in riparian restoration and  standards-based STEM wildlife research arms them with transferrable job skills. Many gain full time employment in natural resource fields and several have become significant conservation leaders. Indeed, while inspiring our Nations Capitol to join them in their cause the young volunteers of the Earth Conservation Corps have shown the world that love of nature and of national service knows no racial or economic barriers.
