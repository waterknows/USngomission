For more than 40 years the Northeastern Pennsylvania Philharmonic has been respected and treasured as one of our region's leading cultural organizations. Our Philharmonic is a fully professional symphony orchestra, one that has gained national reputation for excellence. And how fortunate we are to have as our Maestro and Music Director, Lawrence Loh, one of the most talented young conductors in the United States! The NEPA Philharmonic's mission is to present live symphonic performances and music education at the highest level of artistic excellence, enriching, and engaging the people of our region. In addition to classic, pops and holiday concerts in Scranton and Wilkes-Barre, there is a chamber music series in both cities. There are also educational concerts, including our Young Peoples Concerts, Crescendo Family Concerts, Music In Our Schools (ensembles that present programs in local schools), and our Kids in the Balcony program. To top it off, we also have our immensely popular FREE July 3 and 4 concerts!
