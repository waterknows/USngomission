Girl Scouts' mission is to build girls of courage, confidence, and character who make the world a better place. Girl Scouting was founded in Houston in 1922 by Corinne Fonde and Frances Mann Law, only 10 years after Juliette Gordon Low established Girl Scouts of the USA (GSUSA) in Savannah, Georgia. Nationwide, more than 2.8 million girls and adults are Girl Scouts today, and Girl Scouts of San Jacinto Council has the largest girl membership in Texas. GSSJC reached over 61,000 girls in the 2014-2015 program year from 26 counties stretching east to the Louisiana border, north to Nacogdoches, west to Katy, and south to Matagorda. Membership is open to anyone who embraces the Girl Scout Promise and Law. Over 30 percent of the Council's membership consists of at-risk girls living in underserved areas. A primary goal of the Council is to build a membership base that represents the diverse communities we serve.
