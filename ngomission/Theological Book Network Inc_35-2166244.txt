The Theological Book Network is committed to the creation and development of Majority World leaders by providing access to educational resources from the West and by assisting in the production and dissemination of local resources, contributing to the practice of theological reflection on the needs and goals of the Majority World church. We seek to see well-stocked libraries at seminaries, universities, and Bible colleges so that faculty and students may access the books and journals they need for academic and spiritual growth. We work in partnership with publishers, theological libraries, scholars and clergy to provide top-notch theological resources to schools in the Global South.
