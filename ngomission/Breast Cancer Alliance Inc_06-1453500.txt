The mission of the Breast Cancer Alliance is to improve survival rates and quality of life for those impacted by breast cancer through better prevention, early detection, treatment and cure. To promote these goals, we invest in innovative research, breast surgery fellowships, regional education, dignified support and screening for the uninsured and underserved. Founded in March 1996 by Mary Waterman, have awarded over $17 million in grants since our founding.
