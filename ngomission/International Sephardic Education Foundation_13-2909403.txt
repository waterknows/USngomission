The mission of the ISEF Foundation (International Sephardic Education Foundation) is to build a better Israel by expanding access to higher education for bright young Israelis from immigrant and underserved communities. ISEF believes Israel's greatest natural resource is the minds of its youth, and investing in their development is vital for Israel's security and prosperity. ISEF supports over 600 deserving young Israelis pursuing degrees from BA to PhD at 21 Israeli universities and colleges, alongside 39 ISEF International Fellows engaged in PhD and postdoctoral training at top international research universities. As part of their leadership training, ISEF's scholars tutor and mentor some 1,000 promising Israeli youngsters in low-income areas, bolstering critical academic skills and offering living examples of the power of education to break the cycle of poverty.
