WiLDCOAST protects and preserves coastal ecosystems and wildlife in the Californias and Latin America by building grassroots support, conducting media campaigns and establishing protected areas. WiLDCOAST was founded in 2000 in order to protect some of the most ecologically important coastal wildlands, islands and marine areas that remain in California and Baja California. Since its inception, WiLDCOAST has successfully protected more than one million acres of coastal wildlands and halted the development plans of illegal mega-resorts throughout the Baja California Peninsula and the Sea of Cortez. Through its innovative conservation campaigns, WiLDCOAST has brought critical attention to pressing environmental issues in the Californias.
