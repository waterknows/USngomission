United Way of Greater Baytown Area & Chambers County was chartered in 1946 as the Tri-Cities and East Harris Community Chest after World War II ended. We develop, promote and support solutions to meet targeted community needs. Dollars given here stay in our community to serve families and individuals in Baytown, Highlands and Chambers County.
