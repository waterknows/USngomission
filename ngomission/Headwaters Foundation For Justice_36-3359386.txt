Headwaters Foundation for Justice is a catalyst for social, racial, economic and environmental justice. All Minnesotans deserve the chance to both contribute to and benefit from the state's environmental, economic, social and civic resources. We believe community organizing is the best way to make this vision a reality. Through grantmaking and organizational assistance, Headwaters supports grassroots groups addressing the root causes of injustice. Headwaters engages and partners with a committed community of donors and allies who work for justice.
