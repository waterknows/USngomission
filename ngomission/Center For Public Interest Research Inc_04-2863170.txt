The Center for Public Interest Research engages in research and education and assists public interest organizations engaged in similar activities. The Center works with various state public interest research groups (PIRG's) to support development of the consumer protection movement through coordinated research, report writing, coalition building, citizen outreach and public education. In addition, we work with state PIRG's on a range of environmental and other public interest programs including educating the public and decision makers on issues such as a right to know, preservation of the environment, and protection of clean air and clean water.
