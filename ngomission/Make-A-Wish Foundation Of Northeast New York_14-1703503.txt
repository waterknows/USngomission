Make-A-Wish grants the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions to enrich the human experience with hope, strength, and joy. Make-A-Wish Northeast New York was incorporated in 1987 and currently serves the 15 counties that comprise the 518 area code. We currently have a network of over 250 volunteers who help grant the wishes of children with a life-threatening medical condition. The chapter grants nearly 100 wishes each year and has granted more than 1,400 wishes since it was founded.
