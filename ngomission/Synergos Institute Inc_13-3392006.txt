Founded in 1986, Synergos addresses global poverty and social injustice through a process of collaboration. Bringing together the most influential people and institutions in government, business and civil society, as well as poor and marginalized communities who are usually left out of the process, we help every part of society work together to create long-term progress. In over 20 years, Synergos has supported innovative global partnerships in more than 30 countries and regions. To promote and support these systems-changing collaborations, our networks help leaders and leading institutions learn from each other and access the ideas, people and resources that can help them make a greater impact in addressing issues of poverty, equity and social justice. In addition, we share the knowledge learned through our work so others can benefit from our experience.
