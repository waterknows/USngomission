Founded in 1971, Life Action Revival Ministries is on a mission. We have a single-minded focus to see God glorified through a revival among His people. This purpose has carried us for over three decades of work alongside the churches of our nation. Life Action Ministries is the largest revival ministry in North America. The staff has grown from one to over 200 dedicated workers in 25 different departments. Though our founder passed away in 1989, his legacy lives on today in Life Action's revival summits; Revive Our Hearts; The Lodge in Southwest Michigan; our Collegiate Impact division; and the Life Action Camp.
