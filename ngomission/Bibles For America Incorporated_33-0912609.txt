Founded in 2000, Bibles for America's heart is to help you know God and understand the Bible in a deeper way, so we give away free copies of the New Testament Recovery Version and Christian books by Watchman Nee and Witness Lee. This study Bible and the works of these Christian authors have revolutionized our Christian lives, and we want to share them with everyone we meet. We're always looking for new ways to get Bibles and books into the hands of the people in this country.
