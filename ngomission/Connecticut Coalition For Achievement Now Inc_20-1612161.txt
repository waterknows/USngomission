ConnCAN, the Connecticut Coalition for Achievement Now, is leading a movement to improve education outcomes for Connecticut's kids. We bring advocates, policy makers, parents and educators together to change the system and give all kids access to the great public schools they deserve. ConnCAN's focus issues include: protecting progress on landmark education reforms; increasing access to high quality public school options; finding and supporting great teachers and principals; turning around chronically failing schools; developing a fairer funding system for every student; and providing accountability and transparency.
