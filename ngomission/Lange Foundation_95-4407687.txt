Founded in 1993 by Gillian Lange, Lange Foundation is dedicated to saving impounded companion animals, and preparing them for a journey to a new, safe, loving world. In 2004, Lange Foundation initiated a County-wide sterilization program. We provide funding for spay and neuter to those pet guardians who are unable to afford the cost of surgery. We provide easy access for the pet guardian by sending them a voucher to a Veterinarian whose practice is near their home. Feral cats are also included in this program, and we are proponents of the TNR policy (trap, neuter, return). We believe this is the only way to make Los Angeles a No-Kill County, and provide service to 10,000 pets.
