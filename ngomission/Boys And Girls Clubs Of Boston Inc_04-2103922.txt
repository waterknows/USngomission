Founded in 1893, Boys & Girls Clubs of Boston (BGCB) works to help young people, especially those who need us most, build strong character and realize their full potential as responsible citizens and leaders. We do this by providing: a safe haven filled with hope and opportunity, ongoing relationships with caring adults, and life-enhancing programs. BGCB annually serves more than 14,000 young people, ages 6-18, in 10 Clubs, at Camp Harbor View, and through YouthConnect, our program in partnership with the Boston Police Department. The agency's core programs focus on education; technology; the arts; sports, fitness and recreation; life skills and leadership development. BGCB is an affiliate of Boys & Girls Clubs of America and The United Way of Massachusetts Bay and Merrimack Valley.
