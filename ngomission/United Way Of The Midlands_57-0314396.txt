Founded in 1887, the mission of United Way of the Midlands is simple: we unite people and resources to improve the quality of life in the Midlands. We work to determine and respond to the critical human service needs of the community, and this work is achieved by a four-part process: Determining community needs, Prioritizing community needs, Developing community resources, and Distributing community resources. United Way of the Midlands covers the counties of Richland, Lexington, Fairfield, Newberry, Calhoun, and Orangeburg.
