The Moffitt Cancer Center Foundation was founded in 1994 with the sole purpose of supporting the three major areas of concentration at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute - cancer research, patient care and education. The mission of the Cancer Center is to contribute to the prevention and cure of cancer. As part of an elite group of National Cancer Institute (NCI) Comprehensive Cancer Centers, Moffitt focuses on the development of early stage translational research aimed at the rapid translation of scientific discoveries to benefit patient care.
