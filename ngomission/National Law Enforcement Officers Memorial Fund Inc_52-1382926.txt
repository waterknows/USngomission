The mission of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund is to generate increased public support for the law enforcement profession by permanently recording and appropriately commemorating the service and sacrifice of law enforcement officers; and to provide information that will help promote law enforcement safety. The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund has built the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, which is visited by more than 200,000 people annually. In addition the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund has successfully lobbied for a federal law requiring all American flags to be lowered to half-staff on Peace Officers Memorial Day (May 15th).
