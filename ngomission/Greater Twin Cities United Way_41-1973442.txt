Greater Twin Cities United Way (GTCUW) was created in 2001 by the merger of the United Ways of Minneapolis and St. Paul. Greater Twin Cities United Way unites caring people in building stronger communities by inspiring people to help others, increasing resources to meet needs and fostering innovative solutions to problems. United Way believes that poverty is our community's most critical issue, affecting our quality of life today and in the future. In response, we have narrowed our focus to address poverty and its underlying issues. Our three focus areas are: meeting basic needs, supporting health and independence, and nurturing children and families.
