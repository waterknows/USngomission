Sunday Breakfast Mission serves the homeless, addicted and impoverished through Christ-centered programs to meet their spiritual, social and physical needs. Our primary goal is to restore people to right relationship with God, their families and society. We Shelter for more than 280 homeless men, women, and children nightly. We also offer long-term substance abuse programming for 90 homeless and addicted men and women. In 2001 we provided hungry men, women, and children over 319,000 nutritious meals and provided over 59,000 nights of safe shelter for people who would otherwise be sleeping in alleys, abandoned buildings, cars, or other dangerous and inhospitable places.
