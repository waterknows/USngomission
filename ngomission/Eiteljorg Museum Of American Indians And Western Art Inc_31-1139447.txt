The Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art, which opened in 1989, is the only museum of its kind in the Midwest, and one of only two museums east of the Mississippi that showcase both Native American and Western art, culture and history. The mission of the Eiteljorg Museum is to inspire an appreciation and understanding of the art, history and cultures of the American West and the indigenous peoples of North America. The Eiteljorg Museum collects and preserves Western art and Native American art and cultural objects of the highest quality, and serves the public through engaging exhibitions, educational programs, cultural exchanges and entertaining special events.
