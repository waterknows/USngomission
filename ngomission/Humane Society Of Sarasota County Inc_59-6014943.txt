The Humane Society of Sarasota County's (HSSC) mission is to provide abandoned pets with compassionate care and shelter while promoting responsible pet ownership and securing permanent homes. Programs offered include pet adoptions, humane education, pet therapy, a pet pantry and a volunteer program. HSSC shelters over 1,500 pets each year. Believing that the best place for pets is in the home, it also offers canine obedience classes and information/ resources to pet owners seeking alternatives to abandonment.
