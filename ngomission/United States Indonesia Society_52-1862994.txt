The United States-Indonesia Society (USINDO) was founded in 1994 by Indonesians and Americans who had experience in both countries and who agreed on the need for an organization to focus on expanding mutual understanding. The mission of USINDO is to expand mutual understanding in the areas of politics, economics, history, culture, and to strengthen the bilateral relationship. We promote this mission through work with leaders in government and nongovernmental organizations, educators, the media, business, and the general public. We provide timely and accurate information through lectures, conferences and discussions, and promote education through scholarships, travel grants and educational projects in Indonesia, including forging new linkages between U.S. and Indonesian universities.
