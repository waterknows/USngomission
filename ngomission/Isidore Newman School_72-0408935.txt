Founded in 1903, Isidore Newman School is a co-educational independent school, serving pre-kindergarten through 12th grade, where students are valued individually, engaged academically, and taught to be socially responsible. Newman is the only co-educational, non-sectarian, independent day school in the city of New Orleans. The School prides itself on reaching out to the community, through Breakthrough New Orleans, a free program that prepares area students for independent schools; through STARS, where our lower school students share science labs with area students, and through a wide variety of community service activities happening throughout the school year in all divisions.
