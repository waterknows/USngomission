The Science Center of Iowa (SCI) is a center devoted to lifelong learning featuring six dynamic experience platforms and where visitors can explore and experiment. By placing the power of learning in the hands of the visitor, the programmatic emphasis is not on what to learn, but how to learn. SCI strives to be the highest quality resource inspiring scientific exploration through interactive education, exhibits, and programs. Our goal is to be a quality community resource for informal science learning where children, families, school groups and individuals come to explore science and technology. SCI also showcases a 216-seat Blank IMAX Dome Theater, a 175-seat John Deere Adventure Theater featuring live performances, and a 50 foot domed Star Theater.
