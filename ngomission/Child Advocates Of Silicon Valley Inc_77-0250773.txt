Child Advocates of Silicon Valley provides stability and hope to abused children by being a powerful voice in their lives. By matching trained volunteers (Advocates) with dependent children, we ensure the needs and best interests of foster children in our program are met. Because our volunteers are court-appointed, they can thoroughly research every aspect of a child's case, including meeting teachers, social workers and foster parents. Advocates provide reports to the court so judges can make decisions with clear and accurate information. In addition to representing children in court, Advocates serve as friends and mentors.
