Founded in May 1998, the Cat Adoption Team (CAT) is the Pacific Northwest's largest limited admission/adoption guarantee cat shelter. CAT's mission is to work with the community to save the lives of unwanted, homeless, sick, and injured cats and kittens by offering shelter, adoption, foster, low-cost spay/neuter, and veterinary services to end needless feline euthanasia. CAT takes in and finds homes for approximately 2,500 cats and kittens each year; provides subsidized spay/neuter surgeries for approximately 1,500 publicly-owned cats (and spays/neuters all CAT cats and kittens prior to adoption); and provides information and resources to cat owners throughout the Portland Metro region and beyond. In 2015, CAT found a home for its 35,000th cat. CAT is a founding partner of the Animal Shelter Alliance of Portland; working together, ASAP partners have increased the save rate for cats and kittens throughout the Portland Metro area from 49% to 91% in 8 years.
