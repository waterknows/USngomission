The New York Women's Foundation (NYWF) was established in 1987 to be a voice for women and a force for change. NYWF is a cross-cultural alliance of women helping low-income women and girls in New York City's five boroughs to achieve sustained economic security through expanded opportunities. We pursue our mission by: providing financial support to projects led by women which seek to overcome fundamental barriers faced by women and girls; offering critical leadership to promote effective public policy and responsible philanthropic giving to benefit low-income women and girls; and promoting leadership and alliances among women and girls that offer opportunities for individual, organizational, and community development.
