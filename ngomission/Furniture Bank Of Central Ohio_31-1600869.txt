Founded in 1998, the mission of the Furniture Bank of Central Ohio is to provide free furniture to central Ohio families and individuals struggling with poverty and other severe life challenges. Our Vision is for all central Ohio families to live in furnished homes, thereby relieving suffering, strengthening family units, improving quality of life and building a better community. Community collaborations and resource sharing make this possible on an ongoing basis.
