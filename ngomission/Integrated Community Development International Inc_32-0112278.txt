Water for Good works collaboratively, in long-term partnership, with communities in central Africa, empowering people with sustainable access to clean water, transformational sanitation principles, and improved agricultural resources. Water for Good accomplishes all projects with trained Central African staff. We are committed to making a lasting impact in the Central African Republic (CAR). We hire, train, and learn from our Central African staff. Their leadership and commitment to this work ensures that it will be sustainable. Water for Good is committed to working at the local, community level. We continually meet with the villages and work with them to plan ways to improve their lives.
