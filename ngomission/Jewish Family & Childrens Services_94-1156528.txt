Jewish Family and Children's Services is one of the oldest and largest family service institutions in the United States, founded in 1850 by immigrant pioneers who arrived in California during the Gold Rush and created an extended family to care for each other.Today, we continue to be that extended family, serving 78,000 people annually with the highest quality, research-based social services designed to strengthen individuals, strengthen families, and strengthen community.As the problem-solving center for residents of San Francisco, Marin, Sonoma, Santa Clara, and San Mateo counties, we are a lifeline for children, families, and older adults facing life transitions and personal crises.We are grateful to the many generous donors, businesses, and foundations that enable us to continue our humanitarian work.
