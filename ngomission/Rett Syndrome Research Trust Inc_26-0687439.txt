The Rett Syndrome Research Trust is a non-profit exclusively devoted to global research on Rett Syndrome and related MECP2 disorders. Our goal is to heal children and adults who will otherwise suffer the effects of these disorders for the rest of their lives. Since 2008 over $20 million has been awarded to research including funding of two clinical trials. 96% of every dollar raised is channeled directly to our research program.
