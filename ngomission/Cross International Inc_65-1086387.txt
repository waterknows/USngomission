Cross International was born out of the vision of two ministries with a heart for the poor - Christian Children's Charity and the Kielar Family Foundation. Projects include relief for earthquake, flood and tsunami victims, care and education for orphans and other vulnerable children, housing for the homeless, medicines and health care for the indigent, food for families suffering extreme malnutrition, and clean water for communities that have none, as well as micro-enterprise programs and other long-term development efforts to break the cycle of poverty. In every case, our method of outreach is the same: Cross International locates needy church-based ministries serving the poor and distributes material aid through their existing programs. In this way, we can supply meaningful help where it is needed most.
