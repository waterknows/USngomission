Community Works strives to strengthen lives and our community by responding to survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault, and high-need youth and their families, through support services and advocacy. Founded in 1996, we help people move forward using their own strengths in a productive and positive way. Through key community collaborations, a highly engaged board of directors, and deeply committed staff, we offer a comprehensive array of services that address the whole person and family.
