Founded in 2000, Healthcare for the Homeless - Houston's mission is to promote health, hope and dignity for Houston's homeless through accessible and comprehensive care. Healthcare for the Homeless - Houston serves a vulnerable and marginalized population of homeless men, women and children. A sub-population served by the organization includes homeless mentally ill individuals incarcerated in the Harris County Jail. Our purpose is to provide long-term care for those who are unable to navigate a larger system of care; provide interim care for those who can transition into the public healthcare system; and provide medical street outreach to those who live on the streets and in single-night shelters.
