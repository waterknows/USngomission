The mission of Theatre for a New Audience (TFANA) is to help develop and vitalize the performance and study of Shakespeare and classic drama. Founded in 1979 by Jeffrey Horowitz, TFANA produces for audiences Off-Broadway and has also toured nationally and internationally. TFANA finds the contemporary heart of the classics. A reverence for language, spirit of adventure and visual boldness, which supports the work of the writer and actor, mark TFANA's productions. TFANA aspires to a civic role, bonding the diverse community of New York to the language, pleasures and issues of classical drama. At a time when audiences are segmented by economics and diverse cultural backgrounds, TFANA is committed to enhanced education and public access.
