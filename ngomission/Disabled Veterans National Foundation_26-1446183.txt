Founded in 2007, the Disabled Veterans National Foundation exists to ​provide critically needed​ support ​to disabled and at-risk veterans who leave the military wounded—physically or psychologically—after defending our safety and our freedom. We achieve this mission by offering direct financial support to veteran organizations that address the unique needs of veterans, and whose missions align with that of DVNF. We provide supplemental assistance to homeless and low-income veterans through the Health & Comfort program and various empowerment resources. We provide an online resource database that allows veterans to navigate the complex process of seeking benefits that they are entitled to as a result of their military service, as well as additional resources they need. We serve as a thought leader ​on ​critical policy issues within the veteran community, and educating the public accordingly.
