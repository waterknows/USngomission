The Boys & Girls Club of Hollywood has been providing academic enrichment programs to underprivileged students since its founding in 1937. We offer a broad array of academic, health, artistic, and leadership programs for our students at our main facility, as well as after school programs at West Hollywood and Van Ness elementary schools. Our programs all further our mission, which is to "inspire and empower young people, especially those who need us most, to realize their full potential as productive, responsible, and caring adults." We serve over 1,400 students in Los Angeles from predominantly low-income families by providing them with quality youth development programs that also help keep them sheltered, safe, fed, and supervised, away from gangs, crime, drugs, and other risky behaviors. Our five core program areas: Education and Career Development; Character and Leadership Development; Health and Life Skills; The Arts; and Athletics, Social Recreation, and Fitness.
