The Citizens Foundation, USA (TCF-USA) is a professionally managed tax-exempt charity, with a support network of volunteer chapters across the USA. Our mission is to support the building of civil society in Pakistan by providing quality education to underprivileged children, promoting gender equality and advocating for reform of public education. We believe that education is a basic human right, a pre-requisite for democratic institutions to flourish in Pakistan and for its people to compete in a global economy. TCF currently has 1,060 schools in all four provinces of Pakistan with 165,000 children enrolled - nearly half of them girls. We are present in 109 towns and cities. TCF has also trained and employed 8,900 women as teachers and principals.
