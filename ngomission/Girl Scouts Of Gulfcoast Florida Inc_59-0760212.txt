Founded in 1925, Girl Scouts of Gulfcoast Florida has been a driving force in the lives of thousands of girls. As the preeminent organization dedicated solely to girls, we are proud to offer an accepting and nurturing environment where girls ages 5-17 build the character and skills needed for success in the real world. Girl Scouting helps girls discover who they are, connect with others locally and globally, and take action to make the world a better place. With a network of more than 3,000 committed volunteers and more than 40 qualified staff members, girls develop qualities that will serve them all their lives, such as leadership, strong values, social conscience, and conviction about their own potential and self-worth.
