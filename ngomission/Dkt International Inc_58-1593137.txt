Since 1989, the nonprofit organization DKT International has been promoting family planning and HIV/AIDS prevention through social marketing in the developing world. Today, DKT has programs in 18 countries in Latin America, Africa, and Asia. With 22 million CYPs (couple years of protection) in 2010, DKT is the largest private provider of contraceptives and family planning services in the developing world. This 22-million figure represents 11 percent of all couples using modern contraceptive methods in the developing world, minus China. DKT's cost per CYP -- under $2 -- is the lowest of any major social marketing family planning organization in the world. DKT's contraceptive social marketing programs have been a remarkable success. Every year, DKT's innovative programs are saving more lives and improving the health of more families in the developing world.
