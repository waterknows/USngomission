Founded in 1924, the Houston SPCA is Houston's first and largest animal protection organization and shelter. Our mission is to promote commitment to and respect for all animals and free them from suffering, abuse and exploitation, and our vision is that we will lead our community to appreciate the value of animals. Committed to all animals, the Houston SPCA provides quality, humane care to dogs and cats, rabbits and other small mammals, birds, horses, farm animals and more. We also facilitate the protection and rehabilitation of injured, ill, orphaned and oiled native wildlife through our affiliate, Wildlife Rehab & Education. We are also the only shelter in the Greater Gulf Coast area with the ability to provide humane, temporary shelter to big cats and other exotic animals. All programs offered by the Houston SPCA-excluding adoptions, pet-training classes and Critter Camp-are free of charge, a service to our community and its animals, and we place 100% of our adoptable animals.
