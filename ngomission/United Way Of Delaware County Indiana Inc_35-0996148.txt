Since 1925, United Way of Delaware County has given people in Delaware County, Indiana ways to improve lives in our community. Today, the best way to make the biggest possible impact is to first focus on areas that change people's lives forever: preparing kids to enter school ready, and to graduate and succeed, helping families leave poverty permanently by becoming financially stable and independent, and enabling people to live healthy, responsible lives. We engage the community to improve lives by focusing resources on education, health, income.
