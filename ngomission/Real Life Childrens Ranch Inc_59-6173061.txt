Founded in 1957, Real Life Children's Ranch exists to provide a Christian residential group home that cares for boys and girls who have been abused, abandoned, and/or neglected. The children typically range in age from five to seventeen. Our goal is to give children the best possible care in a secure family atmosphere and to guide them into fulfilling and productive futures. Real Life Children's Ranch is a loving, caring environment where the children learn the richness of a well-rounded life. We have four beautifully constructed homes, each housing up to six foster children, the staff and their children. Furthermore, Real Life Children's Ranch is one of the few places in the state designed to care for sibling groups.
