Founded in 1969, Project FIND is dedicated to helping older adults on Manhattan's West Side to live more vital and independent lives in the community. Many of the men and women who live in our three supportive housing residences or come to our five senior centers are healthy and active, but may need greater access to social and recreational activities. Others may need a little more help. For the healthy and active seniors, the homeless, and the significant number of frail, poor, elderly people we serve, Project FIND is a true lifeline, providing housing, meals, and a broad array of activities that help older adults cope with the challenges of aging by encouraging healthy living, socialization, hope and optimism.
