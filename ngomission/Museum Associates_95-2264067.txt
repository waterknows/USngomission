Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) was established in 1910 as part of the Los Angeles Museum of History, Science, and Art. LACMA's collections encompass the geographic world and virtually the entire history of art. Among the museum's special strengths are its holdings of Asian art, Latin American art, and Islamic art, of which LACMA hosts one of the most significant collections in the world. LACMA's mission is to serve the public through the collection, conservation, exhibition, and interpretation of significant works of art from a broad range of cultures and historical periods, and through the translation of these collections into meaningful educational, aesthetic, intellectual, and cultural experiences for the widest array of audiences.
