The Agency for Jewish Learning (AJL) partners with synagogues, schools, early childhood centers, youth groups, Jewish agencies and community organizations, and works with families, and individuals across our region to nurture a vibrant and engaged Jewish community. AJL helps Jewish institutions understand and meet the needs of learners with a broad spectrum of methods and programs. We address experiential education, family education, informal education and differentiation.
