Founded in 1852, Tufts University seeks to lead the way in defining what it means to be a university whose education and research have a global reach. Our students and faculty are engaged in international research and scholarship on issues ranging from AIDS to arsenic. They are grappling with the fundamental human forces that fuel conflict and cooperation in international affairs. And they are doing so through experiential global learning, distinctive interdisciplinary programs that apply academic knowledge to real-life situations around the world. Tufts University's emphasis on international education and research reaches across the curriculum, and infuses every school.
