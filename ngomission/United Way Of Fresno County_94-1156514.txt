United Way of Fresno County brings resources together to address the most urgent issues the community faces. Through unique partnerships and approaches, UWFC mobilizes resources beyond the dollars that are pledged through their fund-raising efforts. Community partners often include schools, government policy makers, businesses, organized labor, financial institutions, voluntary and neighborhood associations, community development corporations, and the faith community.
