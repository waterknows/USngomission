Founded in 1990, the Oshkosh Area Humane Society is an animal welfare organization that operates the Oshkosh Animal Shelter. We are dedicated to providing shelter and care to stray, unwanted or abandoned cats and dogs in the Oshkosh area. Founded on the principal of compassionate care, the organization is committed to assisting the community by helping place animals in healthy, humane surroundings while providing education and information about responsible pet ownership to all the members of our community. Each year approximately 2,000 stray or unwanted animals come through our doors and more than 40,000 people turn to us for assistance with animal-related questions and concerns.
