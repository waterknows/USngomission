MasterVoices is a New York City-based performing arts organization that celebrates singing and the art of musical storytelling. Founded as The Collegiate Chorale almost 75 years ago by legendary conductor Robert Shaw, the organization is one of the jewels of NYC cultural institutions, and has achieved international acclaim as well. On the eve of our 75th Anniversary, we take the new name MasterVoices to better represent who we are: the combined voices of singing artists, both professional and avocational, with those of composers, librettists, designers and directors, to provide masterful performances of music in many genres.
