Founded in 1983, the New York Pops is the largest independent pops orchestra in the United States, and the only professional symphonic orchestra in New York City specializing in popular music. Led by Music Director Steven Reineke, the orchestra performs an annual subscription series at Carnegie Hall, enjoying one of their highest subscription renewal rates. The New York Pops' annual birthday gala is celebrated each spring, raising funds for the orchestra and its education programs.
