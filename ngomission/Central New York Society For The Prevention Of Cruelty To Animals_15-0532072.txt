The Central New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals provides many services for the animals in our area, including adoption, education, spay/neuter programs, and investigation into animal cruelty. The Food Pantry for Pets provides a limited amount of pet food for animals. Our public education programs are available to schools, youth and civic groups, promoting kindness to all living creatures and providing instruction on the proper care and treatment of animals.
