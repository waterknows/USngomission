Worldwide Orphans Foundation (WWO) was founded in 1997 by Dr. Jane Aronson, a renowned pediatric infectious disease and adoption medicine specialist, who has dedicated her life to working with children. Our mission is to transform the lives of orphaned children and help them to become healthy, independent, productive members of their communities and the world. WWO addresses children's physical and mental health, their education and their ability to plan for and to achieve that is productive and fulfilling in their own countries.
