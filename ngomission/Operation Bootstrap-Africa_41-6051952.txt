Operation Bootstrap Africa (OBA) is a Minnesota-based, inter-denominational organization dedicated to helping people help themselves in a variety of educational programs in Africa. OBA began its mission of service in Tanzania in the mid-1960's, and was incorporated in 1965. OBA seeks to assist with educational opportunity in Africa, and has funded more than 2,250 classrooms and teachers' quarters in Tanzania alone. In that same timeframe the literacy rate of Tanzania has gone from 10% to 85%. In recent years, OBA has expanded into Madagascar, Zimbabwe and The Gambia, always working on self-help partnership agreements, in response to requests for assistance.
