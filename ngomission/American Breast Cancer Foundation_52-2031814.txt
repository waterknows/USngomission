Established in 1997, the American Breast Cancer Foundation provides a fighting chance for every life threatened by breast cancer. Our goal is to provide individuals in financial need access to screening and diagnostic tests for breast cancer, no matter what age, race, sex, or financial challenges they have. We are unparalleled in providing direct financial assistance grants to help with the costs of screening and diagnostic mammograms, breast ultrasounds, consultations with surgeons and biopsies. For breast cancer patients, assistance is available for support items including wigs for chemotherapy patients, breast prostheses and specialized bras, prescription medication assistance, travel reimbursement and lymphedema compression garments. The American Breast Cancer Foundation also promotes health education and provides life saving breast cancer screenings and pertinent educational information in outreach events. We are providing individuals a chance to say "I can beat cancer!"
