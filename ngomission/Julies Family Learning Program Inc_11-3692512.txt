Julie's Family Learning Program is a community-based family support and education program that is committed to the development of strong, stable, healthy family functioning. Julie's breaks the cycle of poverty among low-income families by providing services that enable poor, at-risk mothers and their children to transform their lives and become healthy, responsible, successful, and economically self-sufficient members of their communities. Julie's was founded in 1974 by two educators, Jean Sullivan, SND and Louise Kearns, SND, who had been working closely with struggling, female-headed families living in crisis at the margins of society. Julie's began as two independent organizations: Julie's Children's House and the Adult Learning Program which merged in 1980.
