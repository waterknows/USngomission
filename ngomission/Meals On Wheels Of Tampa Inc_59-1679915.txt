Meals On Wheels of Tampa is committed to the mission of nourishing and enriching the independent lives of the homebound and seniors. Meals On Wheels serves approximately 660 individuals with a hot, nutritious meal delivered to their door by a caring volunteer. The quality of the food provides nourishment for the body. The encouraging words from volunteers, provides enrichment for the soul. For many of the homebound, a visit from a volunteer is the only human contact they will receive that day. Together we strengthen the community by caring for a segment of our population who are often forgotten and can not get out of the house.
