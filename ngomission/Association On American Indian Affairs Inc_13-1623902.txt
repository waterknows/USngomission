Established in 1922, the Association on American Indian Affairs' (AAIA) mission is to promote the welfare of American Indians and Alaska Natives by supporting efforts to sustain and perpetuate their cultures and languages; protect their sovereignty, constitutional, legal and human rights, and natural resources; and improve their health, education, and economic and community development. Our programs fall into four main categories: youth/education, health, cultural preservation and sovereignty. We work to preserve Native languages, including a dedicated website for that purpose which can be found at www.aaialanguageprogram.org, provide legal support to protect sacred places, work to repatriate human remains and sacred objects to tribes, are engaged in advocacy in the fields of Indian child welfare and juvenile justice, and have college and graduate scholarship and summer camp grant programs.
