Mission: Tedford Housing works with people in their communities to find lasting solutions to the challenges of homelessness. We provide shelter, housing and services that empower adults, children and families in need. Founded in 1988, Tedford Housing believes that everyone deserves to have a safe and affordable home. Over the years, the organization has evolved from providing emergency shelter to adults in Brunswick to offering shelter, supported housing and homeless prevention services in 33 towns. People who are homeless often face numerous obstacles in their lives, so Tedford staff partner with various agencies depending on an individual's or family's specific circumstances.
