Founded in 1907 to care for the orphans of the San Francisco earthquake, Catholic Charities has been a leader in providing human services to the Bay Area for more than 100 years. Today, we operate more than 30 programs throughout San Francisco, Marin, and San Mateo Counties. These programs change the lives of children, families in crisis, single parents, the homeless, the elderly and disabled, those living with HIV/AIDS, and refugees and immigrants. Our CYO programs bring youth - of all socioeconomic backgrounds - together to take part in organized athletic programs, summer camp, and environmental education.
