For over 100 years, the Clara White Mission has helped Jacksonville's at-risk individuals gain new perspectives on life. Founded by a former slave whose compassion for her fellow people moved her to action, the Mission has been the one-stop community center stimulating economic development through job training in educational programs, daily feedings, advancement and more. The Clara White Mission offers more than meals for the hungry and shelter for the homeless. We offer hope and a way out of the misery of a life on the streets. Yes, we provide food and shelter, but we also offer vocational programs to put people to work. Our goal is to restore those in need to meaningful, dignified lives in the community.
