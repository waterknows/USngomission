The mission of the Barbara Bush Foundation is to advocate for and establish literacy as a value in every home. We believe literacy is a right that provides equal opportunity to achieving the American dream, which every child deserves. If we help the nation's precious children get on the path to learning in the earliest years, even before they enter kindergarten, they are far more likely to succeed in school and life. We also believe in investing in low-literate parents who are unable to provide the stimulating learning environment that young children need to jumpstart their education.
