Our House provides working homeless adults and children with housing, job training, education, and children's programs in order to equip them with the skills to be successful in the workforce, in the community, and in their own families. Our House has a licensed child development center for homeless children in Arkansas. There are also out of school-time programs: after school, summer, spring break, and more. State-licensed adult education instructors teach in the Adult Learning Center. Job training, financial literacy and other programs are available for all residents. Families stay connected to Our House for a year after moving out. We serve over 1,400 men, women and children each year. Of those, at least 75% move out of homelessness.
