The mission of Children's TLC is to provide therapeutic and educational services for children with disabilities in an environment which fosters their independence and celebrates their successes. Our teachers and therapists work together to provide integrated services based on each child's individual needs. This program structure sets us apart and enables us to help these children make extraordinary progress while in our care.
