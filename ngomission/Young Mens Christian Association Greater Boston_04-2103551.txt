The YMCA of Greater Boston is dedicated to improving the health of mind, body and spirit of individuals and families in our communities. We welcome men and women, boys and girls of all incomes, faiths and cultures. We provide childcare and after-school programs for more than 3,300 children each school day in greater Boston. We provide affordable and accessible programs to more than 100,000 children, teens, adults and seniors every year, thanks to nearly 1,500 employees, 550 summer teen employees and 1,500 dedicated volunteers. We help 4,000 individuals a year from 35 countries learn to participate in our community and the local economy through English as a Second Language and job training programs.
