Founded in 1972, the Rescue Mission of Salt Lake exists to meet the physical, emotional and spiritual needs of the homeless, addicted and/or poor through humanitarian efforts and faith and maturity in Jesus Christ. We help those in need throughout the State of Utah regardless of their station in life, race, religion, or any other determining factor. We seek to help all those who ask help of us, just as the Lord Jesus would.
