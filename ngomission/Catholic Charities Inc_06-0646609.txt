The Catholic Charities, Diocese of Norwich works to respond to Christ's call to care for those in need by providing compassionate social services for individuals and families living in the Diocese of Norwich. Founded in 1954, our services have expanded from meeting basic needs, providing emergency services and assisting with adoptions to include behavioral health counseling and housing/foreclosure assistance. We continue to strive to be innovative in order to meet the needs of all people in our community, regardless of their faith or religious beliefs.
