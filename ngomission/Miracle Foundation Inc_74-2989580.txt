Founded in 2000, The Miracle Foundation is an organization dedicated to empowering orphans to reach their full potential. The Miracle Foundation changes the way orphanages are run, worldwide - starting in India. We're a group of social entrepreneurs from Austin, Texas that partners with struggling orphanages by providing food, education, love, training and yes, even college. We transform orphanages from barely surviving to totally thriving. The metrics driven approach weeds out corruption and ensures donations are going into the mouths, hearts and minds of the orphaned children we serve.
