Founded in 1932, the Highlander Research and Education Center is a residential popular education and research organization. Highlander works with people fighting for justice, equality and sustainability, supporting their efforts to take collective action to shape their own destiny. Through popular education, participatory research, and cultural work, we help create spaces - at Highlander and in local communities - where people gain knowledge, hope and courage, expanding their ideas of what is possible. Highlander helps activists to become more effective community educators and organizers, informed about the important issues driving conditions in communities today. We develop leadership and help create and support strong, democratic organizations that work for justice, equality and sustainability.
