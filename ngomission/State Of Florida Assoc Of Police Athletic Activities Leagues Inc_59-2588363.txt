State of Florida Association of Police Athletic/Activities Leagues, Inc. (SFAPAL) was formed in 1983 by five local PAL chapters: Jacksonville, Kissimmee, Miami Beach, St. Petersburg and Tampa. The Police Officers involved had a goal of developing PAL Programs in every city and county in Florida, so youth would have an opportunity to know police officers, and police officers have an opportunity to understand youth. By using athletic and education based programs during after school and weekend hours, police officers working with youth have decreased the amount of free time youth have available for negative activities. Today SFAPAL has 52 member cities and growing.
