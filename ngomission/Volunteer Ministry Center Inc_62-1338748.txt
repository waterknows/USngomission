Founded in 1987, the mission of the Volunteer Ministry Center is to facilitate permanent supportive housing for those who are homeless and to provide services to prevent homelessness. At the center, individuals can access services such as counseling, appointments with social workers, a dental clinic, laundry, phone, computer and mail services. The Volunteer Ministry Center also provides referrals to community agencies for food, shelter, medical and legal services. Subsidized apartment units are also provided for qualified individuals.
