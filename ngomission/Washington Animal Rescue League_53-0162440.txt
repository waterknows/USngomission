Since its creation in 1914, the Washington Animal Rescue League has been a leader in the field of animal welfare, caring for homeless and abused animals in our nation's capital and placing them in loving adoptive homes. In 2005 through 2006, the League underwent a revolutionary transformation, making it one of the world's most progressive animal rehabilitation centers. Each animal enjoys the best care possible, daily training and socialization support from staff and volunteers, and state-of-the-art veterinary care at the on-site medical center. Because it is bright, attractive, and filled with healthy and social animals living in comfortable living rooms, potential adopters find the League to be a welcoming place to visit and choose a companion animal.
