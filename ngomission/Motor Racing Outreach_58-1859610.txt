It is the mission of Motor Racing Outreach (MRO) to introduce the racing community to a personal faith in Christ, to growth in Christ likeness, and to active involvement in the church through relationships that provide care in times of stress, knowledge of God's word, and assistance in the development of leadership skills. MRO hopes to unify and mobilize believers worldwide to support the development of young people, who have a reason to face the future, singles, with a sense of fulfillment, husbands and wives, who honor one another, and peaceful resolutions to disputes rather than bitterness and regret.
