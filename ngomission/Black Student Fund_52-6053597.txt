The Black Student Fund (BSF) is dedicated to bringing people together by maintaining access to independent schools for black children from low to modest income households. The BSF was established in 1964 and provides scholarships as well as essential support services to black students in grades pre-kindergarten through twelve. The Black Student Fund prepares children for life and helps to create a rich, equitable educational environment in which students and adults from different racial and economic backgrounds benefit from regular interaction. Since its inception, over 2,500 scholars have matriculated through the BSF. Since 1984, every BSF senior high school scholar has successfully graduated and been accepted to prestigious universities and colleges across the country.
