Founded in 1917, Eastern Mennonite School (EMS) joins with the home and church to call students into relationship with Jesus Christ for a lifetime of acquiring the knowledge, skills, compassionate attitudes and behaviors needed for serving the world community. As a Mennonite school, EMS combines an academically challenging curriculum with a strong commitment to Christian discipleship, peace and justice issues, service, and a global outlook. Regular activities are scheduled to help students grow spiritually as well as intellectually. In study, worship, and play, students are challenged to integrate faith with life - to learn and apply Biblical standards to life's decisions.
