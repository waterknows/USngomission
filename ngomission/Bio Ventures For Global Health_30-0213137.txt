BIO Ventures for Global Health (BVGH) works to save lives by accelerating the development of novel drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics coming from the biotechnology industry that address the unmet medical needs of the developing world. We work at the crossroads of biotechnology and global health to find the common ground between the goals of the global health community and the pragmatic needs of companies. We engage companies to drive partnerships and invest in global health initiatives that result in the new drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics that will save lives in poor countries.
