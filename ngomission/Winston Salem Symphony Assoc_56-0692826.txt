Established in 1946 originally as a civic orchestra on the campus of Salem College, the Winston-Salem Symphony (WSS) incorporated in 1952 and hired its first full-time conductor in 1955. Over the years the WSS has offered a wide range of repertoires including classical orchestral and choral concert music; opera, oratorio, and ballet; and popular music. Education and community engagement performances have represented another core component of the Symphony's offerings, along with partnerships with other area arts, educational, and social services organizations.
