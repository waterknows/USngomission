Artists For Humanity's (AFH) mission is to bridge economic, racial and social divisions by providing underserved youth with the keys to self-sufficiency through paid employment in art and design. AFH tackles the myriad of problems youth face today with tremendous impact. We celebrate the talents and wonderful energy of young people by giving them hands-on experiences in creativity, business, teamwork, and self-governance. Participants learn the techniques and tools of professional artists and the business world while engaging in education, employment, artistic exploration, and entrepreneurial experience. This produces life-transforming change for youth and for their communities.
