Founded in 1992, LEAP works to develop the strengths and talents of young leaders who implement year-round, community and school-based programming designed to achieve positive academic and social outcomes for children living in high poverty urban neighborhoods. LEAP reaches into neighborhoods that are laden with a shortage of positive resources, and we empower the children and youth of these communities to be positive resources themselves. The very essence of LEAP stands for the primary components of a developing student's life: Leadership, Education, Athletics, and Partnerships.
