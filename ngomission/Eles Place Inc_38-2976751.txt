Ele's Place is a community based organization dedicated to creating awareness of and support for grieving children and their families. Through peer support group programs, Ele's Place helps children to cope with the death of a parent, sibling or other loved one. Each week at Ele's Place, hundreds of grieving children find a warm and welcoming place to meet new friends who really understand how they feel, and begin to heal after the death of a loved one.
