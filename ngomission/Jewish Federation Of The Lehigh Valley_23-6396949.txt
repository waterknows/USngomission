The Jewish Federation of the Lehigh Valley funds and supports a community-wide network of organizations that do two things: 1. Care for people in need here at home, in Israel and around the world.2. Nurture and sustain the Jewish community today and for future generations. By working with a broad cross section of community members to raise and distribute funds, we ensure that the programs, institutions and values that enrich our Jewish community remain vibrant and strong. From feeding the hungry to helping the unemployed, from supporting families with special needs to funding Jewish education and Israel experiences, the Jewish Federation is focused on addressing the most pressing issues facing our community every day. As part of the Jewish Federation movement, the leading Jewish philanthropy in North America, we are able to advocate nationally and quickly mobilize resources in times of crisis.
