Little Sisters of the Poor of Pittsburgh established their mission in the city of Pittsburgh in 1872. Little Sisters of the Poor care for the elderly poor in the spirit of humble service. We welcome the elderly as we would Jesus Christ himself and serve them with love and respect until death. The Little Sisters of the Poor offer independent living and nursing care to the elderly poor. Every effort is made to give residents a sense of dignity, human and personal respect and security in the face of advancing age. We provide a comfortable home where our residents are surrounded by love and engaged in purposeful activity.
