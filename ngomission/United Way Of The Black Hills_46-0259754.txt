United Way of the Black Hills organizes and implements an annual fundraising campaign to help support the budgets of 52 local nonprofit agencies. Currently, community-wide campaigns are conducted in Rapid City, Sturgis, Lead, Deadwood, Spearfish, Belle Fourche, Keystone, Hill City, Custer, Hot Springs, and Edgemont. To keep costs to a minimum, the United Way office, located in Rapid City, serves as the only administrative office for United Way of the Black Hills, and provides assistance to all participating communities. United Way also gives direct assistance to individuals through information and referral, and spearheads efforts to identify community needs, develops a community response to those needs, and promotes teamwork among local nonprofits
