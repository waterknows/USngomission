Founded in 1969, the Wildlife Care Center works to rescue, rehabilitate, and release native wildlife that has been harmed or displaced; to treat and place certain needy domestic, exotic and farm animals; and to educate the and to educate the public toward coexistence with all animals. The SPCA Wildlife Care Center serves the South Florida Tri-County region with rescue, rehabilitation and release services for our native wildlife at no cost to citizens. We admit approximately 13,000 injured, orphaned, abandoned or abused native wild animals or exotic domestic animals per year. Our property houses up to 875 animals at any given time in dozens of habitats and rehabilitation areas and our goal is to release those animals that have responded successfully to treatment back to the wild. The Wildlife Care Center is an affiliate of The Humane Society of the United States.
