Founded in 1972, the Clearwater Marine Aquarium (CMA) works to restore and protect our marine environment. We accomplish our mission through preserving our marine life and environment while inspiring the human spirit through leadership in education, research, rescue, rehabilitation, and release. Today, Clearwater Marine Aquarium is an internationally respected center for animal care, public education and marine research. Yet, in spite of tremendous growth and a global presence, we also remain a neighborhood aquarium, a place where children and adults alike can visit anytime to wonder at the unending diversity, grace and beauty of the creatures of the sea. We invite everyone to visit often and soon to share in the environmental excellence and caring of our waters and marine life, no matter where you may live.
