Founded in 1953, the Kidney & Urology Foundation of America (KUFA) is a national organization dedicated to helping people with kidney and urologic diseases and individuals waiting for organ and tissue transplants. KUFA focuses on care and support of the patient, the concerns of those at risk, education for the community and medical professionals, methods of prevention, and improved treatment options. In the last decade, over $10 million in clinical and basic research grants have been provided to more than 20 major medical institutions throughout the country. This funding is critical to improving the diagnosis, evaluation, treatment and care of childhood and adult kidney and urologic diseases.
