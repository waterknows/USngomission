The mission of the Mountain Home Christian Clinic is to provide health care and spiritual support to those of our community who for various reasons cannot afford or are not being served by the established system. Services will be provided as an expression of Christian love using a volunteer professional staff. Services include: complete pharmacy services; primary medical care; optometry and eye glasses; physical, respiratory and occupational therapy; diabetes management; nutritional counseling; spiritual counseling; social work referrals; prescription refills; resource referrals; medical lab and x-ray services; emergency dental care; and medication assistance for clinic patients.
