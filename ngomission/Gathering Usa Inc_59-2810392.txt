The Gathering was officially formed in 1987 in Orlando, Florida. It has been a point of connection for many spiritually flat or disinterested men caught in the pressures of contemporary life. The Gathering has worked closely with local churches in a number of cities across the US and encouraged men to get involved in the church of their choice. They operate Bible study/luncheons and small groups to help men grow further in their Christian walk. The Gathering has also published resource books and a video for small group, hosts seminars, short-term social outreaches, mission trips to the Dominican Republic and outreach breakfasts for men.
