Organized by a group of volunteer healthcare professionals, The Neighborhood Christian Clinic exists simply to:

provide medical and dental healthcare services to the uninsured, underserved community, share the Gospel and love of Jesus Christ with interested patients and colleagues, and train and equip healthcare professionals to respectfully share the Gospel and love of Jesus Christ in their daily practice.
