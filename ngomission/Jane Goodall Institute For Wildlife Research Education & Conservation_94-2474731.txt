Founded in 1977, the Jane Goodall Institute advances the power of individuals to take informed and compassionate action to improve the environment of all living things. The objectives of the Institute are to: increase primate habitat conservation; increase awareness of, support for and training in issues related to our relationship with each other, the environment and other animals (leading to behavior change); expand non-invasive research programs on chimpanzees and other primates; and to promote activities that ensure the well-being of chimpanzees, other primates and animal welfare activities in general.
