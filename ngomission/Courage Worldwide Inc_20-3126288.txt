At Courage Worldwide, we believe each and every individual was created on purpose for a unique purpose and that purpose has life altering, eternal implications. Since opening in 2005, CWW has simply helped people find that purpose. But in 2007, we realized we live in a world where children are sold for sex. When we discovered it wasn't just in our world but in our own country, our city and state, we became overwhelmed by the fact that these children will die after enduring years of torture – never being and doing all they were created to do – if somebody didn't do something. So we build them homes, call them family and provide all the resources they need to be and do all God created them to be. Now many who were once called tortured and traumatized are called rescued and restored living lives focused on discovering their true identities and fulfilling their destiny.
