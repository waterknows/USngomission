ACCION New Mexico increases access to business credit, makes loans, and provides training which enable entrepreneurs to realize their dreams and be catalysts for positive economic and social change. Our unique approach - called microlending - can trace its roots back more than 40 years with efforts to reduce extreme poverty in Latin America and now helps small New Mexico, Arizona, and Colorado businesses provide for themselves and their families. Since making our first loan in 1994, we have helped small business owners in more than 277 communities, working in some of these states' most underserved urban neighborhoods and most isolated rural communities.
