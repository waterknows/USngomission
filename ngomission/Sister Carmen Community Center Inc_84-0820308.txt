Founded in 1978, Sister Carmen Community Center (SCCC) is a Family Resource Center and East Boulder County's only comprehensive source of individual and family services. They have been serving their community for over 30 years. They utilize a strengths-based approach in working with participants, recognizing that everyone has a collection of strengths upon which to build. Many programs will refer to helping their participants reach Self Sufficiency. While they use that term, they also recognize that no individual or family is an island. People need people. They want to provide families the resources that can support their efforts towards achieving economic stability and building natural community supports.
