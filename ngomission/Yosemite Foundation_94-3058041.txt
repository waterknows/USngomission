Providing for Yosemite's future is our passion. Yosemite Conservancy is the only philanthropic organization dedicated exclusively to the protection and preservation of Yosemite National Park. We inspire people to support projects and programs that preserve and protect Yosemite National Park's resources and enrich the visitor experience. With the support of our donors, we have completed more than 330 projects providing more than $60 million in support to Yosemite. We are committed to creating unique opportunities for people to connect with the park, through restoring hiking trails and iconic lookouts, providing outdoor education and volunteer programs.
