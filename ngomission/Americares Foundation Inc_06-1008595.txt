In times of epic disaster, daily struggle or civil conflict, AmeriCares restores health and saves lives by delivering medicines, medical supplies and humanitarian aid to people in need around the world and across the United States. Since its founding in 1982, the nonprofit global health and disaster relief organization has delivered more than $11 billion in aid to 164 countries. AmeriCares is able to maximize the impact of each donation due to its gift-in-kind model and the contributions received from pharmaceutical and medical supply manufacturers, as well as our partnerships with local health care providers around the world. Since 2010, for every $100 donated, AmeriCares has provided $2,000 in humanitarian relief to people in need, including medicines, medical supplies, nutritional supplements and other vital aid.
