Cure Alzheimer's Fund was established to fund targeted research with the highest probability of slowing, stopping or reversing Alzheimer's disease through venture based philanthropy.  All organizational expenses are paid for by the Founders and Board, allowing all other contributions to be applied directly to Alzheimer's Disease research. Our foundational research is focused on identifying all the genes and gene mutations that are linked to Alzheimer's Disease. We can then use this genetic information to reliably predict, early in life, those at greatest risk for the disease (with legal safeguards and genetic and psychological counseling). Our foundational research projects include: Alzheimer's Genome Project, Alzheimer's Genome Map, Alzheimer's Brain-Genetic Study, Alzheimer's Clinical-Genetic Study, Alzheimer's Gene Database, MicroRNA's and APP, and Alzheimer's Gene Discovery Project.
