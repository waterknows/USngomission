SFJAZZ is a recognized international leader in jazz creation, presentation, and education. SFJAZZ explores the full spectrum of jazz, from the music's origins in the African American community to its diverse present-day expressions around the world. Working to develop the audience for jazz in the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond, SFJAZZ celebrates jazz as a living art form, built on a constantly evolving tradition. SFJAZZ presents a wealth of year-round programs, including the internationally acclaimed San Francisco Jazz Festival, the SFJAZZ Spring Season and numerous community outreach and education programs. Founded in 1983 under the name of Jazz in the City, the organization adopted its new identity as SFJAZZ in late 1999, in recognition of its expansion from seasonal music presenter to year-round arts institution.
