SOS Children's Villages believes that every child deserves a loving home. We build families for orphaned, abandoned and other vulnerable children in 134 countries and territories, including the United States. We are the largest nonprofit organization dedicated to the care of orphaned and abandoned children.Founded in 1949, we provide children with the love and long-term support they need to shape their own futures - a stable family, quality medical care and the opportunity to learn. Through our family support and care programs, medical centers, schools and emergencyrelief efforts we impact the lives of millions of children and families.
