Our mission is to improve the quality of life for the EOD family by providing emergency financial relief, scholarship opportunities, physical, social, and emotional support.EOD stands for Explosive Ordnance Disposal, the disarming and disposal of bombs. EOD technicians are highly-trained military members serving in the Army, Marines, Navy and Air Force who are responsible for disarming, rendering safe and disposing bombs. The EOD profession is one of the most dangerous occupations in the military.The EOD Warrior Foundation is supported by an indivisible network of EOD family and friends. This support enables wounded EOD warriors and their families, and families of fallen EOD warriors to face the future with hope, knowing they are not alone, as they forge a new life and ensures the EOD heroes who make the ultimate sacrifice will never be forgotten.
