Every day of every year the Jewish Federation of the Desert works with hundreds of local, national and international agencies to transform lives and deliver hope, dignity and comfort to millions of people at home, in Israel and around the world - ordinary people facing extraordinary needs even in ordinary times. Our Federation-supported programs and agencies restore hope and mend the lives of our most vulnerable - the elderly, the homeless, the under-educated, victims of abuse and violence, and others in need. Through strategic endeavors, they support a spectrum of crucial social services including counseling, group therapy, special needs programs, emergency food assistance, mentoring/literacy programs and risk intervention.

We also inspire Jewish families to connect to the Jewish community by supporting a vast array of programs - early childhood centers, day schools, after-school activities, teen programs, Hillels, adult education and Israel experiences.
