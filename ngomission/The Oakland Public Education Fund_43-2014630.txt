The Oakland Schools Foundation (OSF) is a local education fund founded in 2003 by a group of Oakland principals and community leaders to raise funds for programs in Oakland's new small schools. Today, OSF partners with the District to secure and manage resources for ALL Oakland public schools so that every student has the opportunity to achieve excellence.
