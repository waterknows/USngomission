Since 1974, Meals on Wheels of Wake County wants to end senior hunger in our community by serving the elderly, homebound and people with disabilities. We serve 1,300 noontime meals every weekday to the elderly, homebound and persons with disabilities of Wake County. Our outreach consists of hot meals to homebound individuals, communal dining for seniors in congregate dining rooms, and frozen meal service for dialysis patients and other homebound individuals in isolated areas. Over 2,200 volunteers help us deliver meals Monday through Friday each week.
