Canvasback Missions, Inc. was founded in 1981 to serve remote Pacific islands with urgently needed health care, dental services and health education. In partnership with the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the U. S. Government, Canvasback operates a Diabetes Wellness Center on Majuro Atoll. Canvasback also partners with the Governments of Micronesia to send specialty surgery and dental teams to their small State Hospitals. The objectives of these teams of volunteers are to provide healing surgeries for islanders who might otherwise not receive care and to empower the local health care providers. Canvasback has programs to involve American youth in service to the islanders. We are a Christian organization with an emphasis on demonstrating, rather than preaching the love of God.
