In November 1973, the Gay Men's VD Clinic, part of the Washington Free Clinic, began operating in the basement of the Georgetown Lutheran Church. This was the birth of what was to become Whitman-Walker Clinic.

For more than three decades, the Clinic has been renowned - locally, nationally and internationally - for the high-quality, culturally sensitive care it provides. This work remains critical in an area with the highest HIV infection rate in the country. Our mission is to be the highest quality, culturally competent community health center serving greater Washington's diverse urban community, including individuals who face barriers to accessing care, and with a special expertise in LGBT and HIV care.
