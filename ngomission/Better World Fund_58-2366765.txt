The Better World Fund (BWF) was created in 1998 by entrepreneur and philanthropist Ted Turner. The Better World Fund builds and implements public-private partnerships to address the world's most pressing problems, and works to broaden support for the UN through advocacy and public outreach. The BWF coordinates several domestic advocacy and partnership efforts. Through our campaigns and partnerships, we seek to make it easy for corporations, nongovernmental organizations, and individuals to engage in the work of the United Nations.
