The Petco Foundation has served as a voice for companion animals across the country since 1999. Each year, we help animal-welfare organizations find lifelong, loving homes for millions of orphaned pets, as well as fund spay and neuter efforts, animal assisted therapy programs and humane education. Today, the Foundation donates about $11 million a year to assist companion animals across the country. The organization is funded through donations raised during seasonal fundraisers conducted in Petco's 1,000 plus stores in all 50 United States, as well as from Petco associates, vendors and corporate contributions.. The majority of the funds raised remain in the community in which they were raised, but the Petco Foundation is also involved in many national animal welfare efforts. The Petco Foundation's mission is to raise the quality of life for pets and people who love and need them. The Petco Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation (#33-0845930).
