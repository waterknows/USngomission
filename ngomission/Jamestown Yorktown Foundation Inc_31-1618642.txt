The mission of the Jamestown-Yorktown Foundation is to educate and promote understanding and awareness of Virginia's role in the creation of the United States of America. The Foundation, accredited by the American Association of Museums, is an educational institution of the Commonwealth of Virginia and administers two living-history museums. Jamestown Settlement interprets the cultures of 17th-century colonial Jamestown, America's first permanent English settlement, and the Powhatan Indians. The Yorktown Victory Center interprets the impact of the American Revolution on the people of America and the development of the new nation.
