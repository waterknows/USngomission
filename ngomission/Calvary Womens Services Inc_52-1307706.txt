Calvary Women's Services offers housing, health, employment and education programs that empower homeless women in Washington, DC to change their lives. Founded in 1983, our programs carry out our mission to offer "a safe, caring place for tonight; support, hope and change for tomorrow." These programs include transitional and permanent housing, personalized case management, life skills and education opportunities, job training, health and wellness services, on-site therapy, and daily addiction recovery meetings. At Calvary, we believe that every woman has the strengths and gifts she needs to be successful. Each woman in our programs identifies and builds on her strengths, meeting her goals for safe housing, good health, and financial independence. We know that our programs work: every five days, a woman moves from Calvary into her own home.
