We grant the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions to enrich the human experience with hope, strength and joy. Since receiving its charter in 1986, The Make-A-Wish FoundationÂ® of the Hudson Valley has granted the wishes of more than 1,800 children in the Hudson Valley region with life-threatening medical conditions. Serving the eight counties of Delaware, Dutchess, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Sullivan, Ulster and Westchester, the Chapter's mission is to ensure that every child residing in the Hudson Valley who qualifies for Make-A-Wish services is granted his or her fondest wish. While wishes are referred and completed on an ongoing basis, an average of 120 wishes are in progress at any given time.
