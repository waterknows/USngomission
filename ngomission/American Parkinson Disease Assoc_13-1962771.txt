The American Parkinson Disease Association (APDA) was founded in 1961 to ease the burden and find a cure for Parkinson's disease through research, patient and family support and education. Parkinson's disease is a progressive disorder of the central nervous system affecting more than 1.5 million people in the United States. APDA's education program provides information and resources to patients, their families, friends, doctors and other medical professionals and enhances public education and awareness of the disease. APDA sponsors 56 chapters and 1,000 support groups which provide education, counseling, assistance and referrals throughout the United States.
