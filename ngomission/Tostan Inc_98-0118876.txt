Tostan's mission is to empower African communities to bring about sustainable development and positive social transformation based on respect for human rights. Tostan means "breakthrough" in the West African language of Wolof. Since 1991, Tostan has brought its holistic 30-month education program to thousands of communities in ten African countries. Currently, Tostan offers an education program called the Community Empowerment Program to hundreds of villages in West and East Africa. In addition, Tostan has adapted a special version of this program for prisoners in Senegal.
