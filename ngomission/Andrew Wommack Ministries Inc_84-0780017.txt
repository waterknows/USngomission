Andrew Wommack Ministries' vision is to teach the truth of the Gospel to the body of Christ throughout America and the world with special emphasis on God's unconditional love and the balance between grace and faith. This vision is fulfilled by traveling to speaking engagements, producing radio broadcasts, and distributing audio cassette tapes, millions of which are provided at no cost to those who could not afford them. In 1994 a cornerstone of the ministry was laid in place with the dedication of Charis Bible College - a college committed to equipping the saints for ministry by providing sound biblical teaching and practical on-the-job training.
