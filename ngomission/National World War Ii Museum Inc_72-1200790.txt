The National World War II Museum tells the story of the American Experience in the war that changed the world - why it was fought, how it was won, and what it means today - so that all generations will understand the price of freedom and be inspired by what they learn. Dedicated in 2000 as The National D-Day Museum and now designated by Congress as the country's official museum of the Second World War, it celebrates the American Spirit, the teamwork, optimism, courage and sacrifice of the men and women fought on the battlefront and the Home Front. The Museum has begun a $300 million expansion that, when complete, will create a six-acre campus of exhibition pavilions, the 4-D Victory Theater, Stage Door Canteen and a research and conference center in downtown New Orleans.
