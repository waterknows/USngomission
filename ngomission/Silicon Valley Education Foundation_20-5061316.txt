Silicon Valley Education Foundation (SVEF) focuses on raising student performances in the critical areas of math and science across all 33 Santa Clara County school districts. Our goal is to be the leading advocate for public education in the region. SVEF was founded on the belief that a new kind of organization is needed- one with a different philosophy and approach to the challenges in legacy systems. A nonprofit resource and advocate for students and educators, SVEF is dedicated to putting all students on track for college and careers, focusing on science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).
