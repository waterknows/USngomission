Tender Mercies transforms the lives of homeless adults with mental illness by providing security, dignity, and community in a place they call home. Security means a housing environment where residents' personal safety is a priority. Dignity means a housing environment that allows residents to develop personal, social, and economic strengths. And community is a regular, predictable housing environment that offers a sense of family, while affirming the individual. We achieve our mission by maintaining 134 units of permanent supportive housing and 16 units of transitional housing in 6 buildings in Over-the-Rhine. Our model of housing is based on the belief that by addressing the root causes of homelessness, we can help an individual break the cycle of homelessness once he or she leaves Tender Mercies.
