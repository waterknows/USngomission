The Himalayan Cataract Project (HCP) works to eradicate preventable and curable blindness through high quality ophthalmic care, education and the establishment of a world-class eye care infrastructure. At the core of HCP's work is its goal to achieve high-quality, low-cost eye care that can be sustained in the developing world for the long-term. HCP trains local eye care teams with methodologies optimized for the developing world. All training and education hinges on maximizing the capacity of eye care staff at all levels. This allows for the expansion of efficient eye care delivery, an increased number of patients treated, and an increased number of trained eye care specialists who can then train future eye care providers.
