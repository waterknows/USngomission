We provide emergency and transitional shelter for homeless families from Indian River, St. Lucie, Martin, and Okeechobee Counties. Our facility can accommodate eight families in the Emergency Shelter and eleven families in the Transitional Shelter, for a total of 72 individuals that we may serve on any given day. We partner with a dedicated group of volunteers, local businesses, and the United Way to provide services for our clients such as children's programs, employment training, budgeting, meal planning, parenting, and life skills. Our mission is to provide opportunities for homeless families to end homelessness by achieving self-sufficiency through education, living wages, and permanent housing.In 2012 HFC started A Second Chance Thrift and Retail Training Center just 100 yards north of HFC. It provides on-the-job-training in retail for our families. It also provides clothing and furniture for our homeless families, as well as recycling used goods.
