Founded in 1976, Southeastern Legal Foundation (SLF) is a national constitutional public interest law firm and policy center that advocates limited government, individual economic freedom, and the free enterprise system in the courts of law and public opinion. Our mission is to engage in litigation and public policy advocacy in support of these principles. We look for cases and issues in which our involvement makes a difference, not just to the parties involved, but also on the policies and issues in dispute. We are not a single-issue organization; rather, we are a conservative public interest law firm and policy center dedicated to creating binding legal precedent and positive public policy change for all Americans.
