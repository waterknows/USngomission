Founded in 1979, the mission of the Cleveland International Film Festival is to promote artistically and culturally significant film arts through education and exhibition to enrich the life of the community. In other words, the CIFF presents the newest and best films from around the world and does everything in its power to make sure its audience learns something along the way - about other cultures, about current events, about the experience from the filmmakers themselves.
