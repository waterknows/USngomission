The Y is a charity dedicated to youth development, healthy living and social responsibility. There's so much more to the Y than many people realize. From exercise to education, from volleyball to volunteerism, from preschool to preventive health, the Y doesn't just strengthen bodies. It strengthens communities.Each year, over 100,000 kids and families participate in the Y. Y programs instill confidence, skills and self-esteem for all who participate - from the baby learning to swim to the senior regaining her strength after an illness. Through the many programs and services offered at our eleven metropolitan locations and in the community, we help people grow strong in spirit, mind and body.
