The Make-A-Wish Foundation of South Carolina got its start with the first wish on November 10, 1984. We grant the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions to enrich the human experience with hope, strength and joy. Each year the South Carolina chapter grants over 130 wishes and, since the very first wish in 1984, has granted over 2,000 wishes to children with life-threatening medical conditions. We have never turned down a medically qualified South Carolina child for a wish, a tradition that we proudly carry on year after year.
