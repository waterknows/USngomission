Spondylitis Association of America (SAA) is the only nonprofit organization in the US dedicating 100% of its resources to improving the lives of the spondylitis community. SAA focuses on funding and promoting medical research, advancing education, providing extensive supportive programs and aggressively advocating on behalf of all those affected by spondylitis. We aim to be a leader in the quest to cure ankylosing spondylitis and related diseases, and to empower those affected to live life to the fullest. Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a form of arthritis that primarily affects the spine, although other joints can become involved. It causes inflammation of the spinal joints (vertebrae) that can lead to severe, chronic pain and discomfort. AS is the primary disease in the group of diseases known as Spondylitis, Spondyloarthropathy or Spondyloarthritis.
