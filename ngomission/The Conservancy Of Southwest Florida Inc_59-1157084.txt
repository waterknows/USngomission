Founded in 1964, the Conservancy of Southwest Florida works to protect Southwest Florida's unique natural environment and quality of life . . .now and forever. We envision a region where our land, water and wildlife are protected, our citizens are informed and our leaders make decisions with the health, wellness and sustainability of our region in mind. We seek to increase our knowledge of the natural world through continued scientific research and to increase our impact through collaboration with our partners. Our staff biologists research the issues impacting our environment. Members of our environment policy team promote sound environmental policies based on the best available science. Wildlife rehabilitation specialists care for injured, sick and orphaned wildlife, while our naturalists interpret the information through a variety of educational programs.
