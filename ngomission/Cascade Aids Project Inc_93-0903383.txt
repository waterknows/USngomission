Cascade AIDS Project (CAP) is the oldest and largest AIDS Service Organization serving Oregon and SW Washington. We operate with a mission to prevent HIV infections, support and empower people affected and infected by HIV/AIDS, and eliminate HIV/AIDS related stigma. 



CAP offers a broad array of services through our two program departments, Support Services and Prevention & Education. Within Support Services our program offerings include emergency, short-term and long-term housing support for people infected and affected by HIV/AIDS, as well as psycho-social support, employment counseling, and support for kids and families. 



Within Prevention & Education our program offerings include HIV and STD counseling and testing services; prevention, education and outreach to high-risk populations including communities of color, youth and gay and bisexual men; and a drop-in center offering culturally appropriate prevention and education services for gay and bisexual men.
