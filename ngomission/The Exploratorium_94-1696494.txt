The Exploratorium is an internationally renowned museum of science, art, and human perception. Its mission is to create a culture of learning through innovative environments, programs, and tools that help people nurture their curiosity about the world around them. The vision of the Exploratorium is to change how the world learns. Specifically, by change we mean to move individuals from passive consumption of information and other people' claims to active, personal explorers of the natural and technological worlds and themselves.
