The mission of the Prevent Cancer Foundation is to save lives through cancer prevention and early detection. The Foundation focuses its energies and resources on those cancers - including breast, cervical, colorectal, lung, oral, prostate, skin, and testicular - that can be prevented through lifestyle changes or detection and treatment in their early stages. Since our inception almost 30 years ago, we have provided more than $140 million in support of cancer prevention and early detection research, education, advocacy, and community outreach programs nationwide and have played a pivotal role in developing a body of knowledge that is the basis for important prevention and early detection strategies. We have funded over 400 scientists at over 150 leading medical institutions across the country. Our public education programs have applied this scientific knowledge to teach the public on ways they can reduce their cancer risks.
