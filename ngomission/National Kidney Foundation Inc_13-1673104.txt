The National Kidney Foundation is dedicated to preventing the growing public health challenge of kidney disease, improving the health and well-being of individuals and families affected by kidney disease and promoting organ donation.



With local offices nationwide, the NKF conducts extensive public, patient, and professional education; provides early detection screenings; advocates for patients through public policy and legislative action; and supports research into the prevention and treatment of kidney disease.



The NKF relies on individual and corporate donations, foundation and government grants, memberships and special events. Find out more at kidney.org.
