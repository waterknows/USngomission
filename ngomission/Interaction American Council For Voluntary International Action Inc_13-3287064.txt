Formed in 1984, InterAction is the largest coalition of U.S. based international nongovernmental organizations focused on the world's poor and most vulnerable people. Our 175 members work in every developing country. Members meet people halfway in expanding opportunities and supporting gender equality in education, health care, agriculture, small business, and other areas. InterAction brings the values and experience of the NGO community into the broader development and humanitarian assistance community through strategic alliances with key partners around particular issues and objectives. These partnerships further leverage InterAction's political, intellectual, and financial capital.
