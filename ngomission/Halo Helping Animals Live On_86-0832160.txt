HALO (Helping Animals Live On) is a private, non-profit organization founded in 1994 by two women, Michel Herstam and Heather Allen, out of their homes in Phoenix, AZ. HALO provides temporary shelter to abandoned cats and dogs until they can be adopted into a permanent home. We help Animals Live On through increased adoption, sterilization and pet care education. Since HALO's inception in 1994, over 30,000 dogs and cats have found a new home, with our adoption numbers growing every year. In 2013, we adopted out over 7,000 dogs and cats in to new homes, giving them a second chance at happiness!
