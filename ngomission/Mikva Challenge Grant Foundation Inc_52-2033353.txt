Mikva Challenge develops youth to be informed, empowered, and active citizens and community leaders. We do this by engaging youth in action civics, an authentic and transformative learning process built on youth voice and youth expertise. We help low-income Chicago youth become meaningful actors in politics and, by doing so, we honor the Mikvas' decades of inspiring young adults to embark on careers in public service and politics. Since 2000, Mikva Challenge has trained over 40,000 young people through our elections, activism and policymaking programs. Through the Mikva process, young people connect with peers, adults and political issues, strategize about how to win their issue or campaign and take action to become real political participants.
