Founded in 1956, the Council of Independent Colleges (CIC) is an association of independent colleges and universities working together to support college and university leadership, advance institutional excellence, and enhance private higher education's contributions to society. CIC is the major national service organization for all small and mid-sized, independent, liberal arts colleges and universities in the U.S. CIC is not a lobbying organization, but rather focuses on providing services to campus leaders as well as seminars, workshops, and programs that assist institutions in improving educational programs, administrative and financial performance, and institutional visibility.
