Since 1986, Student Sponsor Partners (SSP) has been providing at-risk students in New York City with the opportunity of a quality, non-public high school education, through the financial support and one-to-one guidance of a sponsor. SSP serves youths who are academically at-risk, financially disadvantaged, and socially needy (with roughly three-quarters of our population coming from single-parent homes). Each SSP student is paired with a Sponsor, who provides tuition assistance for the student to attend a private high school and serves as a role model and academic coach until graduation day. The combination of a committed Sponsor and a challenging scholastic environment dramatically improves SSP students' prospects, not only for earning their diplomas but also for achieving real and lasting life-success after high school.
