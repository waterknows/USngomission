The United Jewish Community of the Virginia Peninsula, Inc., (which includes the Jewish Community Center), an organization dedicated to serving the Jewish communities of Hampton, Newport News, York County, Williamsburg, Poquoson, Smithfield, Isle of Wight, and Gloucester, provides educational, recreational, and cultural programs; defends the rights of Jewish people; maintains a program of social services; and raises and allocates funds for the support of Jewish people locally, in Israel, and other countries around the world. The ultimate goal of the United Jewish Community is to create a Jewish community which is respectful of Jewish differences; which is knowledgeable of and committed to Jewish values and practice; which participates in synagogue life and Jewish communal and cultural life; which makes Israel a central component in its identity as a community; which has a sense of cultural pride; and which manifests its Jewishness in lifestyle, life choices, and life commitment.
