Founded in 1993, the Marion Institute acts as an incubator for a diverse array of programs and projects that delve into the root cause of an issue and seeks to create deep and positive change. We work with individuals, schools and communities to inspire change in the areas of health and healing, sustainability, green economics, environmental education, spirituality and much more. The Marion Institute seeks to engage the widest possible number of people in seeing, connecting and participating in new ways that best support their own lives, and those of the wider community at large. We believe in the interdependence of all life and the critical balance necessary for a sustainable future.
