Village Missions began meeting the spiritual needs of rural communities in Canada and the United States in 1948. Village Missions is non-denominational. We focus our ministry efforts where there is no evangelical church or where it is in danger of ceasing. Hundreds of church leaders, pastors, and international missionaries trace their roots back to country churches served by Village Missions. We serve more than 230 communities. Village Missions brings the hope of salvation to places where there might otherwise be no gospel message.
