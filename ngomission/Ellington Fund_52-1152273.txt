Based in Washington, DC, the Ellington Fund (the Fund) is the charitable arm of the Duke Ellington School of the Arts (DESA). The mission is to support several programs at DESA that are not funded by the DC Public School System (DCPS). The Fund provides critical services as it seeks to bridge the gap between DCPS budget allocations and the actual cost of DESA's dual arts/academic curriculum. The Fund provides 25% of the school's revenues and, together with the school, supports 540 high school students who come from all Wards of the city, with many not being able to otherwise afford the costs of an arts education. Ellington has a 99% graduation rate and 95% college acceptance rate, which is remarkable, as many of our students enter 9th grade at or below reading and math proficiency levels.
