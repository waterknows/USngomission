Founded in 1981, Philadelphia Volunteers for the Indigent Program (VIP) provides legal services for low-income residents and families facing civil legal problems that threaten their basic human needs - shelter, employment, financial stability, education and health. Through its volunteers and staff, VIP serves more than 1,000 individuals and families yearly who could not otherwise afford attorneys and whose cases could or would not be handled by other public interest organizations. VIP handles any civil matter that is non-fee generating and for which there is no right to counsel. Our caseload includes: child support, employment/wage claims, tax issues, disability, landlord/tenant appeals, public housing evictions, probate, tangled title, consumer debt, litigation defense, child custody, adoption/guardianship, special education and school discipline, name change and immigration issues.
