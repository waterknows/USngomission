Cincinnati Habitat is committed to building the quality of life, health and prosperity of the region through the production and preservation of homeownership - because homes and families are the foundation of successful communities. We are best known for our homeownership program that builds and rehabs simple, affordable homes in partnership with low-income families and volunteers from the surrounding communities. We sell the homes with affordable, zero percent interest mortgages, making a 30-year commitment to each new homeowner and to the community in which they live. We also preserve homeownership by helping veterans in need through our new Repair Corps Program. By providing veterans and their families with critical home repairs we are participating in a nationwide effort by Habitat for Humanity to impact more families on an annual basis.
