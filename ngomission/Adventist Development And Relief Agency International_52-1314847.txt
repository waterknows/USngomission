ADRA (Adventist Development and Relief Agency) was initiated by the Seventh-day Adventist church in 1956. The basis for its existence is to follow Christ's example by being a voice for, serving, and partnering with those in need. ADRA works with people in poverty and distress to create positive change and justness through empowering partnerships and responsible action. ADRA seeks to identify and address social injustice and deprivation in developing countries. The agency's work seeks to improve the quality of life of those in need. ADRA invests in the potential of these individuals through community development initiatives targeting Food Security, Economic Development, Primary Health and Basic Education. ADRA's emergency management initiatives provide aid to disaster survivors.
