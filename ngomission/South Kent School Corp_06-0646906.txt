South Kent School, established in 1923 as a college preparatory school for boys in grades 9 through 12, provides its students with the intellectual, moral, physical and social framework for scholastic achievement in college and productive citizenship in adult society. At the core of the mission are the school's founding values, simplicity of life, self-reliance and directness of purpose, and a unique integrated curriculum designed for today's adolescent boys. Rigorous academics are balanced by athletics, a strong arts program, extracurricular activities, and community service. Since its founding, South Kent has maintained ties with the Episcopal Church. Three principles define the School: simplicity of life, self-reliance, and directness of purpose.
