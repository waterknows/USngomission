Since 1983, Shepherd's Table has been a necessary and effective resource welcoming and serving those in need in Silver Spring. Our mission is to provide help to people who are homeless or in need by providing basic services, including meals, social services, medical support, clothing, and other assistance in an effective and compassionate manner. Shepherd's Table offers a wide range of services. From our Clothes Closet, which allows individuals and families to select from among our donated clothing items each week, to our Resource Center, which is open every day to help homeless people collect mail, make phone calls, or receive assistance with Social Services, to MobileMed, Montgomery County's mobile medical facility our organization continues to meet the fundamental needs of the community.
