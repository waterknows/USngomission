The Vanderburgh Humane Society (VHS) was founded in 1957 to provide protection for homeless animals, intervention for animals in abusive environments, and community education to encourage prevention of animal abuse and pet overpopulation. The VHS serves as a surrender and adoption agency for unwanted pets. In addition to finding homes for animals, the VHS also works to build public awareness of the problem of homeless and abandoned pets. Through special events, media coverage and other outreach activities we hope to reduce the flow of animals to our shelter. VHS is committed to the elimination of pet overpopulation in our community, the prevention of animal cruelty and neglect, and the promotion of the animal-human bond.
