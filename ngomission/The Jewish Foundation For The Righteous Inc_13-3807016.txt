The Jewish Foundation for the Righteous (JFR) was established in 1986 to fulfill the traditional Jewish commitment to hakarot hatov, the searching out and recognition of goodness. JFR provides financial assistance to aged and needy non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust. In addition to providing needed financial assistance to rescuers each month, the Foundation has a national Holocaust education program. The goal of the program is to educate middle and high school teachers about the history of the Holocaust and to provide them with the resources to integrate this knowledge into their classrooms.
