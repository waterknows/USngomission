Cultural Survival was founded in response to the opening up of the Amazonian and South American hinterlands during the 1960s, and the drastic effects this had on indigenous inhabitants. It has since worked with indigenous communities in Asia, Africa, South America, North America, and Australia, becoming the leading US-based organization defending the rights of indigenous peoples around the world. Our efforts are guided by a board of directors that includes some of the world's preeminent indigenous leaders, as well as anthropologists, philanthropists, and entrepreneurs, and our executive director is a renowned human rights lawyer. Headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Cultural Survival also has a satellite office for our Guatemala Radio Project in Guatemala.
