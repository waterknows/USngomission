The Trenton Area Soup Kitchen (TASK) was founded in the early 1980's by a small group of individuals from local churches and service organizations. Their goal was to feed the truly needy people of Trenton five days a week. TASK is a non-sectarian organization whose mission is to feed those who are hungry in the Trenton area and offer programs to encourage self-sufficiency and improve the quality of life of its patrons. TASK provides more than 4,000 free and nutritious meals per week. We direct our activities toward helping patrons achieve healthier lifestyles, increased self-esteem, and self-sufficiency.
