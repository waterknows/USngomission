Blue Water Baltimore's mission is to restore the quality of Baltimore's rivers, streams and harbor to foster a healthy environment, a strong economy, and thriving communities. We work towards a future when our neighborhood streams are safe for fishing and swimming and our clean harbor is the pride of our city. To achieve our mission, we mobilize volunteers to monitor our streams for pollution. We organize trash cleanups, plant trees on public land and provide a helping hand to property owners who want to do their part to reduce polluted runoff from their properties. We advocate for stronger laws for clean water, both locally and state-wide.
