The ministry that is now known as Martha O'Bryan Center began in 1894, when Miss Martha O'Bryan organized The Gleaners Society at First Presbyterian Church, Nashville to assist her in delivering food, clothing and furniture to families in need. On a foundation of Christian faith, the Martha O'Bryan Center empowers children, youth, and adults in poverty to transform their lives through work, education, employment and fellowship. Martha O'Bryan Center services are targeted to the 1,856 residents who live in 720 apartments in the James A. Cayce Homes, Nashville's oldest and largest public housing development, as well as residents of surrounding East Nashville neighborhoods. Joining Martha O'Bryan Center in service to the families of East Nashville is the CWA-Cayce Learning Center, which serves families in Cayce and the CWA Plaza Apartments.
