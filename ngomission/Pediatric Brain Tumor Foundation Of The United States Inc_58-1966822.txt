Founded in 1991, Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation (PBTF) seeks to find the cause and cure of brain tumors in children by supporting medical research, increasing public awareness of the disease and aiding in early detection and treatment of childhood brain tumors. As the world's largest non-governmental source of funding for childhood brain tumor research, we're dedicated to not only eradicating this disease, but to providing support to families. We provide educational and emotional support for children and families affected by this life-threatening disease.
