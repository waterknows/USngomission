Apartment Life is who we are, and the CARES program is what we provide to the apartment industry. The CARES program is a community building and resident retention program that provides business value to apartment owners and management companies while making a lasting difference in the lives of apartment residents. Apartment Life works with the management team to build community and serve residents by doing things that flow naturally out of the Christian lifestyle - welcoming new residents, planning social events, and CARE-ing in times of need. Our teams have been compared to campus RA's, first responders, Mom and Dad, life of the party, and even the heartbeat of the community.
