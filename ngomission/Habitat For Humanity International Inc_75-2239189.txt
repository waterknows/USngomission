Trinity Habitat for Humanity revitalizes neighborhoods by building quality, affordable homes and rehabbing 

existing homes with volunteer labor and donations of money and materials. Sponsors and donors underwrite 

construction costs of Habitat for Humanity homes. Partner families, as Habitat for Humanity homeowners are 

known, invest "sweat equity" in the construction of their homes or others' houses, working side by side with 

volunteers. Partner families make affordable monthly payments on a no-interest mortgage held by Habitat. 

Trinity Habitat for Humanity has built over 444 new homes and preserved more than 513 existing homes in 

Tarrant, Johnson, Parker and Wise counties since 1989.
