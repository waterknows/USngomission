Children's Oncology Services, Inc. believes that a diagnosis of cancer should not prevent a child from experiencing the simple joys of childhood. Through our One Step programs, we offer camp experiences and other programs throughout the year that allow children with cancer to just be kids. Our programs offer fun, friendship and support in a safe and nurturing environment. Through the magic of childhood experiences, we help kids diagnosed with cancer reclaim their lives.
