Founded in 1999, Farmers and Hunters Feeding the Hungry (FHFH) is an outreach ministry of the people of God called upon to feed venison to the hungry among us nationwide. Many of the growing number of deer and other big game in America are being discarded. Farmers and hunters deliver this harvested surplus deer and other big game to participating meat processors. Donations from churches, clubs, businesses and individuals cover the costs of processing, packaging and freezing the meat. The frozen meat is then available free of cost for pick-up by a nearby food bank or feeding program. This nutritious, low fat, high protein meat is then distributed and/or cooked by hundreds of community agencies.
