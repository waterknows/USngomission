The mission of the Jewish Community Federation of Greater Rochester is to enrich the quality of life for Jews in Rochester, Israel and around the world. The Federation meets this goal through financial resource development, planning, education, community relations, and volunteer recruitment and training. The Federation convenes agencies, synagogues, and organizations to address issues of common concern. Together, we transform Jewish tradition and values into action. The Rochester Federation's annual campaign supports five beneficiary agencies locally, Federation operations, and social and humanitarian programs and services in Israel and around the world.
