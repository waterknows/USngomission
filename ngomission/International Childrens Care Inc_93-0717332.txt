Founded in 1978, International Children's Care (ICC) is a private relief and development organization. Caring individuals, with no interest in personal gain, established ICC for the specific purpose of giving high quality care for needy children. ICC fulfills this primary directive of its charter without regard to the children's ethnic, political, or religious association. The ICC philosophy is that each child should grow up in a real home environment. Each child's unique circumstances determines how ICC applies this philosophy. If it is not possible for the child to live with its birth parents, ICC places the child in a loving, natural family unit. This may be a home on an ICC facility or an adoptive home.
