Founded in 1943, the United Way - Thomas Jefferson Area serves community members with the greatest need or at the greatest risk in ways that make our entire community a better place to live for the long term. We focus on the following four impact areas: successful kids in strong families; achieving self-sufficiency; access to health and wellness; and strengthening community. People of all income levels in our community receive services through the programs funded by the United Way, such as: dependent care assistance; help for the elderly and disabled, or homeless individuals with families; family counseling; disaster/ emergency assistance; and other services.
