The philosophy of Meals-on-Wheels is simple. Emphasis is placed on individuals versus numbers; communities as opposed to governmental boundaries; and timely services versus waiting lists. Meals-on-Wheels of Johnson and Ellis Counties is a community-based organization that serves needy elderly and disabled persons throughout Johnson and Ellis Counties. Founded in 1977, the organization currently serves a two-county service area that covers over 1,700 square miles.
