MOSI (Museum of Science and Industry) is a community-based institution and educational resource that is dedicated to advancing public interest, knowledge, and understanding of science, industry, and technology. Originally founded as a youth museum in 1962, MOSI today is the result more than 50 years of growth and maturity reflecting both the institution and the surrounding community. The passage of time has seen MOSI change in name, location, and size. However, its general purpose, that of providing informal science education, has remained essentially unchanged. MOSI's core ideology is to make a difference in people's lives by making science real for people of all ages and backgrounds. The MOSI science center complex is the largest in the southeast and the fifth largest in the U.S.
