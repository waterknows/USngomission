Established in 1938, the Palm Springs Art Museum has become the center of the desert's art community. What began as a museum about the desert has evolved into an oasis for the arts. The Museum's permanent collection of more than 55,000 objects features art of the Americas and 20th-century California art. The collection includes modernist and contemporary painting and sculpture, Western American art, Native American and Mesoamerican art and artifacts, contemporary studio glass art, photography, modern architecture and design, and graphics/works on paper. The Annenberg Theater offers an eclectic calendar of performances from ballet to modern dance, opera to jazz, Broadway cabaret to classical music, comedy to drama.
