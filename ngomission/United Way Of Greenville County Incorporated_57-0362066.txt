United Way of Greenville County's mission is to provide leadership in uniting our community to improve people's lives and build a vital and caring community. We aim to be the most vital, caring community in America - a community where we nurture all young children, all youth succeed, all families and neighborhoods are strong, all people live healthier lives, and all neighbors in crisis receive care. Our funded programs span five general focus areas: children, families, health, youth, and crisis.
