United Way has been active in Cleveland County since 1952 when it was formed as the Cleveland County United Fund. The United Fund served seven local agencies. Today, the United Way has grown to include 30 local human care programs at our 24 partner agencies. These programs serve thousands of Cleveland County residents annually. 

In order for United Way to be a leader in strengthening our community's ability to impact its own problems, there must be a collaborative effort to determine our community's most critical social needs.

 

By identifying our human service needs and working as a united force with every citizen of Cleveland County, we can create opportunities for a better life in Cleveland County.
