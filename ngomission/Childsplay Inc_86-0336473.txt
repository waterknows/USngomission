Founded in 1977, Childsplay is a professional non-profit theatre company of adult actors, performing for young

audiences and families. Childsplay's mission is to create theatre so strikingly original in form, content or both, that it instills in young people an enduring awe, love and respect for the medium, thus preserving imagination and wonder, those hallmarks of childhood which are the keys to the future. In addition to our weekend public performances, we also offer three theatre experiences for our school audiences: field trips, school tours and artist in residence programs.
