Founded in 1844, the Boston Latin School Association (BLSA) exists to preserve and support the mission and excellence of the Boston Latin School, to build and maintain relationships among its alumni and friends, to raise funds for both school and Association activities. BLSA grants are designed primarily to supplement the funding of programs in technology, language arts, music, drama, and athletics at the Boston Latin School. BLSA grants are also designed to fund college scholarships for the students at the Boston Latin School.
