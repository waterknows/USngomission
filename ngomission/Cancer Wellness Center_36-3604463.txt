The Cancer Wellness Center was founded in 1989 to help people live better while living with cancer. We help people feel more connected by becoming part of a comfortable community of people who understand, because they are going through it too. We deal with the very real emotional issues that cancer can cause by offering trained, experienced counseling and support. We nurture mind, body and spirit with programs that offer simple exercises, stress relief, healthy diets, relaxing activities, and meaningful conversations. In addition, we offer an extensive library of books, tapes and videos, and involve discussions with other participants.
