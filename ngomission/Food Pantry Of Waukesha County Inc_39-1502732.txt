The Food Pantry of Waukesha County provides food, hope, and dignity to county residents in need, and advocates to increase awareness of hunger in the community through collaborative action. We distribute food based on nutritional guidelines, family size, special dietary needs and availability of provisions. The Food Pantry provides a variety of items from nonperishable food and goods to perishable items like frozen meat, fresh milk and produce. There is also a high demand for baby products, so formula, diapers and hygiene products are available as well.
