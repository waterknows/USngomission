Founded in 1966, Reading Is Fundamental (RIF) prepares and motivates children to read by delivering free books and literacy resources to those children and families who need them most. RIF's highest priority is reaching underserved children from birth to age eight. Through community volunteers in every state and U.S. territory, RIF provides millions of children with approximately 4 million new, free books and literacy resources each year. All RIF programs combine three essential elements to foster children's literacy: reading motivation, family and community involvement, and the excitement of choosing free books to keep.
