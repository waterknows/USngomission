The Christmas Box International's mission is inspired by the book The Christmas Box, the spirit and message of which symbolize the beauty and importance of love for children. The Christmas Box International partners with local and international communities and groups to prevent child abuse and to improve the quality of life for children who have been abused or neglected. Each Christmas Box House serves as a one-stop assessment center for abused and neglected children, from infants through children at the age of 18. Children in our care receive mental, emotional, and physical care in a home-like, loving environment.
