Established in 1978, the mission of the Arizona Community Foundation is to lead, serve and collaborate to mobilize enduring philanthropy for a better Arizona. With regional affiliates across the state, ACF is a family of charitable funds supported by thousands of Arizonans. Funds are established for the common good or for special purposes, and grants are awarded annually in the areas of health and human services; education; community and economic development; animal welfare and the environment; law, justice and public safety; and scientific research.
