In December 2000, the American Friends of Cambridge University and the Cambridge University Development Office in the United States merged to form one foundation, Cambridge in America (CAm). CAm is the alumni, development and communications center for the American constituents of Cambridge University and its 31 member colleges. CAm helps Cambridge alumni stay current with the University and their colleges, builds a community of alumni and friends throughout the United States, and facilitates major benefactions that help Cambridge achieve excellence in teaching and research, maintain its unique learning environment, and ensure access to the most able students.
