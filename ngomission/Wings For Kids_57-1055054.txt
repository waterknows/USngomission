WINGS for kids (WINGS) is an education program that teaches kids how to behave well, make good decisions and build healthy relationships. We do this by weaving a comprehensive social and emotional learning curriculum into a fresh and fun after school program. Kids get the life lessons they need to succeed and to be happy, and they get a safe place to call home after school.Since opening in Charleston, SC, in 1996, WINGS has grown to serve more than 5,300 kids. Programs are currently located in Atlanta, GA; Charleston, SC; Charlotte, NC; and Lake City, SC.
