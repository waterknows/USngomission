Victory Ministries of Alaska was established to support the Body of Christ in reaching the lost, to build the faith of Christ's followers, and to equip those seeking to serve God. Victory Bible Camps and Conference Center, located 95 miles northeast of Anchorage, in the Talkeetna Mountains, ministers mainly to the urban population of Anchorage and the Mat-Su Valley (Palmer and Wasilla). Victory Bible Camp has facilities for more than 300 people, located on 389 acres. Camp Li-Wa (Living Water) was started in 1959 and was operated as part of the Denali Bible Church in Fairbanks. Camp Li-Wa, now operated by Victory Ministries, is located just five miles from Fairbanks and ministers in that area.
