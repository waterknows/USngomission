Ave Maria Radio is a listener supported organization that employs broadcast radio, mobile technology and internet streaming to offer news, analysis, teaching, devotions and music to demonstrate the Good News that Jesus is Lord over all areas of life. We show that the teaching of Christ, through His Church, offers a rational view of the world, a deep sense of spirituality, a firm family life, enhanced human relationships, and the creation of a culture of life and love.
