In December 2012, KCET-the nation's largest independent public television station-and Link TV-the first independent, national television network dedicated to providing Americans with global perspectives on news, events and culture-merged to form KCETLink. KCETLink is a national, independent viewer supported 501(c)(3) media organization that provides high- quality, culturally diverse programming designed to engage the public in innovative, entertaining and transformative ways. With a commitment to independent perspectives, smart global entertainment, local communities, and opportunities for engagement and social action, KCETLink depicts people and the world through a lens that's unavailable elsewhere in U.S. media.
