The mission of Franciscan Outreach is to create an effective, well-managed, sustainably-funded organization that provides shelter, food and help in building a better life and affirms the human dignity of people in need in the Chicago Area.As one of the largest agencies caring for the homeless of Chicago, we recognize that shelters resolve homelessness on a temporary basis. Through excellent casework and partnerships with other organizations, like Rush University's Community Service Initiatives Program and the Chicago Alliance to End Homelessness, Franciscan Outreach transitions hundreds of homeless individuals into permanent housing each year, in addition to the daily provision of more than 300 beds and more than 700 meals.
