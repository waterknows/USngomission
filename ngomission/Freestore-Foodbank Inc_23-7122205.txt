The Freestore Foodbank was founded in 1971, and serves about 160,000 people in southern Ohio, northern Kentucky and southeastern Indiana. The Freestore Foodbank has two divisions, Client Services and the Foodbank. We provide food and services, create stability and further self-reliance for people in crisis. We distribute donated and surplus food to 450 non-profit agencies in 20 counties across three states, who in turn help prevent hunger in their own neighborhoods. In short, we want to make sure that families aren't forced to choose between buying food and paying rent, taking a sick child to the doctor, or repairing the car used to drive to work.
