The Southwest School of Art works to teach, preserve, and advance the visual arts. We expand the creative potential of our community and connect cultures of the world through participatory learning experience. An additional part of our mission is to preserve the former Ursuline Convent and Academy as a place of historic significance. The Southwest School of Art is a nationally-recognized leader in arts education, currently offering studio programs for more than 4,000 adults, children and teens annually on its campus. The school also organizes contemporary art exhibitions, and houses a small history museum, and a lunch caf√©.
