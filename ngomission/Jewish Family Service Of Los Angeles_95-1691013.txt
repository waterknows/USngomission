Since 1854, the Jewish Family Service of Los Angeles (JFS) has provided vital services to people of all ages, ethnicities and religions. JFS' nationally recognized programs provide personal growth opportunities for people of all ages, counsel families and individuals, support the elderly and the recent immigrant, house the homeless and abused, and feed the hungry. From support groups for all ages, to activities for the developmentally disabled to exercise and wellness programs for seniors to programs for children and teens to support for families dealing with illness, to programs with synagogues and local schools, JFS serves more than 60,000 people every year.
