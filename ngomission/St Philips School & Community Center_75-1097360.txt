The goal of St. Philip's School and Community Center is to provide each student with an exceptional academic experience tailored to suit the individual needs of the student. St. Philip's accepts students of varying abilities and backgrounds, recognizing each child as a gift from God and a unique creation entitled to love, respect, and opportunities for a safe and challenging passage through the elementary school years. The school's varied instructional techniques enhance and develop the unique learning style of each child and aim to instill and strengthen those qualities that promote a secure and responsible adult life. From its beginnings as a daycare center in 1967, St. Philip's School now serves over 240 students from three years through the sixth grade.
