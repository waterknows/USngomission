Founded in 1973, The Royal Oak Foundation is the United States affiliate of The National Trust of England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Royal Oak raises funds for the conservation of historic properties including houses and gardens in Britain and elsewhere and sponsors educational programs which address issues in conservation and preservation. Royal Oak offers lecture programs which address the topics of art, architecture, collections, garden and landscape design, social history and conservation and preservation. Royal Oak also sponsors a biennial competition in the Architectural Arts and promotes scholarship through ICOMOS, Attingham Summer School and now the Damaris Horan Prize Landscape History Fellowship.
