The National Hemophilia Foundation (NHF) is dedicated to finding better treatments and cures for bleeding and clotting disorders and preventing the complications of these disorders through education, advocacy and research. Established in 1948, the National Hemophilia Foundation has chapters throughout the country. NHF awards grants to fund innovative research aimed at finding better treatments and cures for bleeding and clotting disorders. This research has led to vital insights into improved factor replacement therapies, more accurate hemophilia diagnostic methods, and a greater understanding of the genetic basis of hemophilia. Our broad range of programs and services include the National Prevention Program, and Project Red Flag.
