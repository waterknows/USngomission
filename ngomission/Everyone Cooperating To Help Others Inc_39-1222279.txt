Created in late 1969, ECHO (Everyone Cooperating to Help Others) serves low-income individuals and families in the Janesville area. ECHO has grown from being a food pantry and clothing depot to being a charity organization called upon to help meet temporary housing, food, transportation and other emergency needs for low-income families. ECHO seeks to help people help themselves through its programs and services, not readily available through other sources, and to assist them in utilizing other existing services and programs in the community.
