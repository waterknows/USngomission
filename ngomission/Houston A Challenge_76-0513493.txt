The mission of The Houston A+ Challenge is to promote an academically rich and purposeful education for more of our children and to demonstrate how such an education could become possible for all our children. We do this by investing in people, through initiatives that coach teachers and school leaders to acquire the skills they need to help students of diverse backgrounds succeed academically, professionally and socially. Houston A+ has supported public school improvement in the Houston area since 1997. Houston A+ Challenge initiatives are guided by three imperatives: we promote personalization of classrooms and working communities; we facilitate networks and relationships, so that parents, educators, communities and the business sector can work in collaboration to improve schools; and we focus on teaching and learning, by training educators to assess diverse learning styles and select effective teaching strategies to reach each student.
