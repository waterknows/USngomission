We fight hunger by gathering and distributing food, engaging in partnerships that advance self-sufficiency and by providing community leadership on issues related to hunger.Community Food Bank sits at the center of a network of 180 partner agencies who, along with our innovative direct services, help us distribute food to 190,000 hungry people every month right here in our community. This year we will serve nearly 25 million pounds of food.
