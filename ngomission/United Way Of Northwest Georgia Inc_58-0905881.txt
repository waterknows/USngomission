United Way of Northwest Georgia works to improve lives by mobilizing the caring power of our communities in Northwest Georgia. Our vision is to be the preferred organization investing in programs to meet people's needs based on community priorities. United Way has evolved from a force in fundraising, to a community solutions provider - offering information and referral to residents of Northwest Georgia through their 2-1-1 Help Line.
