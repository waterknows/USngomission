Founded in 2000 by Kyle and Pattie Petty, Victory Junction Gang enriches the lives of children with chronic medical conditions or serious illnesses by providing life-changing camping experiences that are exciting, fun, and empowering, in a safe and medically-sound environment. Victory Junction is a year-round camp that serves children, ages 6-16, with a variety of health issues. During the summer, the Camp offers week-long, disease-specific sessions with up to 128 kids per session. During the fall, winter and spring, family weekends are offered with 32 families per weekend. Victory Junction serves children from all areas of the country but primarily sees children from North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia.
