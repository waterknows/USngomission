The North Carolina Justice Center is a research and advocacy organization that works to eliminate poverty in North Carolina by ensuring that every household in the state has access to the resources, services and fair treatment it needs to achieve economic security. Our success in advocating for North Carolina's low-income and marginalized communities stems from our unique five-strategy approach, which enables us to attack problems with the most effective tools. As per this approach, we focus our energies on litigation, public policy advocacy, research, community outreach, and communications.
