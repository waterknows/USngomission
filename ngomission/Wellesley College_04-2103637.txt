Founded in 1870, Wellesley College provides an excellent liberal arts education for women who will make a difference in the world. In some respects, the liberal arts curriculum at Wellesley has changed little since the College was founded. The College is committed to this framework because it emphasizes the essence of education: the ability to speak and write clearly, the knowledge to manage quantitative data with ease, the confidence to approach new material, and the capacity to make critical judgments. These skills are essential whatever the student chooses to do with her life. Wellesley enrolls approximately 2,300 students, has a student to faculty ratio of eight to one, and the average class size ranges from 17 to 20 students.
