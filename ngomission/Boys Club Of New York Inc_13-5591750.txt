Rooted in tradition and history of community service, outreach and philanthropy to some of New York City's most socially and economically troubled neighborhoods, The Boys' Club of New York strives to sustain an environment that nurtures individual talent, strengthens families and promotes strong citizenship while fostering a passion for learning. Established in 1876, The Boys' Club of New York encourages participants to seek the highest standards of scholarship, moral development and physical achievement. Working closely with our membership and their families, our professional staff encourages the emotional, social, physical, educational and vocational growth of the agency's entire membership and extended family.
