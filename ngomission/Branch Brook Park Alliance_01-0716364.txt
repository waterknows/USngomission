Branch Brook Park Alliance (BBPA) is a public/private partnership organized in 1999 to provide design expertise and funding support to help Essex County restore and revitalize the park. Projects already completed by the partnership - new ball fields, extensive cherry tree plantings and restoration of historic park sites - set the stage for complete renewal. Today, Essex County Branch Brook Park hosts special annual events, sports and concerts. Like the park's renowned annual Cherry Blossom Festival, these activities attract thousands.
