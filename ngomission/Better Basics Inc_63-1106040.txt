Better Basics' mission is to make a positive difference in the lives of children and their families by advancing literacy through enrichment and intervention programs. Incorporated in 1994, we currently provide our services to 52 schools in Birmingham and surrounding school systems. During the 2013-2014 school year, Better Basics reached roughly 24,000 children and parents, gave away over 41,000 books to at-risk children, and provided enrichment programs to 14,000 students.
