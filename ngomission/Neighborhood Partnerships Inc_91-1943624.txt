Neighborhood Partnerships creates opportunity for low-income people. We build and manage strong partnerships that fuel change and progress in our community. Each year, we have impact on the lives of thousands of Oregonians through high profile collaborations and initiatives and through nurturing leaders. We create opportunity for low income people where they live - in their neighborhoods both urban and rural. And all of what we do we is based on the strength of our partnership with community leaders, with other organizations, with governments, and with funders and contributors. Our programs and initiatives are designed to help us achieve the three core goals identified by the strategic planning process we undertook in 2005: build thriving communities, end homelessness and support successful residents, and create economic stability.
