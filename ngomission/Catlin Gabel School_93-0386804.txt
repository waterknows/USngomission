Catlin Gabel School is Portland's nationally recognized progressive independent day school for students from preschool through twelfth grade. In 1957, The Catlin Hillside School and Gabel Country Day School merged to become the Catlin Gabel School. Gabel Country Day's roots date back to 1859 and The Portland Academy. Catlin Hillside School originated as Miss Catlin's School in 1911. The Catlin Gabel School supports inspired learning, leading to responsible action through dedicated teaching, caring relationships, a challenging curriculum, and community service. We value each person's effort, imagination, and positive contributions to the community. We celebrate being inclusive as well as the partnership between family and school.
