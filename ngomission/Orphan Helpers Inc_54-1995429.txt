The mission of Orphan Helpers is to serve and minister to the physical, spiritual, emotional, and educational needs of orphaned, abused and incarcerated children by effectively partnering with individuals, churches, businesses, organizations and governments. Orphan Helpers is a multi-denominational Christian ministry working in government-run orphanages and detention centers in El Salvador and Honduras. The children we serve have been denied by their own families, passed over by private orphanages, and rejected by society as a whole. Orphan Helpers hires native teachers and workers in the centers and also sends mission teams to Central America to serve these children from within the local communities.
