Founded in 1967, the Stroud Water Research Center seeks to advance our global knowledge and stewardship of fresh water ecosystems through rigorous research, education and public outreach. Driven by the philosophy that understanding the science of fresh water is fundamental to our ability to protect the integrity of this finite and vital resource, the Center seeks to disseminate its research findings to its peers in the scientific and educational communities, as well as businesses, landowners, policy makers and individuals, to enable informed decision making that affects water quality and availability in our local communities and the world around us. We accomplish our goals through our pursuit of both basic and applied scientific research, as well as through educational programs for all ages.
