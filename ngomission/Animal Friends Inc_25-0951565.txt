Animal Friends, a premier companion animal resource center, is committed to nurturing and promoting the animal-human bond and creating a community where our relationship with companion animals is guided by compassion. Our mission is to ensure the well being of companion animals, while ending overpopulation, abuse and unwarranted euthanasia. It is our vision to: reduce the number of unwanted animals through aggressive spay/neuter programs; provide for the well-being of companion animals in need, while adhering to our no-kill tradition, and find each a lifelong, loving home; promote the animal-human bond through education and outreach programs; and act as an advocate on behalf of animals in crisis and as an enforcer of their rights and protection.
