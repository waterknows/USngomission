Planned Parenthood Hudson Peconic (PPHP) works to empower individuals to determine their own sexual health and reproductive futures. PPHP's role is to provide exceptional health services, accurate information and education, and fearless advocacy for reproductive rights and justice. We believe it is the right and responsibility of every individual to make her/his own reproductive health decisions. We believe in universal and unfettered access to confidential, respectful, high-quality reproductive healthcare for all individuals, regardless of their economic status, age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, religion, or geographic location. We believe that all individuals deserve the opportunity to benefit from honest and accurate sexuality education.
