The Parkinson's Unity Walk (PUW), a grassroots organization, began in 1994 through the dedicated efforts of patients, families, support groups, and friends who were affected by Parkinson's disease. Their main goal was to raise awareness and funds for research to find a cure for Parkinson's. Over the last eighteen years, the Unity Walk has grown from 200 participants in the first event to over to 10,000 participants in the 2012 Walk. The funds raised for the Walk have also dramatically increased with each passing year. In 1994, the Unity Walk raised $16,000 in research funds, and in 2012 over $1,800,000 was raised for Parkinson's research. Over $12,000,000 has been raised since the Walk's inception.
