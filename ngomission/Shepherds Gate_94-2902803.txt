Since 1984, Shepherd's Gate has provided Christ-centered services and housing to over 11,000 battered and homeless women and children. Our mission at Shepherd's Gate is to meet the practical, spiritual, and emotional needs of battered and homeless women and children through the love of Jesus Christ, equipping them to lead a life of faith, hope, and love and to reach out to others in His name. We provide a safe haven for women and their children who are homeless because of abusive relationships, addictions, loss of financial support and other factors. We operate two campuses in the United States - one in Livermore, California, and one in Brentwood, California - as well as a thrift store in Livermore, California.
