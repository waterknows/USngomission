Sustainable South Bronx (SSBx) works to address economic and environmental issues in the South Bronx - and throughout New York City - through a combination of green job training, community greening programs, and social enterprise. Founded in 2001, SSBx began out of a desire to advocate for parks and green development in the South Bronx and to promote environmental justice in a neighborhood that has borne, and continues to bear, a heavy environmental burden for the rest of the city.
