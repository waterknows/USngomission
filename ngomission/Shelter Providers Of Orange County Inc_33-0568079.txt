HomeAid Orange County is the only community based organization that has successfully developed 50 building and renovating housing projects (with a value of over $50 million) across the entire homeless Continuum of Care spectrum, providing facilities that range from emergency shelters, to transitional housing, to permanent supportive housing. Through over twenty five local service providers, HomeAid's housing developments offer support services designed to assist the homeless as they move toward self-sufficiency; such programs include education, job skills training, physical and emotional support. HomeAid's activities in Orange County have allowed service providers to significantly grow in their organizational capacity and to build successful programs impacting people's lives. As a result of the facilities that have been developed, these service providers are now in a greater position to carry out their mission and vision giving children and youth an opportunity to succeed.
