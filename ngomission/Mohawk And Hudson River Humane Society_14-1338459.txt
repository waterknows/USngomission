The Mohawk Hudson Humane Society (MHHS) has provided shelter for lost, abused and unwanted animals since 1887. The Society is the oldest and largest animal protection organization in New York's Capital Region, receiving an average of over 6,000 animals per year. We work to improve the lives of homeless and abused animals through sheltering, adoption, education and advocacy, as well as the prevention of animal cruelty. We envision a community in which it is unacceptable to neglect, abuse or abandon animals; in which homeless animals will be given refuge in an appropriate facility; and that ensures every adoptable animal finds a home.
