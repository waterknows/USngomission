The mission of the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) is to protect and enhance America's National Parks for present and future generations. Established in 1919, NPCA is an independent, nonpartisan voice working to address major threats facing the National Park System. We advocate for the national parks and the National Park Service; educate decision-makers and the public about the importance of preserving the parks; help to convince members of Congress to uphold the laws that protect the parks and to support new legislation to address threats to the parks; fight attempts to weaken these laws in the courts; and assess the health of the parks and park management to better inform our advocacy work.
