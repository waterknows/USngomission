CMMB is a leading faith-based NGO improving global health care for the world's poor, by building healthy, sustainable communities through community engagement and partnerships. Now entering its second century, CMMB is committed to integrating and focusing its programming around saving the lives of children and mothers by concentrating on leading causes of mortality in targeted communities throughout Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean. Building around a new CHAMPS (CHildren And Mothers PartnershipS) model, we work at both the community and clinical levels in these targeted communities to strengthen health services and address the leading causes of maternal and child death. In addition, our volunteer program provides medical and business expertise for community development, and we engage with the pharmaceutical industry to help meet the needs of CHAMPS communities and in other areas around the world. For more information on our work in the developing world and how we're working toward building a world in which every human life is valued and quality healthcare is available to all, please visit www.cmmb.org or email us at info@cmmb.org.
