Founded in 1989, Rebuilding Together Peninsula's (RTP) mission is to build volunteer partnerships to rehabilitate homes and community facilities for low-income homeowners and neighbors - seniors, disabled, or families - so they can live independently in warmth and safety. Of the over one million residents that RTP serves in San Mateo and northern Santa Clara counties, over 94,000 are low-income homeowners with an average annual income of $12,000. RTP is neighbor helping neighbor - people helping people - one community at a time.
