The Flathead Food Bank is a community organization, governed by a volunteer Board of Directors. Daily operations are carried out by our small dedicated staff and our hundreds of caring volunteers! Our mission is to provide temporary, emergency food assistance to those in need. Our main purpose is to serve as a food collection and distribution system. We also voluntarily participate in two programs that serve, and/or deliver government commodities to seniors and children on a monthly basis.
