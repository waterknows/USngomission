Founded in 1929, the Potter League for Animals is dedicated to making a difference in the lives of animals. To promote the humane treatment of all animals, we shelter and care for lost or unwanted companion animals, return them to their homes, place them into humane environments, or sensitively euthanize them. Through community education and the fostering of relationships between people and animals, we secure their future. Potter League for Animals is committed to zero tolerance of animal suffering and homelessness. As the heart of a humane community, we will lead an empowered citizenry who are the animals' best advocates. Together we will act with courage and compassion to address the root causes of animal abuse and overpopulation.
