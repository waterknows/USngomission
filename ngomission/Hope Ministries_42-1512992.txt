Hope Ministries has been serving those who are homeless in Des Moines and central Iowa since 1915. We are a Christ-centered, faith-based ministry that provides programs and services for homeless and hungry men, women and children. We are one of the largest non-denominational collaborative efforts in Iowa focused on homelessness and hunger issues. We reach out to the unsheltered and displaced by offering food, clothing, shelter and support through emergency and long-term recovery services.
