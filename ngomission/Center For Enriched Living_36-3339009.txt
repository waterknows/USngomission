Founded in 1968, The Center for Enriched Living exists so that people with developmental disabilities can be fully included in the community, achieve personal success, and enjoy a good quality of life. We see a future where every person with a developmental disability is an equal, valued and contributing member of the community. At CEL, we provide opportunities for our members – the people who come to CEL – to make new friends, have fun and acquire new skills for social inclusion and independent living. And because 84% of our members are at or below the federal poverty level, we keep our fees low and offer scholarships for all programs!
