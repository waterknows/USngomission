United Way of Kern County focus is on Education, Income, and Health. These are the building blocks for a good quality of life. United Way of Kern County is leading a movement to improve community conditions by helping local people become financially stable and independent. A quality education leads to a stable job, enough income to support a family through retirement, and good health. We bring stakeholders together to generate philanthropy from all segments of our community, marshal resources, forge community consensus, and build coalitions and partnerships. The combined result is far greater than the sum of each individual component.
