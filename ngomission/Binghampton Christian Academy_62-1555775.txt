Binghampton Christian Academy (BCA) is a Pre-kindergarten through Eighth grade Christian school for children who need more love and hope. Most come from the Binghampton community with the largest number coming from housing projects near the school. BCA works to be an instrument of God to bring the hope that is in Jesus Christ to the children of Binghampton and their families by seeking to lead them to Him as we nurture them spiritually, mentally, and physically so that they may become productive, self-supporting, and godly citizens.
