Established in 1986, the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) is a nonpartisan think thank that seeks to broaden the discussion about economic policy to include the interests of low- and middle-income workers. EPI was the first -and remains the premier - organization to focus on the economic condition of low- and middle-income Americans and their families. Its careful research on the status of American workers has become the gold standard in that field. EPI's staff includes eight Ph.D.-level researchers, a half dozen policy analysts and research assistants, and a full communications and outreach staff. EPI also works closely with a national network of prominent scholars. The institute conducts original research according to strict standards of objectivity, and couples its findings with outreach and popular education.
