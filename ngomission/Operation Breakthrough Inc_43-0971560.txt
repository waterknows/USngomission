The mission of Operation Breakthrough is to help children who are living in poverty develop to their fullest potential by providing them a safe, loving and educational environment. Operation Breakthrough also strives to support and empower the children's families through advocacy, referral services and emergency aid. The program began in 1971 with 50 infants, toddlers and preschoolers at 31st and Paseo. In 1976, it expanded to include before- and after-school care. The Center moved to its current location at 31st and Troost in 1981. Since that time, it has added a broad range of social services to meet the needs of the children and their families and in 2006 completed a $13 million facility expansion that increased our licensed capacity. Today, we serve 266 children (0-5 years) in our Early Childhood Education program; 110 school-age children (5 - 13 years) in Before/After-School and Summer programming; and the children's 205+ parents through a broad range of support services.
