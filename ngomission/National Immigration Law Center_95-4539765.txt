Established in 1979, the National Immigration Law Center (NILC) is the only national legal advocacy organization in the U.S. exclusively dedicated to defending and advancing the rights and opportunities of low-income immigrants and their families. Over the past 34 years, NILC has won landmark legal decisions protecting fundamental rights, thwarted policies that would have devastated the well-being of low-income immigrants and their family members, and advanced policies that reinforce and promote equality, opportunity, and justice for all. NILC uses multiple strategies to advance its mission, including policy analysis, litigation, advocacy, communications, and education. Advocates across the country rely on NILC's unique ability to employ these integrated approaches in its work, and provide them with the tools and information they need to shape their own advocacy efforts.
