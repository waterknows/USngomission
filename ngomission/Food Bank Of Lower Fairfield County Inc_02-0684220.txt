The Food Bank of Lower Fairfield County is lower Fairfield County's primary hunger-relief organization. We provide food to over 70 non-profit agencies and programs that serve low income people in our six town service area through bags of groceries and congregate meals. These include soup kitchens, food pantries, child care programs, homeless shelters, senior centers, domestic violence safe houses, and rehabilitation programs. The Food Bank of Lower Fairfield County also seeks to also raise awareness of, and promote action to combat, hunger in these communities.
