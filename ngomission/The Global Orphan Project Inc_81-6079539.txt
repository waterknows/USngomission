The Global Orphan Project, Inc. (GO Project) is a global orphan care ministry whose mission is to transform lives through orphan care. The GO Project was formed in 2003 to provide shelter and care for the basic needs and positive development of orphaned and impoverished children and their communities in some of the poorest areas of the world. The GO Project has three operating divisions: domestic and international orphan care whereby GO Project works with local churches to help provide family based care for orphans, trips into the Orphan Window, and an impact investment fund called GO Fund that supports vocational training centers, business ventures and agricultural ventures, and whose proceeds raised pay for basic orphan care costs.
