The Sonoran Institute inspires and enables community decisions and public policies that respect the land and people of western North America. Founded in 1990, we work across the rapidly changing West to conserve and restore natural and cultural assets and to promote better management of growth and change. The Institute's community-based approach emphasizes collaboration, civil dialogue, sound information, local knowledge, practical solutions and big-picture thinking. Our scientists, planners, researchers, conservation advocates, facilitators and the rest of the staff are passionate about working toward a West with healthy landscapes, resilient economies and vibrant communities where conservation and prosperity go hand-in-hand.
