Spence-Chapin Services to Families and Children is an accredited agency that has been offering quality adoption services since 1908. Our mission is to find adoptive homes for children in need here and in countries around the world. Today, Spence-Chapin is proud of our role as a prominent voice and leading advocate for adoption, and of our commitment to the well being of all members of the adoption triad: birth parents, adoptive parents, and their children.
