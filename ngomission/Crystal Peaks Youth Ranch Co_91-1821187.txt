Crystal Peaks Youth Ranch (CPYR) exists to Rescue the Equine, Mentor the Child, offer Hope for the Family and Empower the Ministry. They provide a safe and positive experience for children and families to learn about the saving hope of Jesus Christ in an authentic western environment. Currently, Crystal Peaks serves between four to five thousand visitors a year with 25-30 horses rescued from violent abuse or life threatening neglect. Although the primary focus of the ranch is to serve disadvantaged children, the program is available for any child. The only true prerequisite for kids visiting the ranch is that they WANT to participate. A desire to come is an indication of a heart willing to try. It is from this willingness that broken hearts and lives can be lead toward healing.
