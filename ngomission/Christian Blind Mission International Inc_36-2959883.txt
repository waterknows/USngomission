Christian Blind Mission International (CBMI), founded in 1975, is the oldest and largest ministry with the primary purpose of improving the quality of life for the blind and disabled living in the world's most disadvantaged societies. We provide preventative, medical, rehabilitative and educational services to millions of people each year. CBM supports more than 1,000 projects in 113 countries, and our aid is available to all people regardless of religion, nationality, race, or gender. CBM's goal is to find, rescue, and rehabilitate these forgotten peopleâ€”giving children hope, taking whole families and communities out of grinding poverty, and building bridges between them and their communities.
