Here at Granite United Way, we are committed to investing in the areas of the community with the most critical needs - education, income and health. By focusing on these investment initiatives, we are helping people in a new way; we are breaking negative cycles and tackling the root causes of problems to create lasting change. On July 1, 2010, the former United Ways known as Heritage United Way, United Way of Merrimack County, Upper Valley United Way and the North Country United Way officially merged to form Granite United Way. On February 1, 2012 the former United Way of Northern New Hampshire became part of Granite United Way. Inspired by the strength demonstrated in the previous mergers, on January 1, 2013 the former Lakes Region United Way officially joined Granite United Way.
