Founded in 1969, the mission of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Collin County is to enable all young people, especially those who need us most, to reach their full potential as productive, caring, and responsible citizens. The kids are offered an affordable yet safe and nurturing environment and are supported with a variety of programs and activities that assist in their educational, emotional, physical and social development. Children between the ages of 5 and 18 are mentored without regard to social, racial, ethnic or religious background. Learning is disguised as fun and the young people of Collin County are given a valuable opportunity to become independent, productive and influential individuals in the community.
