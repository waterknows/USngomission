Blanchette Rockefeller Neurosciences Institute (BRNI) is dedicated to the study of memory and finding solutions to memory disorders. Our efforts are concentrated on molecular and structural events that record human memory in the brain. The Institute is characterized by a translational science approach, developed in recognition of the disconnect between basic science in laboratory settings and actual clinical treatments. This approach is intended to bridge the gap between fundamental research in memory processes and the development of products and treatments for patients with Alzheimer's disease and other memory impairments by actively promoting the development of important and novel discoveries.
