Founded in 2001, The Ocean Foundation (TOF) is a unique community foundation with a mission to support, strengthen, and promote those organizations dedicated to reversing the trend of destruction of ocean environments around the world. They work with a community of donors who care about the coasts and oceans. In this manner, they grow the financial resources available to support marine conservation in order to promote healthy ocean ecosystems and benefit the human communities that depend on them. TOF increases the capacity of conservation organizations, hosts projects and funds, and supports those working to improve the health of ocean species globally.
