Caritas provides a service continuum for those experiencing poverty that begins with a safety net and links them to resources to achieve self-sufficiency. Caritas offers the homeless, working poor and documented refugees comprehensive services that support their housing stability. Caritas serves hot meals every weekday through our Community Kitchen and take-home groceries through our Pantry to individuals and families in need. As Caritas provides vulnerable individuals with financial assistance, we also equip clients with the knowledge and life skills to manage their finances more effectively through offering education classes on practical topics. Utilizing our business and community contacts, Caritas assists low income individuals and refugees find stable employment to support their self sufficiency.
