United Way of Greater Toledo is a collaboration of community volunteers, health and human-service providers and donors throughout Lucas, Wood and Ottawa counties who are committed to changing lives. United Way assists citizen leaders to develop an agenda to strengthen community life in areas the community most cares about and needs. United Way facilitates and supports a wide range of community-based efforts to make a measurable impact in those areas. Our mission is to change lives by mobilizing the caring power of community. Our focus areas include: preparing children to enter and graduate school, promoting financial stability and workforce development, and improving people's health and wellness.
