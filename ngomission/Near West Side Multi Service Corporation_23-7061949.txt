Founded in 1969 as The Near West Side Multi-Service Corporation, the facility was named the May Dugan Multi Service Center in 1974 to honor the late May Dugan, a long-time resident of the neighborhood who had been a one-person advocate and counselor for her neighbors in need. Today, the Center continues the tradition of its namesake by providing basic and enhanced programming to people that improve their quality of life and, in doing so, strengthen their community. The founders were inspired by President Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty and the mandate of the Kennedy-Johnson Economic Opportunities Act. They made a strong commitment to helping individuals and families become self-sufficient, contributing members of their community. For 43 years, the Center has committed to a comprehensive and caring approach which has proved to be an effective method to help people overcome socio-economic disadvantages.
