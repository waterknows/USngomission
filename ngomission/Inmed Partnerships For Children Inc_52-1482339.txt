Since 1986, INMED Partnerships for Children has worked to rescue children from the immediate and irreversible harm of disease, hunger, abuse, neglect, violence and instability, and to prepare them to shape a brighter future for themselves and the next generation. Through a broad range of health, education, family support, youth development, agriculture and income generation programs, INMED creates opportunities that inspire hope, build self-reliance and encourage community collaboration, making each generation healthier, stronger, and more productive than the last.
