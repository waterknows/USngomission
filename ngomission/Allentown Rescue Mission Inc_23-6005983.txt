For more than a century, the Allentown Rescue Mission has addressed the changing face of homelessness, tackling the root causes of homelessness, and helping to end homelessness one life at a time throughout the Lehigh Valley. Thousands have come to us and received life-changing help throughout the decades. The Mission continues to reinvent itself to address the increasingly complex root causes and issues of homelessness. Many of our clients experience dual-diagnosis; they have both a chemical addiction and some form of mental illness. Staff is educated and experienced, professional and compassionate. For more than 100 years, the Mission has been a place where men have begun to experience restoration with God, their families, and their communities.
