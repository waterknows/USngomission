Since 1925, the Hartford Foundation for Public Giving has quietly helped make good things happen in the Capitol Region of Connecticut. We've been a reliable resource for the local charitable community, including donors, community leaders, and nonprofit organizations of all types and sizes. Over the years, the Hartford Foundation has received gifts from thousands of generous individuals, invested them in a permanent endowment now valued at nearly $570 million, and awarded grants totaling more than $450 million. But the Foundation's role in the community goes well beyond grants to nonprofits. We bring people together to discuss important local issues and to find creative solutions. And, we help donors ensure that their gifts will have maximum impact - now and for generations to come.
