The Children's Clinic (TCC) is a system of licensed community health centers dedicated to providing comprehensive health care in a culturally sensitive and linguistically appropriate manner to ethnically diverse, low-income populations of all life cycles in the Southern California area. TCC was founded by a group of physicians and community leaders in 1939 who recognized the importance of access to health care for all children, particularly those who are from low income families, and are therefore, at risk for health problems. The Clinic has grown from offering weekly well-child care to a daily, full service health care facility with primary care services offered to children, adolescents and adults.
