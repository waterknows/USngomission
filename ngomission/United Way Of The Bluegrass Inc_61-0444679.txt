Everyone deserves opportunities to have a good life: a quality education that leads to a stable job, enough income to support a family through retirement, and good health. That's why United Way's work is focused on the building blocks for a good life:



Education - Helping Children and Youth Achieve Their Potential

Income - Promoting Financial Stability and Independence

Health - Improving People's Health



Advancing the common good is less about helping one person at a time and more about changing systems to help all of us. We are all connected and interdependent. We all win when a child succeeds in school, when families are financially stable, when people are healthy.



United Way's goal is to meet the needs of today while reducing the needs of tomorrow. It's about helping families in crisis now while creating long-lasting changes by addressing the underlying causes to prevent problems before they begin. It takes everyone working together to create a brighter future.
