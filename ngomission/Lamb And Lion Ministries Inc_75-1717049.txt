Lamb & Lion Ministries was founded in 1980 as a non-denominational, independent ministry. The Ministry does not seek to convert people to any particular church. Rather, it seeks to lift up Jesus and draw people to Him as Lord and Savior. The Ministry proclaims its message in a variety of ways. One of the most significant is through its weekly television program called Christ in Prophecy, broadcast nationally. Additionally, the Ministry conducts meetings and seminars all over the country in all kinds of churches. Other forms of outreach include topical teaching videos, books, and a bi-monthly magazine called the Lamplighter. Another form of outreach consists of pilgrimages to Israel which are conducted a few times a year by the Ministry for educational and spiritual purposes.
