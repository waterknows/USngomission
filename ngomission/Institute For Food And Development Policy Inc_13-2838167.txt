The mission of the Institute for Food and Development Policy, better known as Food First, is to end the injustices that cause hunger. Founded in 1975 by Joseph Collins and Frances Moore Lapp√©-author of the revolutionary bestseller Diet for a Small Planet-Food First envisions a world in which all people have access to healthy, ecologically produced and culturally appropriate food. After nearly 40 years of analysis of the global food system, we know that making this vision a reality involves more than technical solutions-it requires political transformation. That's why Food First supports activists, social movements, alliances and coalitions working for systemic change. Our action-oriented research, publications, projects and Food Sovereignty Tours give you the tools to understand the global challenges, build your local movement, and engage with the global movement for food sovereignty.
