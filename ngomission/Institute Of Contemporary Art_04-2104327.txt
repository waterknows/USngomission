The Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) was founded in 1936 as The Boston Museum of Modern Art; in 1948, the museum changed its name to become the ICA. The ICA strives to share the pleasures of reflection, inspiration, provocation, and imagination that contemporary art offers through public access to art, artists, and the creative process. For more than a half century, the ICA has presented contemporary art in all media - visual arts, film, and video, performance and literature - and created educational programs that encourage an appreciation for contemporary culture. Throughout the ICA's history it has been at the fore in identifying and supporting the most important artists of its time and bringing them to public attention.
