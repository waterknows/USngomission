The Urban League of Greater Cleveland (ULGC), a community based nonprofit organization was established in 1917, in response to the needs of families migrating from the South to urban cities in the North. Leveraging its assets as advocate and service provider, the ULGC helped to mitigate the issues of housing discrimination, limited access to employment, and poor landlord-tenant relations. In its 96-year history, the ULGC has delivered upon its mission to enable African Americans and other minority members to develop and exercise their potential on par with all other Americans through education, research, advocacy and provision of services.
