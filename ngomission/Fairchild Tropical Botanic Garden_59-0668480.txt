Founded in 1938 on an 83-acre site south of Miami, Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden works to save tropical plant diversity by exploring, explaining and conserving the world of tropical plants. Fundamental to this task is inspiring a greater knowledge and love for plants and gardening so that all can enjoy the beauty and bounty of the tropical world. Assembling and maintaining an outstanding botanical collection has always been a fundamental part of the institution's existence. The Garden has also emphasized the expansion of plant knowledge through publications, education programs, and research in taxonomy, floristics, conservation biology and ethno-botany. Today, Fairchild is the region's leading source of environmental, horticultural and botanical education.
