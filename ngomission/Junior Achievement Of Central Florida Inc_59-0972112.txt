Junior Achievement of Central Florida (JACF) inspires and prepares young people to succeed in a global economy. We help students make the connection between what they learn in school and what they will need to know for the future. We want every student to be equipped with the right tools to take advantage of the abundant opportunities in this country and worldwide. We offer programs for all grade levels. In these programs, students are made increasingly aware of the economy, develop a solid understanding of business principles and engage in critical self analysis. All of our programs are age appropriate and correlated to Florida state standards. Each of our programs our taught by volunteers from the central Florida region.
