Founded in 1989, the Robert Toigo Foundation's commitment is to bring increased diversity to the finance industry. As a catalyst for change, our programs inspire minority students who might not otherwise have considered finance as their career and provide them with the leadership training, mentoring, tuition assistance and lifelong support they need as they pursue their MBA and launch their finance careers and beyond. Toigo is the only diversity leadership development program focused on the field of finance. Our combination of individualized support to aspiring minority finance professionals and active engagement as a partner with industry helps ensure that the next generation of finance leaders is able to flourish.
