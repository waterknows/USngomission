Founded in 1998, The Jacob Burns Film Center (JBFC) is a cultural arts center dedicated to presenting the best of independent, documentary, and world cinema; promoting 21st century literacy; and making film a vibrant part of the community. Since the JBFC opened its doors to the public in June 2001, more than a million people have seen over 3,000 films from every corner of the globe. Nearly 60,000 students in grades 3-12 and in college have participated in our education programs, more than 50% of them from underserved communities throughout the tri-state area. Our education programs are grounded in 21st century literacy skills, including critical viewing and production. These skills are essential for a generation growing up in a world in which media and technology is increasingly the way we participate in community, and engage in democracy and the global economy.
