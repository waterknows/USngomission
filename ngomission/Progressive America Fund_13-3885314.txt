Founded in 2006, the Center for Working Families (CWF) is a non-partisan think-and-do tank that brings innovative ideas into the public debate, providing policymakers with progressive policy solutions and helping build coalitions to win policy change. CWF is engaged with partner organizations and other allies to campaign for progressive tax policy, quality job creation, a green and equitable economy, and government reform. Our initiatives are designed to advance democracy and economic prosperity for middle- and low-income people.
