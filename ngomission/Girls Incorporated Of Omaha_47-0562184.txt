Girls Inc. of Omaha serves girls ages 5 through 18 years of age. Founded in 1975, today we have two centers in North Omaha and South Omaha, with art rooms, computer labs, a library, a woodshop, a sports field, and a playground. We serve hundreds of girls every day and 1,000+ girls each year. We've added pick up transportation, counseling services, healthy meals and snacks, and computer access to our daily services. Over the years, we have adapted our programs to meet the ever changing needs of our members, but it was and always will be all about the girls.
