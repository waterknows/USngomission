In response to growing awareness of the need for affordable and accessible family planning services, the first Planned Parenthood chapter in Tennessee was opened in the eastern region in 1961. PPMET is a recognized and respected leader in providing reproductive, sexual and complementary healthcare and comprehensive sexuality education to women, men and teens regardless of race, age, income status, religion or sexual orientation. We believe that the self-determined pursuit of sexual health is important for everyone's well-being and quality of life.
