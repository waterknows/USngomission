Christian Educational Ministries (CEM) was founded in November, 1995, as a service ministry with two major goals in mind. First in the hearts of all Christian people is the imperative to share the Gospel with the world, to evangelize, to make disciples for Jesus Christ. Second, it is our desire to teach those who are disciples of Jesus all that He commanded His disciples to do. To this end, we teach the Bible with a view to helping people make their own lives work while they are a positive influence and blessing to those around them. Our primary mission is carried out through the Born to Win Radio Program, literature, essays both in print and on the Internet, and published books. We also make available tape recorded sermons and an Adult Bible Studies Course in our CEM Bookstore.
