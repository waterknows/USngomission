The purpose of Resourcing Christian Education International (RCE) is to serve Christian education ministries in their mission of providing exceptional educational opportunities with a Biblical foundation and Christian worldview. As we partner with and assist educational institutions that range from traditional primary and secondary education schools to Christian colleges, seminaries and adult education centers, our goal is to serve them and their staff so that they can excel in the ministries to which God has called them!
