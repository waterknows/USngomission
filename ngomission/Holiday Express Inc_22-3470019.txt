The Holiday Express mission is to deliver music, food, gifts, financial support and friendship to those with the greatest need for the gift of human kindness during the holiday season and throughout the year. Founded in 1993, Holiday Express works year-round to deliver music, food, gifts, and human kindness to adults and children in need, including the mentally and physically disabled, the isolated, individuals in addiction and recovery programs, the poor and the homeless, and children with serious illnesses. With a constituency of more than 15,000 throughout the metropolitan tri-state area, our priority is to serve those who are desperately in need and often forgotten.
