Fairmount Park Conservancy exists to champion Philadelphia's parks. Our mission is to work as a collaborative partner to lead and support efforts that preserve and improve the parks and recreation system in order to enhance the quality of life and stimulate economic development of the Greater Philadelphia Region. We fulfill our mission by leading capital projects and historic preservation efforts, fostering neighborhood park stewardship, attracting and leveraging resources for the parks, and developing innovative programs throughout the 10,200 acres that include Fairmount Park and more than 100 neighborhood parks around the city. The Fairmount Park system is one of the largest urban park systems in the world and includes some of the region's most famous attractions.
