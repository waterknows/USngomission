The National Multiple Sclerosis Society's mission is to mobilize people and resources to drive research for a cure and to address the challenges of everyone affected by MS. The Wisconsin Chapter of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society is a community of individuals who are committed to achieving a world free of MS. The Chapter helps over 10,000 individuals throughout 68 counties throughout Wisconsin impacted by MS to move their lives forward. We provide comprehensive support services and educational programs to people with MS, their family and friends, and raise funds locally to support the National MS Society's research initiatives.
