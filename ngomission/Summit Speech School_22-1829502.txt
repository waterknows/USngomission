Summit Speech School, located in New Providence, New Jersey, was founded in 1967. The school is one of only 51 private oral/OPTION schools in the country and the first in New Jersey teaching children who are deaf and hard of hearing to listen and talk without the use of sign language. Using intensive speech, language and auditory training sessions, along with FM systems, their own hearing aids, and cochlear implants, the children learn to maximize their listening, language and speaking skills. Approximately 3,000 children from more than 230 communities throughout New Jersey have attended the school. It is the mission of Summit Speech School to enable children who are deaf or hard of hearing to take their place in a hearing world by providing superior educational and therapeutic support services through an auditory/oral program.
