The Boys & Girls Club of the Pikes Peak Region inspires and enables all young people, especially those who need us most, to reach their full potential as productive, caring, responsible citizens. We operate three after school youth development programs and six before & after school child care programs in the Pikes Peak Region, serving approximately 3,500 youth. Our purpose is to build self-esteem and life skills in children, ages 5-18, by providing hope and opportunity through quality programs and activities administered by trained professional staff in a positive, safe environment. We offer more than 30 national programs within the five core program areas: education and career development; character and leadership development; the arts; health and life skills; and sports, fitness and recreation.
