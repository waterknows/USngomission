America's pre-eminent film presentation organization, the Film Society of Lincoln Center was founded in 1969 to celebrate American and international cinema, to recognize and support new filmmakers, and to enhance awareness, accessibility and understanding of the art among a broad and diverse film going audience. The Film Society is best known for two world-class international festivalsâ€”the New York Film Festival (the most famous and prestigious in the country), and New Directors/New Films (celebrating new cinematic artists).
