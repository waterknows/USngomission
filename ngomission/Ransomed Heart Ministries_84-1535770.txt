At Ransomed Heart, our mission is simple, but powerful. We desire to recover the treasure of the Gospel, transform the lives of men and women, and teach men and women to walk with God while living it ourselves. We also desire to equip men to rescue others, provide ongoing nourishment, and show the way to new wineskins. Our hope is to change the face of Christianity.
