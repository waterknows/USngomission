The Immokalee Foundation is dedicated to building pathways to success for the children of Immokalee.



We empower Immokalee's children through programs focused on education, vocation, and life skills that lead to economic independence. The Immokalee Foundation offers students the tools, opportunities, and encouragement they need to succeed at each level of their education and in their careers.



Since being founded in 1991, The Immokalee Foundation has served over 1,000 students, achieved a 100% high school graduation rate for participants, as well as a 85% post-secondary graduation rate.
