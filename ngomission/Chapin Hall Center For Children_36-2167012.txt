With roots dating back to 1860, Chapin Hall is an independent policy research center whose mission is to build knowledge that improves policies and programs for children and youth, families, and their communities. The aim of Chapin Hall's multidisciplinary research is to learn more about the state of our young people and their families and the degree to which the policies and programs designed to support them are succeeding. While our research concerns the well-being of all children and youth, we particularly focus on what is happening to the most vulnerable so that policymakers and practitioners can create institutions and programs that will help them develop into healthy, educated, productive adults. Chapin Hall serves as a fulcrum for interchange among the communities of public policy and child-family research, both nationally and internationally.
