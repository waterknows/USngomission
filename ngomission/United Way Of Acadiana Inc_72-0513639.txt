United Way of Acadiana is creating lasting change by focusing on the building blocks of a good life: education, earnings, and essentials. We all win when a child succeeds in school, when families are financially stable and when neighbors meet their own basic needs. We will build a stronger Acadiana and advance the common good by mobilizing our communities to improve people's lives. United Way of Acadiana is independent, separately incorporated and governed by local volunteers.
