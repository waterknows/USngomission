The quality of emergency medical care in our community has been the mission of the Medic One Foundation since 1974. The Foundation: guarantees rigorous paramedic training and continuing medical education that is experience-centered and under the guidance of University of Washington physicians; insures the quality of pre-hospital emergency care through independent medical review-continuously evaluating Medic One services, monitoring treatments and outcomes and developing new approaches to improve survival; sponsors targeted research on methods to improve patient outcomes and prevent sudden cardiac death; and equips emergency medical service providers by funding special equipment needs to help them in better serving their communities.
