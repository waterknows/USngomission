The Old Newsboys' Goodfellow Fund of Detroit is a 102-year-old charity founded in 1914 by James J. Brady. The organization includes 300 members whose sole mission is to ensure that there is "No Kiddie without a Christmas." Each holiday season the Detroit Goodfellows distribute holiday gift boxes to children ages four through 13 living in Detroit, Highland Park, River Rouge, Harper Woods and Hamtramck. Each child receives warm clothing, toys, books, games and candy.
