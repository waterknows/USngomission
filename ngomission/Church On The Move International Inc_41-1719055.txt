Mark Anderson founded Church on the Move International, an evangelistic and church planting ministry. The following year, extensive evangelism, church planting, medical, and training ministries began in the sub continent of India. While pastoring a church he planted in Minnesota, Mark watched God bless the global ministries of Church on the Move grow around the world with over 600,000 people coming to Christ in just four years. Church on the Move International communicates the Gospel of Jesus Christ, with an emphasis on reaching youth, through area wide crusades and impact tours. We use music, testimony, preaching and special programs to present the Gospel.
