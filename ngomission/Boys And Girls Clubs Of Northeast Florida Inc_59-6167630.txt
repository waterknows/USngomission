Originally called the Boys Club of Jacksonville and chartered in 1962, the Boys & Girls Clubs of Northeast Florida began operating under its current name in 1988. The Boys & Girls Clubs of Northeast Florida works to inspire and enable all young people, especially those from disadvantaged circumstances, to realize their full potential as productive, responsible, and caring citizens. Based on the physical, emotional, cultural and social needs and interests of girls and boys attending the Clubs, we provide diversified, research-based program activities in five core areas. These core service areas serve as the vehicles through which we employ our nationally tested, time-proven youth development strategy.
