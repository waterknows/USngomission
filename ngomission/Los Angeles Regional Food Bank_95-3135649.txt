The Los Angeles Regional Food Bank has been serving the community since 1973. The Food Bank's mission is to mobilize resources to fight hunger in our community and our vision is that no one goes hungry in Los Angeles County. We are at the heart of a charitable food distribution network that includes 640 agencies with over 1,000 agency and program sites throughout Los Angeles County including abused and abandoned children homes, battered women shelters, senior centers, local food pantries, soup kitchens, AIDS hospices and more. In 2011, we distributed 60 million pounds of food including 14 million pounds of produce. We served 1 million men women and children.
