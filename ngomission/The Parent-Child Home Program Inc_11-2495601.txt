The Parent-Child Home Program's National Center strives to ensure that families in communities across the country have access to The Parent-Child Home Program. The National Center assists communities in developing Parent-Child Home Program replications and expanding existing sites. The Center works to increase public awareness about the importance of early parent-child verbal interaction and works with public officials to increase the availability of public funds that can be utilized to support Parent-Child Home Program replications around the country.
