The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation was created by Congress in 1984 to protect and restore our nation's fish, wildlife, and habitats by investing federal dollars in the most pressing conservation needs and matching those dollars with private funds. The Foundation has proudly awarded 10,800 grants to 3,700 organizations and leveraged $680 million into $1.6 billion for conservation on the ground.
