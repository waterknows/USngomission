Carolina for Kibera (CFK) exists to develop local leaders, catalyze positive change and alleviate poverty in the Kibera slum of Nairobi. Driven by local needs, our collaborative network of programs advance health, education, ethnic cooperation, gender equality and economic empowerment, and equip leaders with tools to strengthen the community. We envision a Kibera where people are healthy, safe, and self-sufficient - a place where every person, regardless of their background, has a voice in their future and access to opportunities and resources to realize that future. We envision a community that finds strength in diversity and individuals that are empowered to pursue opportunities both locally and across the globe.
