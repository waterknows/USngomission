Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) was established in Troy, New York, in 1824 as the Rensselaer School by Stephen Van Rensselaer "for the purpose of instructing persons ... in the application of science to the common purposes of life". Rensselaer is a diverse community of dreamers and doers who share several characteristics. They are drawn to the sciences and technology, and to disciplines ranging from architecture and business to literature. They love to tackle complex problems, and they have a sincere desire to improve the world. Yet the people of Rensselaer are true individuals: everyone who comes here seeks a pathway to greatness that is uniquely his or her own.
