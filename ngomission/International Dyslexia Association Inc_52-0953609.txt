Founded in 1949, The International Dyslexia Association (IDA) is a scientific and educational organization dedicated to the study and treatment of the learning disability dyslexia as well as related language-based learning differences. We are the oldest such organization in the U.S. that serves individuals with dyslexia, their families, and professionals in the field. IDA focuses its resources in four major areas: information and referral services, research, professional development, advocacy and public policy. We publish a peer-reviewed journal, Annals of Dyslexia, as well as a quarterly publication, Perspectives on Language and Literacy. In addition, we fund research on neurological, educational and developmental issues as they relate to dyslexia. We advocate for the rights of individuals with dyslexia both through the legal and Federal legislative systems.
