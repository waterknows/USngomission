Since that time, the Northern Indiana chapter has grown into the largest of almost 200 ministry centers throughout the United States. YFC reaches young people everywhere, working together with the local church and other likeminded partners to raise up lifelong followers of Jesus who lead by their godliness in lifestyle, devotion to the Word of God and prayer, passion for sharing the love of Christ and commitment to social involvement.
