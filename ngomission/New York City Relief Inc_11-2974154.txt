The Relief Bus outreach consists of two former school buses now customized into mobile resource centers to help the poor and homeless. Friendly faces serve up a delicious, hearty vegetable soup that truly tantalizes the taste buds, fresh Portuguese rolls and hot chocolate or iced tea (depending on the season) complete the menu. We connect people to shelter, job training, medical care, detox and faith-based drug/alcohol rehabilitation centers. This kind of helping hand can literally transform someone's future and can many times make the difference between life and death.
