Friends of UNFPA was established in 1998. It is a non-profit organization, headquartered in New York, that supports the work of UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund. UNFPA is delivering a world where every pregnancy is wanted, every birth is safe, and every young person's potential is fulfilled. Friends of UNFPA advances this global effort by mobilizing funds and action for UNFPA's lifesaving work.
