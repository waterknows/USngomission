The Seattle Public Library Foundation was established in 1980 by a group of far-sighted citizens who understood that a great Library wouldn't be possible through public funding alone. The Foundation has continued its original vision of generating private-sector support to supplement tax-based funding. The result has been improved collections, expanded programs, and enhanced services. The Foundation's fund-raising efforts focus on three key areas: collections, programs, and facilities. With funding from The Seattle Public Library Foundation, the Library can offer a wide range of innovative programs and resources.
