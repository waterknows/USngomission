Since 1986, Project Self-Sufficiency (PS-S) has been creating opportunity for low-income, single parent families in Larimer County who are struggling to make ends meet and overcome the cycle poverty. From educational development and career planning to adequate child care access and housing, the program is a comprehensive resource providing everything a single parent needs to become self-sufficient: career planning, education and training, remove barriers, promote family health, encourage self advocacy, and prevent poverty. PS-S evolved from the efforts of a countywide task force that met in 1985 to better coordinate and expand services for low-income, single parents and their children while encouraging the families toward greater self-sufficiency. Task force members pledged resources, including staff time and housing assistance for families, and the new project began in October 1986 with the enrollment of 65 families. Current program capacity is 150 families.
