Fieldstone Farm is recognized as one of the largest therapeutic riding centers in North America. Founded in 1978 with the goal of helping improve the lives of those with special needs, the organization is breaking new ground in the field of equine therapy and changing many lives in the community. Each year, as a result of the dedication of more than 600 volunteers and 35 horses, Fieldstone helps nearly 800 students achieve what they often thought was impossible. Students range from age two to seniors and have a wide range of disabilities from cognitive impairments such as Down Syndrome or Autism Spectrum Disorder to physical disabilities such as Cerebral Palsy and spinal cord injuries as well as mental health issues and sensory impairments. All are learning riding skills while they improve their balance, strengthen muscles, work on educational goals, advance communication skills, increase their self-esteem and gain confidence.
