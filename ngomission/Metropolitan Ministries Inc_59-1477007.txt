For over 40 years, Metropolitan Ministries has served poor and homeless men, women, and children in the Tampa Bay region. The Ministries has gone from a single room food pantry, to one of America's most effective and innovative caregivers. With onsite transitional housing for 100 families and serving as many as 150 families daily through Homeless Prevention and Housing Programs, the Ministries remains committed to breaking the cycle of poverty. Metropolitan Ministries' mission is to care for the homeless and those at risk of becoming homeless in our community through services that alleviate suffering, promote dignity and instill self-sufficiency...as an expression of the ongoing ministry of Jesus Christ.
