Founded in 1994, the International Children's Heart Foundation (ICHF) works to bring the skills, technology and knowledge to cure and care for children with congenital heart disease to developing countries. ICHF does this regardless of country of origin, race, religion or gender. We work toward our goal through our mission trips where we operate and educate local health care professionals, and provide needed equipment and medications. We strive to build sustainable and independent programs, making the need for ICHF obsolete. Since our inception, we have performed over 7,500 operations in countries that span all continents.
