The Public Art Fund (PAF) is New York's leading presenter of artists' projects, new commissions, and exhibitions in public spaces. Since its founding in 1977, PAF has been committed to working with emerging and established artists to produce innovative exhibitions of contemporary art for neighborhoods throughout New York City. By bringing artworks outside the traditional context of museums and galleries, the Public Art Fund provides a unique platform for an unparalleled public encounter with the art of our time. Since its founding PAF has presented more than five hundred artists' projects throughout New York, making it possible for artists to engage diverse audiences and, along the way, redefine what public art is in relation to the changing nature of contemporary art.
