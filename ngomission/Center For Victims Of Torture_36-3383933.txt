Founded in 1985, the Center for Victims of Torture (CVT) heals the wounds of torture on individuals, their families, and their communities and to stop torture worldwide. We work locally, nationally, and internationally to build healing communities where torture survivors feel welcomed, protected and healed. CVT fulfills this mission by providing services directly to torture survivors; training and providing capacity building support to professionals and organizations who work with torture survivors and refugees; conducting research on the effects of torture and on effective treatment methods to be sure that we are providing the best care we can to our clients; and advocating for public policy initiatives that will help heal survivors and put an end to the practice of torture.
