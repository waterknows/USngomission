Since 1944, Youth for Christ (YFC) has had a distinctive history of youth evangelism. Beginning in dozens of cities at the end of World War II, YFC quickly organized into a national movement. Starting with Saturday night youth rallies in the late 1940s and early 1950s, YFC's ministry methodology turned to Bible Clubs in the late 50s and 60s. It was in this period of ministry that the concept of teen to teen evangelism was birthed. The vision of YFC is, as a part of the body of Christ, to see every young person in every people group in every nation have the opportunity to make an informed decision to become a follower of Jesus Christ and to become a part of a local church.
