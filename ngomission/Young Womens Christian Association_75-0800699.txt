The YWCA of Metropolitan Dallas was founded to help improve women's lives and remove barriers to self-sufficiency. We aim to lift women out of poverty, illiteracy and second-class citizenship so the whole community benefits. For 100 years, the YWCA has played a vital role in the community, continuously adapting to meet women's most critical needs. Today's YWCA focuses primarily on helping women move from poverty to self-sufficiency. The YWCA's average client is a single mother of two children with an annual income of only $26,000. Many live just above the poverty threshold, making them ineligible for public benefits but still in need of assistance to achieve self-sufficiency.
