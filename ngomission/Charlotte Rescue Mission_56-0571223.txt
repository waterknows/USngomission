Founded in 1938, Charlotte Rescue Mission has a long history of reaching out to the homeless and to those battling addictions. Today, the mission provides a free 90-120 day residential program to men at the Rebound Campus and to women at the Dove's Nest campus. Charlotte Rescue Mission is transforming lives in the name of Christ by serving people struggling with addiction, poverty, or hopelessness with the goal of returning them to society as productive, self-sufficient citizens.
