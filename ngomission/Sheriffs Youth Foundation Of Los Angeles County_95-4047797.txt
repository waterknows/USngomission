Sheriff's Youth Foundation of Los Angeles County is dedicated to providing Los Angeles County youth with safe facilities, planned programs, and the vital tools they need to thrive and succeed in life. The programs of the Sheriff's Youth Foundation enable us to bring resources to action in the interests of our communities' youths. Our six programs each fill a particular role as they work together to help achieve the Foundation's mission of steering youths toward lives of responsible adulthood.
