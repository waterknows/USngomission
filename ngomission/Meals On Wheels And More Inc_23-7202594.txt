Meals on Wheels and More (MOWAM ) seeks to nourish and enrich the lives of the homebound and other people in need through programs that promote dignity and independent living. MOWAM began in 1972 as an East Austin-based, grassroots organization staffed by only eight volunteers. What began serving 29 seniors has now expanded into a multi-service organization of 5,000 volunteers serving almost 2,500 elderly and disabled persons each day. Aside from preparing an average of 936,009 meals in 2008 year, MOWAM also offers many other programs designed to keep people healthy and living in their own homes.
