The mission of The George Washington Foundation is to enhance the public understanding and appreciation of the lives, values, and legacies of George Washington, Fielding and Betty Washington Lewis, and their families. In 1922, an energetic and far-sighted group of people led by Mrs. Vivian Minor Fleming, rallied the resources to purchase Kenmore, the Fredericksburg house completed in 1775 by George Washington's sister Betty and her husband, Colonel Fielding Lewis. Launching the campaign to save Kenmore, then Vice President Calvin Coolidge said, "It ought to be preserved for its own sake. It must be preserved for patriotic America."
