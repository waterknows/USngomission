United Way of Marion County unites local resources to help our neighbors. United Way of Marion County is working to advance the common good by focusing on the building blocks of life--Education, Income and Health. More than just a fundraiser, United Way of Marion County also engages our neighbors and focuses resources to provide solutions for important human needs in the community. Together, united, we make a bigger difference than we would separately. Our goal is to create long-lasting and measurable changes that improve the quality of life for struggling individuals, families and children throughout Marion County.
