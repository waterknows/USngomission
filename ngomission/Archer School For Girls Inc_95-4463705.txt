Founded in 1995, The Archer School for Girls is an educational community that supports and challenges young women to discover their passions and realize their true potential. We help girls become leaders and life-long learners. Our rigorous, integrated college preparatory curriculum fosters critical thinking and intellectual curiosity in a collaborative teaching and learning environment. Students are encouraged to develop meaningful relationships with peers and faculty rooted in honesty, respect and responsibility. Upon graduation, students leave as courageous, committed and ethical young women. The school's enrollment is 450. Of the 72 faculty members, 63% have advanced degrees; the student-teacher ratio is 7:1 and the average class size is 16.
