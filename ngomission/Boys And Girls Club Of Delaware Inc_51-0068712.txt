The Boys & Girls Clubs of Delaware is part of a nationwide movement whose mission is to inspire and enable all young people, especially those who need us most, to realize their full potential as productive, responsible, and caring citizens. We are the only statewide Boys & Girls Club in the world. We currently serve more than 35,000 young people ages 5-18 - one out of every five school-aged children in Delaware - at 44 locations across the state. Through innovative and proven educational enhancement, physical education, and character building programs, the Boys & Girls Clubs of Delaware helps young people realize their full potential as productive, responsible, and caring citizens.
