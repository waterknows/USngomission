Covenant House Texas is part of an international network founded in New York. Covenant House Texas opened its doors in Houston in 1983. We help kids in crisis through residential programs, community services and outreach efforts designed to keep young people off the streets. Each night, Covenant House Texas provides shelter to an average of 100 residential clients under the age of 21. We work with dozens more who come in for walk-in services, meet with our HIV case manager or visit counselors through our aftercare program. In addition, we serve hundreds of homeless kids and at-risk youths through our outreach and prevention efforts.
