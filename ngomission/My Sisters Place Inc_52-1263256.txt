Founded in 1979, My Sister's Place (MSP) is an interactive community committed to eradicating domestic violence. We provide safe, confidential shelter, programs, education and advocacy for battered women and their children. Our goal is to empower women to take control of their own lives. From the moment a woman and her children arrive at our emergency shelter, compassionate and professional staff supply victims of domestic violence with the tools necessary to attain self-sufficiency. Among the highest priorities beyond safety for each shelter resident are: securing transitional or permanent housing before the end of their stay in our emergency shelter; enrolling in higher education or job training or securing stable employment; developing a personalized safety plan; and receiving counseling to enhance coping skills.
