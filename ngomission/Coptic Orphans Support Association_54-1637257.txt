Coptic Orphans (CO) is an international Christian development organization that works with vulnerable children in Egypt to transform their local communities by breaking the cycle of poverty and injustice through literacy, education, advocacy, mentoring, and basic needs. Since the founding of the organization in 1988, CO has touched the lives of over 14,000 children in Egypt. We equip children who have lost a father with resources to access their basic rights through a church-based network in the Not Alone program; build self-esteem in girls at risk of dropping out of school through The Valuable Girl Project; connect youth from around the globe to Egypt in Serve to Learn; and support the education, health, and practical training of disabled, orphaned, and other disadvantaged children through our Grassroots Partner Initiatives.
