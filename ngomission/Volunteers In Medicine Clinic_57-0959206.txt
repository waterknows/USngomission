Volunteers in Medicine (VIM) began in Hilton Head, South Carolina. In 1992, one out of three people who lived on Hilton Head Island had no access to health care. At the same time, a number of retired medical personnel (physicians, nurses, dentists) began expressing an interest in finding a way to continue practicing their profession on a voluntary, part-time basis to help those without access to care. In 1993, Volunteers in Medicine Clinic was created as a free health clinic utilizing retired health care professionals. Now every person who lives or works on Hilton Head Island has easy access to health care.
