Formed in 1963, Sedgwick County Zoological Society works to foster public interest and support for the Sedgwick County Zoo, by operating and maintaining the Zoo. The Zoo has seen steady progress through the past three decades with major exhibits opening every few years. The Zoological Society also promotes education and research to better aid in the management and preservation of both zoo and wild animals. The Zoo has an annual attendance of nearly 550,000 visitors and is the number one tourist attraction in Kansas.
