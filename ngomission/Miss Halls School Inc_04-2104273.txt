Established in 1898, Miss Hall's School combines a traditional college-preparatory curriculum with two innovative, nationally acclaimed programs: Horizons, a weekly off-campus, experiential learning opportunity, and the Girls' Leadership Project, which transforms the School into a leadership laboratory. Approximately 206 boarding and day students in grades nine through twelve come from 19 states and 22 countries. The student body is diverse with 25 percent of the students being of color and 33 percent being international. Approximately 50 percent of the students receive some level of financial assistance to attend the School. Miss Hall's School inspires and encourages each girl to pursue the highest standards of learning and character; to contribute boldly and creatively to the common good; and to seek a purposeful life based on honor, respect, and personal authenticity.
