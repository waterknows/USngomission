The Rescue Mission was founded in 1912 to address the physical and spiritual needs of transient men drawn to Tacoma by the lumber and maritime industries. The Rescue Mission now serves homeless women and homeless families with children, as well as homeless men. In addition to providing emergency shelter and meals, the Rescue Mission addresses some of the issues that cause homelessness. Programming helps people who are homeless to transform their lives, leaving homelessness for self-sufficient and productive lives in the community.
