Founded in 1987, Habitat for Humanity Greater Boston is dedicated to building simple low-cost homes by forming partnerships with low-income families in need of decent and affordable housing. We believe homeownership is a vital step to help families break the cycle of poverty and contributes to pride in families and communities. Habitat for Humanity Greater Boston is an independent affiliate of Habitat for Humanity International, an ecumenical Christian organization headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia and dedicated to ending poverty housing throughout the world as a matter of justice, mercy, compassion and humility.
