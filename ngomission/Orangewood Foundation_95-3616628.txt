Orangewood Children's Foundation began over 30 years ago with a vision to build a facility to shelter Orange County children who were the victims of abuse, neglect and abandonment. Today our focus is on the ongoing needs of children in the foster care system, developing a wide range of activities, scholarships, support and programs to give every child every chance to succeed.
