Goodwill provides education, career development and employment opportunities to help Coloradans in need achieve self-sufficiency, dignity, and hope through the Power of Work. 

Our job will be done when every person in our community lives to his or her true potential and achieves self-sufficiency. We translate the good in the local community to programs and resources that change lives. This is accomplished through four program areas: job training programs within community high schools; job skills training and placement for adults; vocational training for individuals with disabilities at Goodwill's corporate office; and retail employment and recycling programs.
