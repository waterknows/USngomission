Founded in 1983, the Partnership for the Homeless is committed to building a just and equitable society and creating lasting community change through solution-oriented programs and policy initiatives that eliminate the root causes of homelessness. The Partnership developed the Home in the Community model - a groundbreaking programmatic approach that guides all of our work. Most important, our model gives primacy to our clients' right to determine the type of housing, neighborhood, and services that are best aligned with their needs and life choices. Our experience shows that this client-centric approach is very successful - our clients stay housed and find social and economic stability in their new communities.
