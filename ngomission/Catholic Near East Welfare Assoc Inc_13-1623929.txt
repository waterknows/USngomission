Catholic Near East Welfare Association was founded by the Holy Father to share the love of Christ with the churches and peoples of the East. We work for, through and with the Eastern Catholic Churches to identify needs and implement solutions. Together, we build up the Church, affirm human dignity, alleviate poverty, encourage dialogue--and inspire hope.
