Founded in 1980 the Center for Asian American Media (CAAM), formerly known the National Asian American Telecommunications Association, has grown into the largest organization dedicated to the advancement of Asian Americans in independent media, specifically the areas of television and filmmaking. Dedicated to presenting stories that convey the richness and diversity of Asian American experiences to the broadest audience possible, CAAM funds, produces, distributes and exhibits works in film, television and digital media. Apart from their public television work, CAAM's most visible community contribution is their yearly San Francisco International Asian American Film Festival (SFIAAFF).
