The International Game Fish Association's (IGFA) objectives are founded on the beliefs that game fish species, related food fish, and their habitats are economic, social, recreational, and aesthetic assets which must be maintained, wisely used and perpetuated; and that the sport of angling is an important recreational, economic, and social activity which the public must be educated to pursue in a manner consistent with sound sporting and conservation practices. IGFA maintains and publishes world records for saltwater, freshwater, fly fishing catches, U.S. state freshwater records, and junior angler records. The IGFA Fishing Hall of Fame & Museum provides the world's most comprehensive assemblage of sport fishing information, exhibits, educational classes, and more.
