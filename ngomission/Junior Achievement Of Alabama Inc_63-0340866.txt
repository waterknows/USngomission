Junior Achievement of Alabama is the largest and most comprehensive volunteer-delivered economics education program in the state of Alabama. Our volunteer-led programs teach K-12 students about business and entrepreneurship, financial literacy, and workforce readiness. Volunteers share their personal and business experience to bring JA curriculum to life, helping students understand the real-world application of what they are learning in school. This added relevancy makes economic concepts relevant, fuel the entrepreneurial spirit, and prepares young people to succeed in a global economy.
