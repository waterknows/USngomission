Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania believes that every child should be a wanted child. Then women and men can achieve the self-determination that makes families and societies strong. It is therefore PPSP's mission to protect and enhance reproductive freedom, to increase access to reproductive health services and information, and to promote sexual health. PPSP is composed of a diverse team of pro-choice women and men who, on a daily basis, provide high-quality sexual health care, offer expert sexuality education, and promote effective advocacy to protect our right to reproductive choice. We offer personal, affordable medical services and education programs, and help to shape public policy at the local, state and federal levels.
