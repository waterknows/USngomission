Panama City Rescue Mission is a privately funded organization. We provide an environment where the compassion and love of Jesus Christ can empower people to overcome and prevent life's adversities. We receive no direct city, county, state or federal funding and is not currently an affiliated agency of the United Way (however, United Way contributors can designate their donations to the Mission). All funding comes from grants, foundations, businesses, churches, and members of the community, plus proceeds from The Bargain Center and other work training/enterprise programs.
