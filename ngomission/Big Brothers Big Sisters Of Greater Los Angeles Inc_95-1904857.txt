Founded in 2001, every year, BBBSLA impacts more 1,500 youth through five unique mentoring programs that serve children and youth in their communities, schools, and in the workplace. By building a strong, one-to-one and professionally-supported mentoring relationship to serve as a foundation for transformative impact and life skills learning, BBBSLA's innovative approaches to expanding mentoring opportunities help to close both the achievement and opportunity gaps that exist for too many underserved children and youth.
