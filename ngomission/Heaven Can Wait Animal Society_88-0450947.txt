Heaven Can Wait Animal Society, an animal humane organization, was formed in 2000 by a group of five concerned citizens with the idea of building a beautiful 20 acre sanctuary to house all of the unwanted animals in our community. In the meantime, though, animals were and still are dying at rate of around 30,000 per year in our local shelters with even more just dying in the streets. Therefore, we decided to refocus our efforts slightly away from rescue and more toward promoting spay/neuter as the solution to the tragic pet overpopulation problem here in Las Vegas. On June 19, 2009 Heaven Can Wait took a giant leap forward by opening a high-volume/high-quality, low-cost/no-cost spay/neuter clinic near Eastern & 95. This clinic will serve as a much-needed resource for those who aren't able to afford sterilization services at regular veterinary prices. Amazingly, over the past 10 years we have spay/neutered close to 65,000 cats and dogs.
