In 2002, Jode Eye and Marie McClung created Clothes To Kids, Inc. (CTK) out of a passion for helping children in need. The mission of Clothes To Kids is to provide new and quality used clothing to low-income, school-age children in Pinellas County, free of charge. Clothes To Kids envisions a community in which every school-age child has quality clothing so that he or she may attend school with the confidence and self-esteem needed to achieve academic success. Since opening its doors in 2003, CTK has distributed more than 75,000 wardrobes to local school children. In Pinellas County, CTK is recognized as a "first responder" when there is a need for children's clothing, and currently accepts referrals from 107 social service agencies, 44 faith communities, 17 city and county agencies, and 150 schools.  CTK operates two stores - one in North County (Clearwater) and one in South County (St. Petersburg).
