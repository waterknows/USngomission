The mission of Green Corps is to train organizers, provide field support for today's critical environmental campaigns, and graduate activists who possess the skills, temperament, and commitment to fight and win tomorrow's environmental battles. In 1992, U.S. PIRG (Public Interest Research Group), the Federation of State PIRGs, launched Green Corps as a graduate school for environmental organizers - with a difference. This program not only gives participants a solid academic grounding in their field of choice; it provides concrete field experience, establishes relationships between the participants and the major environmental organizations they hope to serve in, and even pays participants to enable them to engage full-time in their chosen work.
