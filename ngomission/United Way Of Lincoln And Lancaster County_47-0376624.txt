United Way of Lincoln and Lancaster County works to bring the whole community together to create long-term, lasting change. While most charities focus on a single group or issue, United Way tackles issues facing Lincoln and Lancaster County as a whole. Together with more than 500 volunteers, we identify and prioritize community goals-- whether those goals include shelter for displaced families or health and nutrition assistance for seniors-- and bring together the right people, ideas, and resources to achieve them.
