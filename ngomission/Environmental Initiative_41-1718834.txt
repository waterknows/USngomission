Environmental Initiative is a nonprofit organization that builds partnerships to develop collaborative solutions to Minnesota's environmental problems. We plan and host events for environmental leaders to share information, network and learn from one another, as well as facilitating environmental policy conversations. We take action and implement on the ground environmental projects to improve our air, land, and water. As a catalyst, convener, or implementer, Environmental Initiative develops creative solutions to environmental problems with our partners.
