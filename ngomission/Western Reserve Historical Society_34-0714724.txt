The Western Reserve Historical Society (WRHS) was founded in 1867 to preserve and present the history of all of the people of Northeast Ohio. Today, it is the largest privately supported regional historical society in the nation. WRHS exists to collect, preserve and present Northeast Ohio history and make this history accessible to audiences of all ages through exhibitions and programs that explore the heritage of this region. The Society's main campus in University Circle houses the History Museum, the Archives/Library, the Crawford Auto-Aviation Museum and Chisholm Halle Costume Wing.
