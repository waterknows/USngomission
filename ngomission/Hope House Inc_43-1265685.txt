Hope House's works to break the cycle of domestic violence by providing safe refuge and supportive services that educate and empower women and children. Hope House will advocate social change that protects and engenders a person's right to live a life free of abuse. Hope House services form a safety net of prevention, education and support for thousands of people traumatized by domestic violence every year. Residential services are provided through two secure locations in Independence and Lee's Summit, Missouri and comprehensive outreach services are provided to those not needing secure shelter.
