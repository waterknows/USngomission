Established in 1981, the Blue Ridge Area Food Bank's (BRAFB) mission is to feed hungry people through a network of community organizations, and to engage our communities in the fight to end hunger locally and nationally. We ensure that people are food secure by providing access to three nutritious meals a day for children and access to two nutritious meals a day for adults year round. BRAFB serves 25 counties and nine cities in northern, western, and central Virginia.
