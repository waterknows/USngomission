United Way of Northern Utah's mission is to improve lives in Northern Utah by mobilizing the caring power of our community. Everyone deserves opportunities to have a good life: a quality education that leads to a stable job, enough income to support a family through retirement, and good health. United Way's work is focused on the building blocks for a good life:

Education -- Helping children and youth achieve their potential

Income -- Promoting financial stability and independence

Health -- Improving people's health

Advancing the common good is less about helping one person at a time and more about changing systems to help all of us.
