Peace First teaches young people the critical skills of peacemaking - the social-emotional skills of cooperation, communication, conflict resolution, and empathy as well as the core tools for civic engagement - as a core part of their school day, alongside reading and math. The heart of our program is a Pre-K-8 curriculum integrated weekly into the academic frameworks of the school, taught by AmeriCorps members in partnership with the classroom teacher. The program begins by teaching basic communication and conflict resolution strategies through hand-on activities and then allowing students to put their peacemaking skills into action through a community service learning projects that promote civic engagement. This classroom work is supported by intense coaching with principals and lead teachers to deepen their efficacies in supporting academically and emotionally successful young people.
