The Israel Cancer Research Fund (ICRF) was founded in 1975 by a group of American and Canadian researchers, oncologists, and lay people determined to harness Israel's educational and scientific resources in the fight against cancer. Its initial purpose was to stem the brain drain of Israeli researchers by providing funds for postdoctoral fellowships for young Ph.D.'s. ICRF is the only U.S.-based charity solely devoted to supporting cancer research in Israel. Since its inception, ICRF has provided more than $52 million to support innovative studies by Israeli scientists. Our awardees are selected through a rigorous peer-review process that is conducted by a world-class scientific panel. We support individuals at all of the major research institutions in Israel.
