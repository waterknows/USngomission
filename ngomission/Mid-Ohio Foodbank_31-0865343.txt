Mid-Ohio Foodbank's mission is to end hunger one nourishing meal at a time and co-create a sustainable community where everyone thrives. For over 30 years, we've been working with grocers, food companies, Ohio farmers, the USDA, and community partners to obtain food and distribute it to our partner agencies. The partnerships we share with more than 650 partner agencies and community organizations across our 20-county service area is crucial to our mission. It's these food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters, after-school programs, and senior housing sites that ensure the food we deliver gets to the people who need it most. Together, we distribute enough food to provide 121,625 meals for food insecure Ohioans every day.
