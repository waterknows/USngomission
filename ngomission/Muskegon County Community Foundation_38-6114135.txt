The Community Foundation for Muskegon County was created in 1961 to improve the quality of life for Muskegon County residents. As a publicly supported community endowment, the Foundation receives and manages contributions from community citizens and organizations who are charitably inclined and committed to the future of Muskegon County. The Foundation presently supports efforts in the areas of arts, education, environment, community development, health and human services as well as youth development issues. It is the intent of the Foundation to reflect the collective vision of all Muskegon County residents.
