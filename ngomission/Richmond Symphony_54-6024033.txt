The Richmond Symphony performs, teaches and champions music, to enrich and entertain communities throughout Virginia.



Founded in 1957 to provide Central Virginia with a professional orchestra, the Richmond Symphony (RSO) is dedicated to achieving excellence in both contemporary and traditional symphonic repertoire. We incorporate classical, gospel, jazz, and contemporary and popular music into our repertoire, making good music interesting and accessible to everyone. The Symphony performed only three concerts in its inaugural season; today, the orchestra makes more than 200 public appearances each season. The Symphony's educational programs seek to foster and develop diverse, informed audiences; to help nurture and develop young musicians; and to advocate for music education and orchestral music. We serve more than 35,000 area school-aged children each year.
