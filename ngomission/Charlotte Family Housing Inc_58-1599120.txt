Charlotte Family Housing is a shelter-to-housing program for homeless families. We hold a deep belief in the strength and the capability of our families. We build upon our families' strengths to help them forge a path back to self-sufficiency. Our model is designed to produce healthy, deep, measurable and lasting change. While we primarily serve single mothers with children, we are also one of the limited options for single fathers with children and two-parent families. Our social workers are trained to partner in all aspects of a family's life to give direction on reaching their goals, especially with financial literacy, vocational counseling, children's education and health and wellness.
