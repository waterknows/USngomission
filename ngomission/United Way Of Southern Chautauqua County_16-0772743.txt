Founded in 1920, the United Way of Southern Chautauqua County builds a stronger community by meeting the most important human care needs of our children, families, adults, and neighborhoods. We involve, organize, and motivate individuals and community organizations to identify needs and create positive change. United Way and its partners develop the resources needed to support these efforts, and use them effectively to achieve measurable results. This year, United Way is supporting 46 programs through 20 local human service agencies that provide such diverse services as daycare scholarships for seniors, local disaster relief, safe haven for abused women, mentoring for teens, counseling for families, and positive youth development programs for boys and girls.
