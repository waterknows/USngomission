We are United to End Genocide, the largest activist organization in America dedicated to preventing and ending genocide and mass atrocities worldwide. United to End Genocide arose from the merger of the Save Darfur Coalition and the Genocide Intervention Network. Those organizations led the historic movement to demand an end to genocide in Darfur. We all have a role to play in the growing movement to end genocide, and so, United to End Genocide is set up in a way that makes it as easy as possible for you to join, participate, and take effective action in concert with hundreds of thousands of others who share our concerns and our sense of urgency. We're the place you can come for information and opportunities to take action that will make our elected leaders respond effectively.
