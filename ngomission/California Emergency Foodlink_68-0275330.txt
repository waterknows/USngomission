California Emergency Foodlink was founded in 1992 with the mission of finding sensible solutions to hunger that effectively address its root causes: poverty and joblessness. To accomplish its mission Foodlink has implemented a mission strategy of building better communities by providing jobs, preventing hunger and training for the future. At no charge to recipient agencies, Foodlink delivers more than 100 million pounds of food per year throughout California. Foodlink delivers government commodities from The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) as well as fresh produce collected under the statewide agricultural food rescue program, Donate-Don't Dump (DDD).
