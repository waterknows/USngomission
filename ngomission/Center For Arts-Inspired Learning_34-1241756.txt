The Center for Arts-Inspired Learning enriches the lives of children and promotes creative learning by uniting arts and education. In 60 years, the Center for Arts-Inspired Learning (formerly Young Audiences of Northeast Ohio) has served nearly 7 million students in 18 counties through arts education, and has reached even more through our advocacy efforts, professional development, and community programs. Arts education is what we do, and it's the one place where you can do it all, dance, theater, music, digital arts, visual arts, on-location performances, workshops, residencies, and professional development. Plus, our experienced Education Staff can help customize all of our arts-programming.
