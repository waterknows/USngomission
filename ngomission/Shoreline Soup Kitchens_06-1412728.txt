For 26 years, The Shoreline Soup Kitchens & Pantries (SSKP) has provided food and fellowship to residents in need along the Connecticut shoreline by providing hot meals and groceries. We serve the towns of Essex, Chester, Clinton, Madison, Old Saybrook, East Lyme, Lyme, Old Lyme, Killingworth, Westbrook & Deep River. In 2014, 8,300 people came to our soup kitchens and pantries, receiving enough food for almost 950,000 meals. Our pantries distributed 1,177,540 lbs of food in 2014. Home-style meals are served each day at one of our 8 meal sites. Groceries are available each week at one of our 5 food pantries. Frozen, microwaveable meals are prepared by our 2 Heat & Eat kitchens, and distributed at our pantries. When a guest attends our pantry, they receive enough food for three meals worth of food for three days for each member of their household. All of SSKP's sites are located in faith communities, and we employ only a small staff, operating with the assistance of over 900 volunteers.
