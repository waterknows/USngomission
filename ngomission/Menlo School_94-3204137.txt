Established in 1915, Menlo School offers a rigorous, engaging academic curriculum complemented by outstanding creative arts and athletics programs. We seek to attract and enroll motivated students who are secure in their academic skills and who will contribute to the rich fabric of our school community. Classes are small across grade levels, and students participate in hands-on, active learning. The Upper School enrolls 540 students in grades 9-12. There are 220 Middle School students in grades 6-8. Menlo School works to empower students to explore and expand their interests, reach their fullest potential, develop the skills necessary for success in college, and become ethical, responsible, and engaged members of ever wider communities.
