My Friend's Place assists and inspires homeless youth to build self-sufficient lives. In 1990, the doors of a facility called My Friend's Place were opened, providing sack lunches to the homeless youth of Hollywood, social services and creative opportunities. Today, My Friend's Place is the most frequently visited drop-in Resource Center for homeless youth in Southern California serving 1,000 youth ages 12 and over and their children, each year. In addition, we offer a free comprehensive continuum of care that combines emergency necessities with therapeutic, health and education services through three program areas: safe have program, transformative education program, and a health and wellbeing program.
