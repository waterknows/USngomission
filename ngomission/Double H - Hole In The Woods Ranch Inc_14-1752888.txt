The mission of the Double H Ranch is to provide specialized camping and year round support for children and their families dealing with life-threatening illnesses. Our purpose is to enrich their lives and provide camp experiences that are memorable, exciting, fun, empowering, physically safe and medically sound. All programs are free of charge and capture the magic of the Adirondacks.
