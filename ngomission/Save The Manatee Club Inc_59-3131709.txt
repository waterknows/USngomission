Save the Manatee Club (SMC) was established in 1981 by former Florida Governor and U.S. Senator Bob Graham and singer/songwriter Jimmy Buffett. SMC works to protect endangered manatees and their aquatic habitat for future generations. In order to recover the manatee population, or delist the species, our goals are: to protect ample healthy habitat to support a stable or growing manatee population; to reduce manatee harassment, injuries and deaths from human activity; to ensure that sufficient regulations have been adopted to accomplish these goals. In order to accomplish our objective and goals we concentrate our efforts on reducing the negative impacts to manatees and their aquatic habitat caused by human activity.
