Created in 1986, the Initiative Foundation exists for one purpose, to improve the quality of life in central Minnesota. At the core of our work is the belief that local people possess the talent, passion and ability to achieve a brighter future. Our programs and investments strive to give every person an opportunity to contribute to a shared vision and plan of action that strengthens community character and relationships. Our mission is to unlock the power of central Minnesota people to build and sustain healthy communities. The Initiative Foundation exclusively serves the 14 counties and 160 hometowns that comprise central Minnesota. Since 1986, we have invested more than $53.5 million in the region through targeted grants and business financing investments.
