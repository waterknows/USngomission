Founded in 1972, Camphill Village Kimberton Hills is part of the international Camphill movement that provides programs and services for children, youth and adults with developmental disabilities. Our mission is to encourage individuals, especially those with special needs, to discover and develop their potential in a physically, socially and spiritually therapeutic environment. We value each person, regardless of ability, for his or her unique contribution to the village. Community members, with and without disabilities, live and work together as expanded families in comfortable homes throughout the village, forming a supportive community based on shared responsibility and caring. Located on 432 acres of farm, gardens and woodlands in Chester County, Pennsylvania, Camphill Village Kimberton Hills is also a local center for culture and a model for sound ecological living.
