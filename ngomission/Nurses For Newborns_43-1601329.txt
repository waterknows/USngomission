Nurses for Newborns Foundation (NFNF) exists to provide a safety net for families most at-risk through home visiting by experienced, registered nurses who provide healthcare and resources and teach positive parenting skills. The overall goal is to prevent child abuse and neglect and infant mortality. NFNF provides services to babies who are born with medical problems, born to teen moms or born to mothers with disabilities/mental health concerns, or who are born into families who do not have money for even basic necessities. In addition to medical care, we assist families whenever possible with donated materials needed for safe care, such as diapers, formula, baby food, clothing, bedding, and cribs. We welcome hundreds of volunteers each year who help us manage the logistics of this work.
