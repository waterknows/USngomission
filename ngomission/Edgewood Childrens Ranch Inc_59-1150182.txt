Founded in 1966, Edgewood Children's Ranch is a Christian-oriented, non-denominational, residential agency, serving children and families of Central Florida. Edgewood's mission is to rehabilitate youth-at-risk and their families, returning children to their homes and society as healthy, functioning young people and getting them back to the appropriate academic level in school. This mission is accomplished through three major areas of endeavor: Cottage Life, Education and Counseling. Through its residential coeducational program for boys and girls, ages 6-17, the Ranch today is able to accommodate more than 70 children at a time.
