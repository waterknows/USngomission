The United Way of Ulster County plays a unique role in our community by targeting funds to high quality, local programs and services that meet identified community needs. The motivation behind our work is the belief that it is the right of every individual to ask for help, and to have it granted by compassionate, knowledgeable people. Help finding a job, help learning to parent, help paying the rent, help overcoming substance abuse, help leaving an abusive relationship, help with childcare, help succeeding in school. We believe these services, and scores of others, should be available to anyone who needs and desires them.
