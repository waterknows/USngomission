Founded in 1984, Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden is located on 80 acres in Richmond, Virginia. A public place for the display and scientific study of plants, Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden is one of the only two independent public botanical gardens in Virginia and has the designation of a state botanical garden. The Garden provides education to the community about the plant world, promotes the best in horticulture and landscape design, and works toward the goal of being a leader in botanical and applied horticultural research. The Garden is providing technical guidance and counsel to a growing number of urban community gardens, neighborhood associations, and civic-minded institutions that are committed to improving the quality of life in our region through greening initiatives.
