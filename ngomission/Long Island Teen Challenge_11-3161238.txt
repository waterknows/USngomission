Long Island Teen Challenge has demonstrated a commitment to the communities of Long Island and New York City by combating the drug and alcohol epidemic in a threefold dynamic: prevention services through Rock the Block Urban Outreach, Hoop Challenge Basketball Camps, Street Rallies, School Assemblies and Super Saturday Kids Outreach; intervention services through concerned counseling, community care, support group services, coffee house outreach and crisis intervention; and residential services by housing up to 80 men and 20 women for 12 to 18 months of intensive, residential, faith-based restoration.
