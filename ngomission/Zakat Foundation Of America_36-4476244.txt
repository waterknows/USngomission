Founded in 2001, the Zakat Foundation of America aims to foster charitable giving and help generous and caring people reach out to those in need with direct aid. We strive to bridge the gap between our financially privileged donors and our beneficiaries in financial need, as we believe that the first group has responsibilities towards the second. Zakat Foundation is dedicated to alleviating the immediate needs of the poorest communities by providing food, shelter, health care and by delivering relief in emergencies. Zakat Foundation also provides education and training in order to equip people with the skills to help themselves.
