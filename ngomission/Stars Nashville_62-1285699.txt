Founded in 1984, STARS (Students Taking A Right Stand) is the leader in school-based Student Assistance Program services in Middle Tennessee. At STARS, we help schools tackle tough issues that threaten the emotional, psychological and academic well-being of area students issues such as substance abuse, violence, bullying, harassment, family conflicts and divorce, grief and loss, and myriad of other concerns. Through assemblies, classroom presentations, and group or individual counseling sessions, STARS assists schools in preventing and confronting these difficult challenges.
