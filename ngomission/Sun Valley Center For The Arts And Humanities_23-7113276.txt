Founded in 1971, the Sun Valley Center for the Arts' mission is to provoke and stimulate the imagination while opening hearts and minds through excellence in diverse arts programming. Our Core Purpose is to Engage through Art and Ideas. We fulfill our purpose by offering high quality programming in a variety of disciplines. Often theatre, music, the visual arts and humanities come together to explore an idea or theme that is relevant to our time. This unique, multidisciplinary approach to arts education allows us to present some of the world's most interesting artists, musicians, authors, filmmakers, authors and playwrights. With equal emphasis on the visual arts, the performing arts and the humanities, the Center has made a commitment to exploring issues from the perspectives of each of these three disciplines.
