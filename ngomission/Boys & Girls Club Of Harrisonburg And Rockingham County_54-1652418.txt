Our mission is to inspire and enable all young people, especially those who need us most, to realize their full potential as productive, responsible and caring citizens. The purpose of the Boys & Girls of Harrisonburg and Rockingham County is to promote the social, educational, health, leadership, and character development of boys and girls during critical periods of their growth.
