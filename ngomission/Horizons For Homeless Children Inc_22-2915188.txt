Horizons for Homeless Children was founded in 1988 as an independent organization dedicated exclusively to serving young homeless children and their families. Horizons for Homeless Children touches the lives of more than 2,200 young homeless children each week in Massachusetts through Playspaces (educational and recreational spaces) in shelters and 175 children through its three Community Children's Centers, Boston's only comprehensive, full-time early education and childcare centers specifically for homeless children. In addition to direct service, we advocate on behalf of young homeless children and their families with policy makers and provide training and technical assistance to related service providers.
