Since 1947 Cherry Street Mission Ministries (CSMM) has served homeless and low-income individuals. The doors are open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year to provide food, clothing, shelter, and other vital services including, literacy and vocational training, resource networking and job readiness assistance. Our mission is to serve all who come to us in need, and to provide purposeful discipleship by rescuing the downtrodden, restoring hope to the hopeless and releasing God's greatness to those we serve.
