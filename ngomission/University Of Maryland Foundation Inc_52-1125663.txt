Founded in 1979, the University System of Maryland Foundation (USM Foundation) supports the mission and ambitions of University System of Maryland (USM) member institutions and several community college clients throughout Maryland. The USM Foundation strengthens the USM's capacity to broaden access to high-quality higher education, meet the workforce needs of the state and the nation, and conduct research that expands the boundaries of knowledge. It does so through advocacy, fundraising, investment management, and stewardship.
