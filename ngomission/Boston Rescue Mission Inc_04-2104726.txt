Founded in 1899, the Boston Rescue Mission offers resources that prevent and end homelessness. We support the recovery, health, faith and independence of those who have a history of substance abuse, incarceration, and homelessness. We raise awareness about the root causes of these life risks, and serve everyone with respect, integrity and grace. We aim to reflect the teachings of Jesus and the love of God in all we do. At the Boston Rescue Mission, our programs and services focus a great deal on preventing homelessness. Our range of services also strives to meet the needs of a population of female ex-offenders. The goal of this re-entry program is to reduce recidivism, increase public safety, and help female ex-offenders to re-enter society as independent women living fulfilling and crime-free lives.
