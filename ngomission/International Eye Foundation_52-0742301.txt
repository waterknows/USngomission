Founded in 1961, the mission of International Eye Foundation (IEF) has been to prevent blindness and restore vision in the developing world. IEF's programs focuses on four key areas: confronting the leading causes of blindness in the developing world - cataract, trachoma, onchocerciasis, and vitamin A deficiency; reducing the cost barriers associated with purchasing necessary ophthalmic equipment and supplies; providing additional technical training for local nurses and ophthalmologists in developing nations; and improving management structures and financial stability of local eye clinics and hospitals.
