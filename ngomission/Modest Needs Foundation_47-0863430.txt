Modest Needs works to stop the cycle of poverty before it starts for the low-income workers whom conventional philanthropy has forgotten. We do this by empowering compassionate members of the general public to safely and securely help hard-working, low-income households to afford the kinds of short-term emergency expenses. Since 2002, by working together in this very 'modest' way, Modest Needs' donors have stopped 7,659 low-income individuals and families from entering the vicious cycle of poverty and a lifetime of dependence on the public welfare system for their survival. Together, we can make sure that no hard-working person is ever forced to choose between taking a child to the doctor and putting food on the table.
