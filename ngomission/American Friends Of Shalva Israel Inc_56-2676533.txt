American Friends of Shalva provides financial support for Shalva Israel. Founded in 1990, Shalva provides a therapeutic and supportive environment that advances the special needs child and enables the family to raise that child while living a normal and healthy lifestyle. Shalva provides services to more than 500 participants with special needs, including infants, children, adolescents and young adults via a plethora of tailored programs and round-the-clock therapies, seven days a week. Shalva accompanies the child and his/her family from birth to adulthood. Individual programs are so designed that each participant reaches his/her full potential. By placing an emphasis on social interaction, the special needs child can better integrate into the community.
