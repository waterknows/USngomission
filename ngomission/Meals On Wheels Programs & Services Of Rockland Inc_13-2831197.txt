The mission of Meals on Wheels Programs & Services of Rockland, Inc. is to serve the homebound, seniors and others in Rockland County through a multipurpose agency which focuses on nutritional, recreational and social support programs. Since being founded in 1974, Meals on Wheels has delivered more than seven million meals, often making the difference between a recipient being able to remain at home, living independently, or being placed in a health care or nursing home. Hundreds of dedicated volunteers support the agency's activities by delivering meals to individuals who are homebound, provide general assistance in the Senior Centers and Adult Daycare Centers and teach, coach and administer the Senior Net@Rockland program.
