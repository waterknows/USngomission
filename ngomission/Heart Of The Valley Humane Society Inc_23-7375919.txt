Heart of the Valley (HOV) is an animal shelter located in Bozeman with the mission to compassionately shelter the lost and surrendered pets of Gallatin and Madison valleys, and to enhance the lives of people and companion animals through pet adoption and education. HOV handles more than 2,500 cats and dogs every year. We have an open door policy and do not euthanize for space or length of time. Being an "open door" shelter means that HOV accepts any lost, abandoned or surrendered companion animals (cats or dogs) from anywhere. The animals arrive at HOV for all sorts of reasons and in every imaginable condition. No matter the circumstance or condition, HOV accepts them.
