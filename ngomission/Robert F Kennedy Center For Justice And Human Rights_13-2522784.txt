Founded in 1968, the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice & Human Rights pursues Robert Kennedy's vision of a more just and peaceful world by promoting the full spectrum of human rights. The RFK Center reaches around the world through programs that reflect Robert Kennedy's belief that to achieve social change, one must support, celebrate and give voice to the heroes of the human rights movement, while also combating the legal structures and institutions that gave rise to the injustices they face. All of the RFK Center's programs share one core belief-the positive actions of one individual can change the world. We advance the cause of human rights worldwide by supporting activists, authors, and journalists who defend human rights at great personal risk; by producing educational materials that inspire and teach students of all ages to live as defenders of human rights; and by convening and training the overseers of vast resources on the positive effects of socially responsible investing.
