Formed in 1974, COMPAS is Minnesota's most widely-used resource for artist residencies and community-building through the arts, engaging approximately 320,000 people in the arts in approximately 100 Minnesota towns each year. COMPAS began as Poets in the Schools in 1968, was incorporated as COMPAS in 1974, and merged with United Arts in 1998. With a mix of direct-service participatory programs and re-granting programs, COMPAS is similar to many of the local arts councils around the country. COMPAS reaches people of all ages; rural towns and city neighborhoods; students across the state; and artists. COMPAS offers the ArtsWork youth employment program, arts education, and grants to arts organizations, programs and events.
