With roots in the Lutheran Church, Wheat Ridge Ministries provides support for new church-related health and human care ministries, and we have been doing so for more than 100 years. Wheat Ridge Ministries is a primary leader, powerful catalyst and vital resource for efforts by the Lutheran community to stimulate the initial development of sustainable health and human care ministries, through which increasing numbers of people around the world experience wellness of body, mind and spirit made possible in Christ. Wheat Ridge Ministries has a special interest in nurturing new health and human care ministries developed by local congregations and new faith-based organizations. Wheat Ridge Ministries encourages the health and wellness of leaders and communities through its granting, connecting and equipping activities.
