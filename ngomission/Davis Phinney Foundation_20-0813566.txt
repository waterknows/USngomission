The Davis Phinney Foundation's provides essential information, practical tools, and inspiration to people living with Parkinson's and funds research closely aligned with our mission. While it's critical to find a cure for Parkinson's, we feel strongly that people living with this disease need information and tools to live well today. The Foundation was founded in 2004 by Olympic medal-winner and cycling great David Phinney, who was diagnosed with Parkinson's in 2000 at the age of 40. We are committed to supporting programs and research that deliver inspiration, information, and tools that will enable people with Parkinson's to take more control in managing their disease.
