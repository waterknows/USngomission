Founded in 1957, Kansas City Ballet is a 28-member professional ballet company under the direction of Artistic Director William Whitener and Executive Director Jeffrey J. Bentley. Kansas City Ballet performs three mixed repertory seasons per year as well as the ever-popular Nutcracker. The company also reaches over 15,000 Kansas City students and adults each year through its community education programs and provides dance training through the Kansas City Ballet School.

Our new home, Kansas City Ballet's Todd Bolender Center for Dance & Creativity, which opened August 2011, in conjunction with our new stage at the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts, is poised to make Kansas City AND Kansas City Ballet a true destination for dance.
