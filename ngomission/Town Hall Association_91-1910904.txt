Town Hall is Seattle's community cultural center, offering a broad program of music, humanities, civic discourse, and world culture events. Local, national, and international programs and performances are scheduled year-round in the Great Hall, in the Public Room, and Downstairs at Town Hall. Many of Seattle's cultural and civic organizations use the facility for a busy schedule of concerts, lectures, meetings, and fundraising events. Town Hall's mission is to serve as a common home for dozens of Seattle's midsized nonprofit organizations.
