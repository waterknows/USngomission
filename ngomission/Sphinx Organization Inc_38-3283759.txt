The Sphinx Organization was founded in 1996 to help overcome the cultural stereotype of classical music, and to encourage the participation of blacks and Latinos in the field. Our mission is to transform lives through the power of diversity in the arts. Since our founding, Sphinx has reached over 100,000 students with educational sessions and more than two million individuals through national broadcasts; provided over $300,000 in instruments to young musicians; awarded over $2 million to competition semi-finalists; and facilitated over 260 orchestral appearances.
