Established in 1987, Camp John Marc partners with community and health professionals and organizations to provide high quality camping experiences year round to campers who have a chronic illness or physical disability and the families of those children. These experiences are motivated by the belief that every camper has the right to discovery and adventure in nature's world, and deserves a chance to see, touch, play, and feel better. Camp John Marc utilizes community and medical volunteers to provide program support and quality medical care and treatment in the camp setting.
