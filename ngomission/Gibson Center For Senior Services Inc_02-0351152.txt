The Gibson Center for Senior Services has provided services to senior citizens of Northern Carroll County since 1979. Our goal is to enable seniors to remain in their homes, while maintaining a high level of independence and quality of life through the offering of an evolving array of programs and services. Our programs are designed to serve the needs of these active and passive senior residents through nutrition programs (home delivery, congregate meals and nutrition education), transportation programs for the elderly and disabled to help meet their daily living needs, social and educational programs to enable them to stay actively involved in their communities with purpose and dignity, and referral and networking programs with related community service agencies.
