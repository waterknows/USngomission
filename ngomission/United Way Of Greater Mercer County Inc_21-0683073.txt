United Way of Greater Mercer County's (UWGMC) mission is to improve people's lives by mobilizing the caring power of community. UWGMC was created in 1994 as a result of a merger of Delaware Valley United Way (founded in 1936) and United Way - Princeton Area Communities (founded in 1938). We identify and prioritize the human care issues in our area to create a Community Impact Agenda that focuses our energy and resources in three specific areas: helping children succeed; fostering self-sufficiency; and caring for seniors and people with disabilities.
