Wellstone Action Fund believes that politics shouldn't be about money and power games; it should be about the improvement of people's lives. We believe that electoral politics, public policy, and grassroots organizing can be woven together to create progressive change. Today, Wellstone Action is the largest training center for progressives in the country. More than 350 organizations have partnered with us to advance progressive change on the issues we all care about; more than 55,000 candidates, campaign staff, and community organizers have turned to us to learn how to run and win progressive campaigns, and trusted us to teach them the key to creating long-term, lasting change in our communities.
