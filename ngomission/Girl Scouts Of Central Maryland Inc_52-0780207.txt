The Girl Scouts of Central Maryland (GSCM) is an inclusive organization dedicated to the growth and empowerment of all girls so they become confident, courageous, strong and successful women. Girl Scouting builds girls of courage, confidence and character who make the world a better place. With a personal commitment to purposeful interaction between girls, volunteers, staff and board members, we are able to provide a girl-centered program, grounded by the Girl Scout mission and Promise and Law. GSCM serves nearly 30,000 girls ages 5-17 in Baltimore City, Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Carroll, Harford and Howard counties.
