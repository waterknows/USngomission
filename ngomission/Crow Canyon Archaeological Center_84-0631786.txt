Founded in 1983, the Crow Canyon Archaeological Center is dedicated to understanding, teaching, and helping to preserve the rich history of the ancestral Pueblo people (also called the Anasazi) of the American Southwest. We conduct long-term archaeological research into the ancestral Pueblo Indians of the American Southwest, with a focus on the Mesa Verde region in southwestern Colorado. We also teach the public about archaeology, history, and culture through a variety of hands-on experiences.
