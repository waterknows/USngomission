The Cincinnati Parks Foundation's mission is to build broad-based private/public partnerships supporting the conservation and enhancement of our City's parks and green spaces. The Foundation provides beautiful, tranquil places where families can exercise and relax, children can play, and the splendor of nature can soothe and nurture our souls as individuals and a community. Cincinnati Parks constitutes more than 5,000 acres, which amounts to approximately 10 percent of the City's total land area.
