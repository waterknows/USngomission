Learning Ally, a national non-profit founded in 1948, serves thousands of K-12, college and graduate students, as well as veterans and lifelong learners-- all of whom cannot read standard print due to blindness, visual impairment, dyslexia, or other learning disabilities. Through its support programs and digital library of over 80,000 human-read audiobooks, Learning Ally enables families and schools to manage the needs of students with reading disabilities.
