United Way of Warren County, Ohio works to improve lives by connecting people, organizations and resources to meet the needs of the community. We have been hard at work doing just that since we were founded in 1970. For over 40 years we have been improving lives by providing the local resources needed by local social service agencies to serve local people. The local resources we mobilize to help local people includes an annual fundraising campaign that now generates over $1.9 million each year.
