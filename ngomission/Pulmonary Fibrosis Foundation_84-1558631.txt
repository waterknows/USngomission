Founded in 2000 by brothers Albert Rose and Michael Rosenzweig, PhD, the Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation is dedicated to identifying effective PF treatments and assisting those living with the disease. The mission of the Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation is to serve as the trusted resource for the pulmonary fibrosis community by raising awareness and providing disease education. By actively engaging the PF community, the Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation has developed essential programs available to those living and working with pulmonary fibrosis. We are proud to serve as the leading patient advocacy organization of pulmonary fibrosis and are committed to funding research to find effective therapies and, hopefully one day, a cure.
