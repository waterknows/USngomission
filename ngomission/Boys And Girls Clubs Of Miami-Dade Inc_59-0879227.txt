Boys & Girls Clubs of Miami-Dade inspires and enables young people, especially those who need us most, to reach their full potential as productive, caring and responsible citizens. Boys & Girls Club is a place designed solely for youth programs and activities. Clubs are open every day, after school and on weekends, when kids have free time and need positive, productive outlets. Every Club has full-time, trained youth development professionals, providing positive role models and mentors. Volunteers provide key supplementary support. Clubs reach out to kids who cannot afford, or may lack access to other community programs.
