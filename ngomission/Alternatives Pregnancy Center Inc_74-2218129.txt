Alternatives Pregnancy Center exists to care for Denver-area women and men in pregnancy-related crises and offer them a meaningful alternative to abortion. Following the example of Christian love, we seek to meet emotional, physical and spiritual needs, enabling and encouraging women and men to choose life every day. Founded in 1982 as a faith-based organization, our goal is to counsel and live the gospel in front of one woman at a time and to preserve the life of one baby at a time. We offer women alternatives to abortion by providing practical care for them and their families through comprehensive education, counseling, material assistance, and referrals.
