The Institute for Rehabilitation and Research (TIRR) Foundation seeks to improve the lives of people who have sustained central nervous system damage through injury or disease. TIRR Foundation created, directs and funds Mission Connect, a collaborative neurotrauma research project. Mission Connect is focused on the discovery of preventions, treatments and cures for central nervous system damage caused by brain injuries, spinal cord injuries, and neurodegenerative diseases. TIRR Foundation also supports youth programs including a summer camp and sports team for wheelchair dependent children. To aid with the rehabilitation of patients, TIRR Foundation provides funding to purchase critical equipment within one of Houston's premier rehabilitation outpatient clinics.
