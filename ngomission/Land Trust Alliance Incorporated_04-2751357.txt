The Land Trust Alliance works to save the places people love by strengthening land conservation across America. Founded in 1982, we work with the national land conservation community - comprised of 1.5 million dedicated land conservation professionals, volunteers and supporters - to quickly, effectively and permanently save our most valued natural places across America. The Land Trust Alliance believes that if we focus our combined efforts to increase the pace, quality and permanence of conservation, we can turn the tide and ultimately change the way that land development takes place in America. Today, the result of our work has been the creation of a vibrant, national movement of 1,700 organizations which has now conserved over 37 million acres.
