American Nonsmokers' Rights Foundation (ANR Foundation) is a non-lobbying, educational organization which creates comprehensive programs for youth of all ages on issues of smoking prevention, the benefits of smoke free air, and the right to breathe smoke free air. The sister organization to Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights, the ANR Foundation provides educational resources for schools, health departments, medical organizations, and others interested in the issues surrounding smoking and secondhand smoke. Our goals are to raise a smokefree generation that rejects tobacco use and tobacco industry manipulation and interference tactics, and to educate the community about the health effects of secondhand smoke and the benefits of smokefree environments.
