CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocates) of the Pikes Peak Region trains and supervises volunteers to represent the best interests of our most vulnerable citizens, victims of child abuse, neglect, and severe domestic conflict. CASA volunteers are appointed by judges to be a voice for these children in court and in the community. The desired result is that children are placed into safe, loving homes where they can thrive. We offer a variety of programs and services designed to meet the special needs of vulnerable children. Among them are the: Dependency and Neglect (child abuse) Program and Supervised Exchange and Parenting Time (SEPT) Program. CASA of the Pikes Peak Region, now in its 25th Anniversary year, serves approximately 1,000 children annually.
