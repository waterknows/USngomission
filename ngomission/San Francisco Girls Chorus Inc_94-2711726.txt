The mission of the San Francisco Girls Chorus (SFGC) is to create outstanding performances featuring the unique and compelling sound of young women's voices through an exemplary music education program. Our vision is to provide music education for girls and young women from all ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds and to give the students who participate in Chorus programs the skills, self-discipline and confidence to succeed in music and in life. SFGC strives to be a leader in all aspects of choral music. Founded in 1978, the San Francisco Girls Chorus is a regional center for music education and choral training for girls and young women, ages 7-18. More than 300 students participate in this internationally recognized program. SFGC is committed to economic and ethnic diversity, and 32% of students receive scholarships.
