Founded in 1975, Investigative Reporters and Editors works to foster excellence in investigative journalism, which is essential to a free society. We accomplish this by providing training, resources and a community of support to investigative journalists; promoting high professional standards; and protecting the rights of investigative journalists. IRE provides members access to thousands of reporting tip sheets and other materials through its resource center and hosts conferences and specialized training throughout the country. Programs of IRE include the National Institute for Computer Assisted Reporting, DocumentCloud and the Campus Coverage Project.
