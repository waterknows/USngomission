In the words of its founder, the Corcoran Gallery of Art is "dedicated to art." Its museum presents, interprets and preserves the art of our times and of times past; its college of art nurtures and helps shape new generations of artists and designers. Education is a central focus, not just in the Corcoran's classrooms but in its galleries and throughout the greater Washington region. Though American art is the collection's emphasis, the art of other nations and cultures is, when appropriate, acquired and exhibited. Founded in 1869, the Corcoran is committed to making the historic art in its collections and the emerging art of our time accessible and understandable to the broadest possible audience through innovative exhibitions and educational programming, systematic research and rigorous scholarship.
