Co-founded by Helen Keller, AFB is a national nonprofit whose programs and services meet the needs of people who are blind or visually impaired. We advocate for laws and policies that support those with vision loss, develop and promote universally accessible technology, and provide leadership and training to organizations and professionals serving people with vision loss. In addition, we ensure that people with vision loss and their families have up-to-date information about career opportunities, mobility and much more.
