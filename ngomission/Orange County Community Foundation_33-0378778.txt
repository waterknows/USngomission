The Orange County Community Foundation connects donors and nonprofit agencies working towards a common goal: to improve the quality of life for our community. Our service-driven approach drives every action and decision. Simply stated, we make it easy for donors to grant effective and enduring gifts to charitable organizations whether in Orange County, the U.S. or the world. In addition, we partner with nonprofit agencies serving our community, and professional advisors counseling clients on estate and legacy plans.
