The Food Group's (formerly Emergency Foodshelf Network) mission is to be an innovative foodbank dedicated to serving the hunger needs of our changing communities.Established in 1976, The Food Group collects, warehouses and distributes high quality food and essential support services to Minnesota hunger relief organizations. The Food Group was created to help food shelves pool their resources and receive quantities of food equal to their demand. Before The Food Group was formed, it was not uncommon for one food shelf to experience an excess of resources while a neighboring shelf turned clients away due to lack of food or money. The Food Group's network consists of 230+ hunger relief programs throughout 27 Minnesota counties. These agencies provide more than seven million pounds of nonperishable, perishable and prepared food to hunger relief organizations annually.
