For six decades, the Huntington Museum of Art has been defined by a vision, a vision of bringing the world of art to the people of West Virginia and the Tri-State region. That vision, nurtured by the generosity of museum founders and supporters, has led to the creation of a truly distinguished museum, the finest in the state and the largest between Cincinnati, Pittsburgh and Richmond. It boasts an exceptional collection, innovative exhibitions and educational programs, a landmark facility, and an extraordinary 52-acre site where art and nature blend in harmony.
