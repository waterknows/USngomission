Founded in 1997, Alpha USA is a network of people, churches and organizations who are seeking to fulfill the Great Commission to "go and make disciples of all nations." Matthew 28:18-20. We promote, support and serve as a resource for the spread of the Alpha Course but also have tools and resources for discipleship, deeper spiritual growth and family life with The Marriage Course, The Marriage Preparation Course and Parenting Courses.
