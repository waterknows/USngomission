The mission of Pittsburgh Public Theater (PPT) is to provide artistically diverse theatrical experiences of the highest quality. Sharing its resources with the community through education and outreach initiatives, the PPT works to expand and diversify the audience while enriching the community. PPT was founded in 1974, after a decade in which the city had become known nationally as an unenthusiastic theater town. The O'Reilly Theater, designed by world-renowned architect Michael Graves, is the home of PPT. Located in the heart of Pittsburgh's Cultural District, the intimate and state-of-the-art performance facility boasts 650 seats in the unique thrust stage configuration which allows the audience to be seated on three sides - offering an up-close and exciting experience for audience and actors alike.
