Founded in 1982, Memorial Assistance Ministries' mission is to assure that families have the means to meet their basic needs. To carry out that mission, we assist families facing financial crisis to avoid homelessness, offer programs to enable long-term financial self-sufficiency, assure children an improved school experience, facilitate client access to other support networks, and enhance MAM's value to its member congregations and the community. MAM clients live or work in Houstonâ€˜s central and close-in West and Northwest neighborhoods such as the Heights, Spring Branch, Acres Homes, Memorial, Jersey Village and more
