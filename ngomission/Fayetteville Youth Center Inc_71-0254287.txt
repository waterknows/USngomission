The mission of the Donald W. Reynolds Boys & Girls Club is to serve the youth of our community by providing social, physical, academic, cultural and family experiences in a safe environment and to help develop a value system that will improve the quality of their lives and lead them to become productive citizens. The Club currently serves over 10,000 community members per year through memberships, special events, facility reservations and drop-in business. Formerly known as the Fayetteville Youth Center, the Club has nearly 70 years of service to youth and families in the local community.
