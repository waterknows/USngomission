In 2001, United Way of Santa Fe County (UWSFC) adopted "creating lasting change in chronic community conditions" as its mission. After an extensive needs assessment, UWSFC launched the Santa Fe Children's Project (SFCP). The SFCP is an innovative community development initiative that seeks to strengthen families, and the whole community, though a sequential pipeline of early intervention, education, and development opportunities. In its full implementation, families with young children will participate in a wide array of opportunities: social, educational, economic, and community development programs that, taken together, can change the academic, social, and economic conditions of the whole community leading to greatly increased community assets, family strengths, and, ultimately, greater success in children.
