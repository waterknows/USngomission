Founded in 1999, Cincinnati Works partners with willing and capable people living in poverty to assist them in advancing to economic self-sufficiency through employment. Using a holistic approach, we offer access to area employers while providing comprehensive support services. We serve two clients: those individuals in the community who are currently unemployed or underemployed (i.e. the working poor) and employers who have entry- & mid-level positions.
