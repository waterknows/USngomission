In times of need, in times of plenty and in times of change, the Jewish Federation and Community Foundation of the East Bay reaches across our community to bring together donors, communal agencies, synagogues and others to unite our values, strengthen our community and make a greater impact through giving. Guided by our Jewish values of tzedakah (righteous giving), chesed (loving kindness) and tikkun olam (repairing the world), the Jewish Federation works to help build a vibrant and inclusive local Jewish community; support organizations and programs that address the needs of our Jewish family; and connect philanthropists with giving opportunities that match their vision, values and goals.
