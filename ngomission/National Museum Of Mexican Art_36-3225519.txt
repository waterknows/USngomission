Founded in 1982, the National Museum of Mexican Art works to stimulate and preserve knowledge and appreciation of Mexican culture through sponsoring events and exhibitions that exemplify the rich variety of visual and performing arts in the Mexican culture; to develop a significant permanent collection of Mexican art; to encourage the professional development of Mexican artists; and to offer arts education programs. The National Museum of Mexican Art is the nation's largest Latino arts institution and the only Latino museum accredited by the American Association of Museums.
