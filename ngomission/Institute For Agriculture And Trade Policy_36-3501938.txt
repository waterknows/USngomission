Since 1986, the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy (IATP) has worked locally and globally at the intersection of policy and practice to ensure fair and sustainable food, farm and trade systems. IATP works with organizations around the world to analyze how global trade agreements impact domestic farm and food policies. Alongside a global coalition, IATP advocates for fair trade policies that promote strong health standards, labor and human rights, the environment and, most fundamentally, democratic institutions. IATP is developing alternative economic models that include clean sources of energy that would spur rural development, as well as monitoring the impact of genetically-engineered crops, and working to stop the overuse of antibiotics in agriculture and aquaculture.
