The mission of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Bay County is to inspire and enable all young people, especially those who need us most, to realize their full potential as productive, responsible and caring citizens. For over 42 years the Boys & Girls Clubs of Bay County have been in the forefront of youth development, working with young people from disadvantaged economic, social, and family circumstances. The Clubs have actively sought to enrich the lives of young people who other youth agencies have failed to reach. We are dedicated to ensuring that our community's young people have greater access to quality programs and services that will enhance lives and shape their futures.
