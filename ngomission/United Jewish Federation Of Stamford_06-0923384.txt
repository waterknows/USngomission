Founded in 1972, the United Jewish Federation (UJF) of Greater Stamford, New Canaan and Darien is committed to unifying the Jewish community through planning and coordination of community resources, support of Jewish education for all ages, a strong fundraising campaign and judicious allocations. Central to UJF's mission is a community built on the Jewish ideal of tzedakah: charity, righteousness and social justice. Our support for the programs of our local agencies and the humanitarian work of the United Jewish Communities throughout the world enriches local, national and international Jewish life.
