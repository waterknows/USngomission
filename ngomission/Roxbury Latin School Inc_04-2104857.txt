Founded in 1645, the Roxbury Latin School is a boys' school by conviction with a curriculum tailored to the cognitive and emotional development of boys. We build on their intellectual curiosity, self-motivation, and capacity for hard work. Ours is a democratically gathered community, in which boys from a broad array of socioeconomic backgrounds and with different interests, talents, and perspectives, are admitted and enrolled on a need-blind basis, regardless of their family's financial circumstances. Our small size ensures that each boy is known and loved. Current enrollment is 290 boys in grades 7-12; the student-faculty ratio is 8:1.
