The International Center is a Washington, DC based organization founded in 1977 to focus on issues between the United States and the developing world. Over the years the International Center has had projects in Asia, Africa, Latin America and with the former Soviet Union. The International Center has two core programs, the New Forests Project and the U.S.-Vietnam Trade Council Education Forum. The New Forests Project works to support renewable and self-sustaining grassroots efforts in agro forestry, reforestation, protection of watersheds, water and sanitation, and global climate change issues. The U.S.-Vietnam Trade Council's Education Forum works to provide assistance in the US and Vietnam to enhance understanding of the trade policy issues that affect Vietnam's goal of global integration, membership in WTO, APEC, and ASEAN and in bi-lateral relations.
