Ocean Discovery Institute empowers urban and diverse young people to protect our ocean and natural environment, improve the health of our communities, and strengthen our quality of life. Founded in 1999, we were created to leverage San Diego's natural environments as a means to engage young people from underserved communities and inspire them to become part of the next generation of scientific and environmental leaders. We spearhead a series of initiatives that incorporate education, scientific research, and environmental stewardship. Currently these initiatives reach 5,000+ low-income students and community members each year. All of our programming is provided tuition-free.
