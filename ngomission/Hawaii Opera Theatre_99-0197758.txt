Founded in 1960, the Hawaii Opera Theatre's (HOT) mission is to educate the public about and support the cultural development of opera in Hawaii. Today, HOT is known for its vibrant and creative productions. Artistic excellence continues to be the cornerstone of standards for the company. International artists, who have graced stages from the New York Met to opera houses throughout Europe and Asia, compete up to three years in advance to perform on the HOT stage along side Hawaii's best local artists. Our nationally recognized education outreach program reaches more than 25,000 students on Oahu and Neighbor Islands annually.
