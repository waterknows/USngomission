Boston Children's Chorus envisions a city defined by meaningful relationships among its community members. Through participation in a rigorous choral curriculum supplemented with lessons to foster compassion, BCC singers will use the shared experience of music to create a better understanding of their part in the world around them. BCC is in pursuit of musical excellence, which the organization believes can be used as a tool to create dialogue around difficult issues. By encouraging conversations around these issues, our singers pave the way for a more connected Boston and leading to creative social integration.
