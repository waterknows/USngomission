Washington Trails Association (WTA) is the voice for hikers in Washington state. WTA protects hiking trails and wild lands, takes thousands of volunteers out to maintain trails, and promotes hiking as a healthy, fun way to explore Washington. WTA's volunteer trail maintenance program is among the largest in the nation, with 3,550 volunteers giving back more than 120,000 hours of service annually to the trails they love--and getting a good dose of personal reward in return. Washington Trails Association protects trails through lobbying and grassroots advocacy on issues that impact hikers, like trail funding and wilderness protection. We work closely with federal and state policymakers to advance hiker's interests in forest planning and new recreation projects.
