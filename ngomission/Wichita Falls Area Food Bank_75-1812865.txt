Targeting a population in 12 counties that provide food to over 74,000 individuals, the Wichita Falls Area Food Bank provides hunger relief through distribution of food through a network of over 205 agencies and programs. We distributed 3.7 million pounds of food in 2014 which equates to over 3.1 million meals. Some of the points of distribution include: Food pantries, which distribute bags of food that can be used to prepare meals at home - Feeding sites, where hot meals are served in a communal setting - Shelters for the homeless and abuse - 	Programs that serve hungry children and the elderly - as well as other agencies, such as rehabilitation program and disaster relief.
