Founded in 1980, Ashoka strives to shape a global, entrepreneurial, competitive citizen sector: one that allows social entrepreneurs to thrive and enables the world's citizens to think and act as changemakers. Ashoka envisions a world where everyone is a changemaker: a world that responds quickly and effectively to social challenges, and where each individual has the freedom, confidence and societal support to address any social problem and drive change. Ashoka works by supporting individual social entrepreneurs, bringing communities of social entrepreneurs together, and building infrastructure and financial systems to support the growth of the citizen sector and facilitate the spread of social innovation globally.
