Founded in 1997, Locks of Love provides hairpieces to financially disadvantaged children under age 21 suffering from long-term medical hair loss from any diagnosis. Our mission is to return a sense of self, confidence and normalcy to children suffering from hair loss by utilizing donated ponytails to provide the highest quality hair prosthetics to financially disadvantaged children. The children receive hair prostheses free of charge or on a sliding scale, based on financial need. Most of our children suffer from an autoimmune disorder called alopecia areata, which causes the hair follicles to shut down. Other recipients have been victim to severe burns, endured radiation treatment to the brain stem as a treatment for cancer, or suffer from any number of skin disorders that cause permanent hair loss.
