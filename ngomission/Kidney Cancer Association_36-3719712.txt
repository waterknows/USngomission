Founded in 1990, the Kidney Cancer Association (KCA) is a charitable organization made up of patients, family members, physicians, researchers, and other health professionals globally. We fund, promote, and collaborate with the National Cancer Institute, American Society for Clinical Oncology, American Urological Association, and other institutions on research projects. We educate families and physicians, and serve as an advocate on behalf of patients at the state and federal levels. We encourage both private and public sector institutions to do more research on kidney cancer, and we help researchers in academic medical centers, government, and industry with money and information.
