Founded in 1999 by environmental attorney and activist Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and several veteran Waterkeepers, Waterkeeper Alliance is a global movement of on-the-water advocates who patrol and protect over 100,000 miles of rivers, streams and coastlines in North and South America, Europe, Australia, Asia and Africa. Waterkeepers defend their communities against anyone who threatens their right to clean water - from law-breaking polluters to unresponsive government agencies. Made up of nearly 200 local Waterkeeper organizations, Waterkeeper Alliance keeps Waterkeepers connected, provides them with legal, scientific and communications support, and unites their voices as they take on major global water issues together.
