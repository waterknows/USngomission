BEAMS provides Bibles to missionaries around the world at no cost to the missionary. Bibles are printed in various foreign languages to be given to citizens of the foreign land by missionaries spreading the gospel of Jesus Christ. We raise funds through offerings from local, independent, Bible-believing Baptist churches to purchase and supply whole, hardback Bibles for missionaries to give to those who are saved on the foreign mission fields. Since 1997, under Dr. Freret's leadership, the BEAMS ministry has grown from supplying 50 Bibles a month to up to 10,000... from serving 12 missionaries to over 3,000 missionaries and national workers... and from three countries to more than 130 countries around the world!
