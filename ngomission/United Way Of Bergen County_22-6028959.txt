Bergen County's United Way has served our community for 52 years. We fulfill our mission by providing help that is direct, concrete and timely to the most vulnerable residents in our community and by developing programs and financial resources that address unmet needs. Our operating costs, at only 9%, are half those of many other nonprofits, which means your contribution goes directly to help people in concrete and vital ways. Our services include:- 2-1-1: the United Way's 24-hour statewide service answering every call or click for help, 24 hours a day. It is a system that is free and easy to use - think 9-1-1 emergencies, 2-1-1 everything else. - The Compassion Fund: direct financial assistance to help when no one else can to ensure that the most basic needs are met for people in crisis. - Housing Works: helping neighbors build communities with the creation of new and affordable housing for low income families, senior citizens and adults with special needs.
