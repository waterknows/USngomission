The Jewish Hospice and Chaplaincy Network (JHCN) partners with hospices, hospitals and health care agencies to provide patient advocacy and support services to meet the cultural and spiritual needs of Jewish patients and their families. Since our inception ten years ago, JHCN has become a healthcare leader in Southeast Michigan, providing educational seminars on issues related to chronic illness and end-of-life care.
