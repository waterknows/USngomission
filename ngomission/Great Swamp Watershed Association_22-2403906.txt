Formed in 1981, the Great Swamp Watershed Association (GSWA) is a member-supported environmental organization that monitors and protects water quality, and investigates and participates in land use issues in the watershed community, while working to strengthen environmental regulations in New Jersey. GSWA also provides environmental education to community groups, teachers and students to help everyone understand the important role we each play in protecting our drinking water and preserving the natural beauty of our environment. Although the organization's work is centered primarily within the towns physically located in the watershed, the results of this work extend to the more than one million people who obtain their drinking water from the Passaic River.
