Audubon Canyon Ranch (ACR) was founded in 1962 to save one of the largest heronries on the west coast and to prevent intensive commercial development in the pristine area surrounding the colony. ACR preserves, protects and manages our properties as sanctuaries for native plants and animals. ACR educates children and adults about the natural environment and the need to protect it, through the use and enjoyment of our sanctuaries. We also support research and conservation efforts that enhance the preservation and management of the natural resources of our sanctuaries.
