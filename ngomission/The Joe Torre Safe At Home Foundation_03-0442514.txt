The Joe Torre Safe At Home Foundation was founded in 2002 by Ali and Joe Torre to educate children to end the cycle of domestic violence and save lives. The Foundation aims to educate children about the issue of domestic violence. In 2005, the Foundation opened its first school-based programming initiative, Margaret's Place, at Hostos-Lincoln Academy, Bronx, NY. Margaret's Place, a tribute to his mom, is a comprehensive program which provides students with a safe room in school where they can meet with a professional counselor trained in domestic-violence intervention and prevention. Currently there are ten fully funded and operational Margaret's Places in metropolitan New York City and Los Angeles, California.
