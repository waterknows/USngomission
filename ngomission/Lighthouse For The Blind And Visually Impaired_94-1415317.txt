LightHouse for the Blind and Visually Impaired is the largest agency providing direct service, advocacy and information to the blind and visually impaired community of Northern California. LightHouse for the Blind's mission is to promote the equality and self-reliance of people who are blind or visually impaired through rehabilitation training, employment placement, Enchanted Hills Camp and other relevant services. Since 1902, our classes, community engagements, and advocacy have enabled blind people to live independent and richly rewarding lives across the United States. We own and operate Enchanted Hills Camp for the Blind, located in Napa, California, which reaches the blind world wide.
