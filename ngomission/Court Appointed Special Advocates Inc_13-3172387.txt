CASA-NYC provides one-on-one advocacy for children and youth in foster care. Launched in 1979, our primary mission is to protect the needs and well-being of this most vulnerable population, seeking appropriate treatment intervention and timely case resolution. CASA originally worked out of a single room in the Manhattan Family Courthouse. We have since expanded our offices to Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx, and currently serve all five boroughs. All children deserve to grow up in safe, permanent homes where they can thrive. CASA plays a vital role in making this happen. Our staff recruit and train volunteer advocates to provide individualized attention to each child in need. Most important, CASA gives voice to the child in court.
