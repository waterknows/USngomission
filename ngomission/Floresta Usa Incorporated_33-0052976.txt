Plant With Purpose (formerly known as Floresta USA) is a Christian organization which reverses deforestation and poverty in the world by transforming the lives of the rural poor. Plant With Purpose and its Dominican sister organization, Floresta Incorporada, were founded in 1984 out of a new vision for economic development that would be sustainable and benefit the environment. Plant With Purpose sought to make lasting change through development that restored productivity to degraded land and dignity to the rural poor, while providing opportunities for upcoming generations. Currently there are over 17,132 families who are benefiting from Plant With Purpose's program in Haiti, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Thailand, Burundi, and Tanzania through training in sustainable agriculture, reforestation, community-based microfinance, spiritual renewal, capacity building, and marketing assistance.
