Tulsa Habitat for Humanity is a part of a global, non-profit housing organization operated on Christian principles that seeks to put God's love into action by building homes, communities and hope. Tulsa Habitat for Humanity is dedicated to eliminating substandard housing locally and world wide through constructing, rehabilitating and preserving homes; by advocating for fair and just housing policies; and by providing training and access to resources to help families improve their shelter conditions. Habitat for Humanity was founded on the conviction that every man, woman and child should have a simple, durable place to live in dignity and safety, and that decent shelter in decent communities should be a matter of conscience and action for all.
