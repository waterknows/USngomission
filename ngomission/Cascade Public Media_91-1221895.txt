Since 1954, KCTS has continuously served Seattle and the Pacific Northwest. We have grown to be an independent, thriving station, annually broadcasting over 26,000 hours of programs that inspire viewers to expand their points of view, that inform citizens of the state of our nation, and that involve individuals in their community. KCTS Television operates KCTS 9 and KYVE 47, providing three, 24/7 digital channels in Western and Central Washington, plus KCTS 9 HD through Shaw Cable in British Columbia. Our mission is to improve the quality of life in the communities we serve by providing meaningful programming on air, online and in the community that informs, involves and inspires.
