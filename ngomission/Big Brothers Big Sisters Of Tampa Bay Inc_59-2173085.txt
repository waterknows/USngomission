Big Brothers Big Sisters of Tampa Bay helps children reach their potential through professionally supported, one-to-one relationships with measurable impact. Our vision for the future includes successful mentoring relationships for all children who need and want them, contributing to better schools, brighter futures and stronger communities for all. Our volunteers are the positive role models so vitally important to a child at risk of failing in school or of engaging in harmful behavior. In 2008 we matched 2,250 children with an adult mentor. On January 1, 2015, Big Brothers Big Sisters of Tampa Bay merged with Big Brothers Big Sisters of Pinellas County.
