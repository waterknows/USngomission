The Alliance for School Choice works improve our nation's K-12 education by advancing systemic and sustainable public policy that empowers parents, particularly those in low-income families, to choose the education they determine is best for their children. In collaboration with a host of national and state allies, we create opportunities for systemic and sustainable educational reform that puts parents in charge. The Alliance for School Choice works to build support for, and implement, publicly funded school choice programs that provide low-income families with educational opportunities.
