Founded in 1841, the Punahou School is a coeducational college preparatory day school in Honolulu, Hawaii. We are committed to providing an environment where students can develop moral and spiritual values consistent with Christian principles; develop intellectual, academic and physical potential to the fullest degree, preparing students for college and for challenges facing them now and in the future; develop and enhance creativity and appreciation of the arts; and appreciate cultural diversity and develop social responsibility. Designed originally to provide a quality education to the children of Congregational missionaries, today we enroll over 3,750 students. We are nonsectarian but retain our Christian heritage.
