Community Partners of Dallas was established in 1989 by a committed group of Dallas County individuals. Initially the purpose was to determine how the community could support Child Protective Services. Community Partners of Dallas is dedicated to ensuring safety and restoring dignity and hope to abused and neglected children by providing resources and support to the caseworkers of Dallas County Child Protective Services. Community Partners of Dallas served more than 20,000 children last year through five unique programs.
