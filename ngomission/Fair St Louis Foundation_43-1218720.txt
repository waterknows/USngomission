Since 1981, the Fair Saint Louis Foundation (formerly the Veiled Prophet Fair Foundation)- in partnership with the City of St. Louis and the National Park Service- has hosted a spectacular celebration featuring live music, educational activities, air shows and spectacular fireworks over the Fourth of July weekend. The name Fair Saint Louis acknowledges that this free event is produced by Saint Louisans as a gift for Saint Louisans and their guests from all over the world.
