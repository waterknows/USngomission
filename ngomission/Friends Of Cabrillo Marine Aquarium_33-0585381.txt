The mission of Friends of Cabrillo Marine Aquarium is to provide a vehicle for friends, volunteers and supporters of Cabrillo Marine Aquarium (CMA) to meaningfully support the educational, charitable, scientific and other related activities and affairs of the Aquarium. With its spectacular natural setting adjacent to Cabrillo Beach Coastal Park and the Port of Los Angeles, CMA is uniquely suited to its leadership role in marine science education, aquaculture research and community recreation. The historic Frank Gehry-designed aquarium displays the largest collection of Southern California marine life in the world. Since 1935, CMA has provided visitors with both a natural and interactive approach to learning about the marine environment of Southern California.
