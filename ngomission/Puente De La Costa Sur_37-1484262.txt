Puente is an integral and active member of our rural San Mateo County South Coast communityâ€”a community that is healthy, inclusive, and sustainable, with diverse populations that accomplish their highest individual and community dreams. As the region's only Community Resource Center, Puente serves the San Mateo County South Coast communities of Pescadero, La Honda, Loma Mar, and San Gregorio. Puente both advocates for our communities and leverages resources that foster economic prosperity and security, and that promote individual and community health and wellness. We support local leaders and work together with our neighbors creating solutions for our diverse communities.
