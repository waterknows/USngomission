The Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy (MCEA) is a nonprofit organization using law, science, and research to protect Minnesota's natural resources, wildlife and the health of its people. Since our founding in 1974, we have advocated for sound environmental policies which provide positive, long-term solutions to the most critical environmental issues facing Minnesota. At the heart of our mission is a reverence for nature and a fundamental commitment to sustain and enhance environmental quality for the benefit of future generations.
