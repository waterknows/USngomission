Rebuilding Together Silicon Valley is an organization that performs free home accessibility and safety repairs/modifications for older adults and disabled homeowners in Santa Clara County. We also serve other non-profit organizations so that they can dedicate their resources to the community rather than to facility repair. Since our establishment in 1991, Rebuilding Together Silicon Valley has renovated over 1,000 homes and community facilities. The majority of the low-income homeowners we serve are elderly or disabled individuals or residents who are physically and financially unable to maintain safe and warm living conditions for themselves and their families. Repair and maintenance work for non-profit facilities assists these organizations to direct their resources to help our community.
