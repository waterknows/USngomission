The mission of Special Olympics Maryland (SOMD) is to provide year-round sports training and athletic competition in a variety of Olympic-type sports for citizens with intellectual disabilities, giving them continuing opportunities to develop physical fitness, demonstrate courage, experience joy and participate in a sharing of gifts, skills and friendship with their families, other Special Olympics athletes and the community. The vision of SOMD is to help bring their athletes into the larger society under conditions whereby they are accepted, respected and given the chance to become useful and productive citizens. In addition, SOMD encourages their athletes to also become leaders and give back to others through Athlete Leadership Programs.
