Ibis Reproductive Health is an international nonprofit organization with a mission to improve women's reproductive autonomy, choices, and health worldwide. Our core activity is clinical and social science research on issues receiving inadequate attention in other research settings and where gaps in the evidence exist. Our agenda is driven by women's priorities and focuses on increasing access to safe abortion, expanding contraceptive access and choices, and integrating HIV and comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services. We partner with advocates and other stakeholders who use our research to improve policies and delivery of services in countries around the world.
