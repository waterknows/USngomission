Habitat for Humanity in the Roanoke Valley (HFHRV) is a non-profit Christian housing program utilizing donor funds and volunteer labor in its mission to eliminate poverty housing. Working in partnership with families to build decent, affordable homes, the homes are then sold with zero profit, zero interest mortgages. Mortgage payments from partner families are then combined with donations from businesses, churches, local governments, organizations, individuals and proceeds from The Habitat ReStore to offer more families the security of home-ownership.
