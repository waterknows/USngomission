Founded in 1965, Cincinnati Nature Center works to inspire passion for nature and promote environmentally responsible choices through experience, education, and stewardship to ensure a sustainable future. Cincinnati Nature Center's two sites (Rowe Woods and Long Branch Farm & Trails) comprise over 1,600 acres of irreplaceable natural and agricultural land, making it one of the top 10 nature centers in the country. Cincinnati Nature Center's education programs reach 12,000 school children each year with hands-on lessons about ecology, and help ensure responsible stewardship of the land well into the future.
