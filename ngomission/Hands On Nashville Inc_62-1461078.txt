Hands On Nashville's mission is to meet community needs through volunteerism. We connect volunteers to critical issues facing the Middle Tennessee community - like hunger, homelessness, and environmental issues - and we've been at it for more than 20 years. It all started with one Nashvillian's desire to find meaningful ways for people to volunteer back in 1991. Today, we're one of the largest volunteer resource centers in the world. In 2012, HON connected or referred 117,500 volunteers to more than 4,000 service opportunities.
