Stonecroft Ministries equips and encourages women to impact their communities with the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Stonecroft provides a variety of programs and resources designed to connect women to God, each other, and their communities. We encourage women to find creative ways to make connections with others in their communities. These may be through shared interest groups or as a result of our outreach groups and Bible studies. Stonecroft Ministries emphasizes evangelism. Though many ministries for women currently exist, only a handful focus on evangelism.
