Since 1950, the Kansas City Rescue Mission (KCRM) has helped people in need. Whether they turn to us because of bad choices, bad breaks or both, we welcome the poor, homeless, hungry and hurting. Through a proven path from relief to recovery to re-entry, KCRM offers freedom from the past and hope for the future. We believe that the love of Jesus Christ can change lives. We see it happen here every day. Good food, safe shelter, comfortable beds, clean facilities, case management, a proven recovery program, job and life-skills training; all these things and more are why hundreds of people come through our doors each year. KCRM is a Christ-centered community offering freedom and hope to the poor and homeless, empowering them to reach their full potential.
