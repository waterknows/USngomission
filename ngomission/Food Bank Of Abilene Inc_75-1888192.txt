The Food Bank of West Central Texas is a community service organization that collects donated food to distribute to other non-profit agencies serving the needy of the Big Country. The Food Bank began in early 1983 under the leadership of Sonny Hermann and John Herod. Our service area includes Brown, Callahan, Coleman, Comanche, Eastland, Fisher, Jones, Mitchell, Nolan, Runnels, Shackelford, Stephens, and Taylor counties. We will continue to serve the Big Country through innovative programs that help raise hunger awareness and feed the hungry in West Central Texas.
