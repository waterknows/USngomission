Food Lifeline has been working to end hunger in communities in Western Washington for more than 30 years and is the largest hunger-relief organization in Washington State. By using 96% of our revenue to feed hungry people, we are efficient, effective, and make the most of every donation. Last year, Food Lifeline helped feed more than 745,000 hungry people through our network of nearly 300 local food banks, meal programs, and shelters.Food Lifeline partners with large-scale food producers, retailers, and distributors to ensure that unmarketable but still edible and nutritious food ends up in the hands of hungry people rather than going to waste. Last year Food Lifeline distributed more than 35 million pounds of food to hungry people-- the equivalent of 27 million meals.
