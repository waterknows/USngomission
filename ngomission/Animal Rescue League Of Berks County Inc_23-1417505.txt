Since 1952, tens of thousands of animals have been spared the fate of uncertainty and given the opportunity to experience a more enriching and humane life through the services provided by the Animal Rescue League of Berks County, Inc (ARL). The ARL's dedication to providing shelter and care for the unwanted and abused animals of Greater Reading has resulted in a comprehensive effort to not only provide the optimum level of care, but to enhance and guarantee a humane life for over 10,000 animals annually. At any given time we care for over 175 animals a day on our 10 acre facility, many of whom require veterinary care, rehabilitation, and training. Between the months of May through September, the shelter receives an average of 900 cats and 300 dogs per month.
