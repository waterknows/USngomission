SAT-7 provides the churches and Christians of the Middle East and North Africa with an opportunity to witness to Jesus Christ through inspirational, informative, and educational television services. SAT-7 is Christian satellite television by and for the People of the Middle East and North Africa. Broadcasting a variety of indigenously produced Christian programs in Arabic, Farsi and Turkish, the ministry reaches into the homes of millions of viewers weekly with attractive, inspiring, Bible-based programs. SAT-7 is distinct from most other Christian broadcasting in the region because more than three-quarters of its programs are created in the Middle East, by local Christians, in SAT-7 production studios in Egypt and Lebanon. Over the past twelve years, SAT-7 has been instrumental in helping to bring the love of Christ to the people of the Middle East and North Africa.
