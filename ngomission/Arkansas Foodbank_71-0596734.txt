The Arkansas Foodbank has been fighting hunger in Arkansas since 1984. Last year, 2012, the Foodbank distributed 16.3 million pounds of food to our approximately 300 member agencies in central and southern Arkansas and to the state's five other regional Feeding America food banks. In 1984, hunger advocates in central Arkansas opened the Arkansas Foodbank in a storefront because local food pantries didn't have the storage space to accept truckloads of food donations. Using economies of scale, the Foodbank staff soon began acquiring and distributing the donated food more cost-effectively, splitting the loads into smaller amounts that fit the pantries' immediate needs. Since that first warehouse opened, the goal has been to distribute larger and larger quantities of food.
