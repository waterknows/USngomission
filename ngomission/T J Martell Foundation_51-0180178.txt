The T.J. Martell Foundation funds innovative, early stage cancer and AIDS research that leads to practical, effective treatments in the near term. We provide funds for highly targeted research projects at leading medical and scientific institutions. The Foundation is dedicated to funding and supporting the efforts of scientists and physicians engaged in the global battle against multiple forms of cancer and AIDS. In addition to fighting these diseases, we also work to improve the lives of cancer and pediatric AIDS patients and their families. Founded in 1975, the organization has raised over $260 million to support medical research since that time.
