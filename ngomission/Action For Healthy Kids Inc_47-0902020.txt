Founded in 2002, Action for Healthy Kids is a public-private partnership of more than 60 national organizations and government agencies representing education, health, fitness and nutrition. We address the epidemic of overweight, sedentary, and undernourished youth by focusing on changes in schools to improve nutrition and increase physical activity. We work to engage diverse organizations, leaders, and volunteers in actions that foster sound nutrition and good physical activity in children, youth, and schools. Action for Healthy Kids envisions a world where all kids develop the lifelong habits necessary to promote health and learning.
