Gateway180 :: Homelessness Reversed is a valuable resource for women and children experiencing the unimaginable burden of homelessness. We provide safe, nurturing emergency shelter services designed to get families into transitional or permanent homes in under 30 days. Our Vision is to end homelessness in the St. Louis region one family at a time. Once clients arrive at the shelter they begin to work Gateway180's highly structured housing program. 84% of people placed into transitional or permanent supportive housing will never become homeless again. In 2011, Gateway placed 356 individuals into housing. In 2010, we placed 341 people.
