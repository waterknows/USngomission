The Hawk Mountain Council is chartered by the Boy Scouts of America to serve Berks County, Schuylkill County, and part of Carbon County, and serves nearly 6,000 youth members and over 4,000 adult leaders. Hawk Mountain Council maintains a year around camp, Hawk Mountain Scout Reservation, 700 acres of forest, lake and streams, dedicated to offering Scouts the chance to experience the beauty of the out-of-doors. These facilities are for use by Scouts and Scouters from the Hawk Mountain Council and visiting units from outside our Council. Non-Scouting groups are also welcome to utilize our facilities. In addition to year-round camping, the camp is the center for training adult leaders in the programs of Cub Scouting, Boy Scouting, Venturing and Commissioner Service.
