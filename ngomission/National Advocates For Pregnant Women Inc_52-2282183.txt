National Advocates for Pregnant Women (NAPW) seeks to protect the rights and human dignity of all women, particularly pregnant and parenting women and those who are most vulnerable including low income women, women of color, and drug-using women. NAPW uses the lessons learned from the experiences of these women to find more effective ways of advancing reproductive and human rights for all women and families. Our work encompasses legal advocacy; local and national organizing; public policy development, and public education. NAPW is actively involved in ongoing court challenges to punitive reproductive health and drug policies and provides litigation support in cases across the country. NAPW engages in local and national organizing and public education efforts among the diverse communities that are stakeholders in these issues, including the women and families directly affected by punitive policies, as well as public health and policy leaders. By focusing on the rights of all pregnant women, whether they seek to have an abortion or go to term , NAPW is broadening and strengthening the Reproductive Justice and other progressive movements. NAPW recognizes that 61% of women who have abortions are already mothers and 84% of women by the time they are in their 40's have become pregnant and given birth. We believe that you cannot have a culture of life if you do not value the women who give that life.
