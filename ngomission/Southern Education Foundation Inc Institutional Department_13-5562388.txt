The Southern Education Foundation (SEF), created in 1867, works to advance creative solutions to ensure fairness and excellence in education for all. Through a variety of programs and strategies involving research, analysis, advocacy, technical assistance, and outreach, SEF works to improve education policy and practice; inform the public about education issues and policy options; strengthen parent, school, and private sector efforts to better meet the needs of underachieving students; and to promote a high quality of universal education. SEF believes that America needs to develop the talents and contributions of all of its people in order to thrive and create a shared and prosperous future for everyone.
