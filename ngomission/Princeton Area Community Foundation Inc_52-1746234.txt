Created in 1991, the Princeton Area Community Foundation (PACF) builds community by promoting and encouraging philanthropy across greater Mercer County and central New Jersey. We do this by managing charitable funds created by members of the community, providing competitive discretionary grants to nonprofits, and by making advised grants to nonprofits after consultation with individuals or groups of donors. PACF also serves as a convener and catalyst, leveraging new funds, and creating partnerships to enable residents to solve community problems.
