Founded in 1995, Alliance for Education works to help every child in Seattle Public Schools achieve academic success. We pursue this mission by securing seed capital for innovations in learning and by fostering city-wide support for excellence in schools. We act as a constructive partner to Seattle Public Schools. We champion change and help drive effective strategies that will increase student achievement. Like a venture capital firm that invests in start-up companies, we are focused on innovations that will help students learn and grow. By engaging the greater community in a thoughtful process, we create opportunities to inspire, inform, listen to, and learn from the collective wisdom of Seattle residents.
