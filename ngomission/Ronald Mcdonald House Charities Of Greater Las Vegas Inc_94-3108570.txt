Believing that every child deserves a safe and supportive place to grow, Ronald McDonald House Charities (RMHC) of Greater Las Vegas creates and supports programs that directly improve the health, education and well-being of children in our community. The Ronald McDonald HouseÂ® is the cornerstone program of RMHC, and provides temporary housing for families who travel to Las Vegas to receive critical medical treatment for their children. The Ronald McDonald House program provides a "home-away-from-home" for families so they can stay close by their hospitalized child at little or no cost. Our House is built on the simple idea that nothing else should matter when a family is focused on healing their child - not where they can afford to stay, where they will get their next meal or where they will lay their head at night to rest.
