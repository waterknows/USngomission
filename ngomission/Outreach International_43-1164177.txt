Since 1979, Outreach International has provided sustainable solutions to help end extreme poverty around the world. Projects don't end poverty-people do. That's why our key investment is in the people themselves.



Outreach International has been working with the world's most marginalized people to create solutions to help end world poverty. We are currently working in 10 impoverished countries, reaching hundreds of thousands with our mission to create permanent change.



At Outreach International, we believe that giving a gift without educating a community to use it, repair it or cultivate it, is no gift at all; it's a quick fix to a problem that will continually resurface. And we don't want to create short-term solutions for world poverty; we want to change it forever.



By giving impoverished communities the tools they need to maintain and continue their own successes, we can change their lives for generations.
