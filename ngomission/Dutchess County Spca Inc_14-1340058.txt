Dutchess County SPCA (DCSPCA) was founded in 1871. Its mission is to rescue and provide temporary humane shelter for the abandoned, neglected and abused companion animals of the Dutchess County community. Central to our mission is the securing of caring, responsible, permanent homes for the adoptable animals in our care. We shall provide humane law enforcement throughout Dutchess County, and by example and through education, we shall promote and advance responsible, humane companion animal guardianship.
