Begun in 1939 as the Pittsburgh Opera Society, Pittsburgh Opera is the eighth oldest company in the U.S., and it draws on a rich legacy of music-making. Pittsburgh Opera enriches Pittsburgh and the tri-state area and draws national and international attention to the region by: creating live opera at the highest standards of artistic excellence; making opera intellectually and financially accessible to a diverse audience; developing young American singers into tomorrow's artists; and ensuring the future through responsible fiscal management.
