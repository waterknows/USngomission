Founded in 1933, the National Council for the Traditional Arts (NCTA) is the nation's oldest folk arts organization. The NCTA stresses quality and authenticity in presenting traditional artists to the public in festivals, national and international tours, concerts, radio and television programs, films, recordings and other programs. NCTA's work includes a nationwide touring program, the creation and programming of large-scale festivals and special events, the planning of cultural programs in National Parks, and numerous other activities. In the past five years, the NCTA has presented 13 major multi-day festivals, 81 traditional arts concerts and 5 national tours with 146 performances, reaching 26 states, and produced 24 nationally distributed compact disc recordings.
