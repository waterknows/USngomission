Established in 1964 and currently in its 49th season, Portland Opera has established itself as a vibrant and vital part of the Portland region's cultural activity and identity. With its commitment to producing operas that invigorate the future of the art form and are dramatically and vocally compelling, Portland Opera has earned a devoted public following throughout the state of Oregon and southwestern Washington. A long time leader in making opera more accessible to a diverse audience, Portland Opera enjoys a reputation for innovative, groundbreaking productions. Portland Opera's Community Outreach and Education efforts have expanded dramatically in recent years with the establishment of Portland Opera To Go!, the touring division of Portland Opera.
