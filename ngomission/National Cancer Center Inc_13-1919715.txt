Founded in 1953, the focus of National Cancer Center (NCC) is two-fold: research and education. We are dedicated to the task of seeking out and providing financial support to researchers undertaking thorough, innovative, and promising studies on topics related to conquering cancer. The National Cancer Center also educates Americans on how they can reduce their risk of cancer. Over the past few years, NCC has distributed millions of education and prevention packets on such topics as breast, lung, prostate, and colorectal cancer, as well as needle biopsy aspiration. NCC is currently assisting researchers at a number of universities, including Harvard, UCLA, and Duke.
