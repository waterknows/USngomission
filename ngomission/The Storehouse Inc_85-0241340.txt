The Storehouse's mission is to provide assistance to people in need. For over thirty years the Storehouse has been a safety net that has provided food, clothing, and household items free of charge for people struggling to support their families in a time of crisis. There is never a charge for food or clothing at the Storehouse and we never turn anyone away.
