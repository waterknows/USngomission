Through a team built with integrity and in partnership with professional athletes, celebrities, organizations, and fans, the Teammates for Kids Foundation, co-founded in 1999 by Garth Brooks, exists to develop and implement innovative concepts that generate funds for the benefit of children's charities. The purpose of the Foundation is to contribute financial resources to selected non-profit organizations that effectively serve and benefit children with an emphasis on health, education and inner city services. The Foundation enlists the participation of professional baseball, hockey, and football players who contribute a predetermined sum based upon selected categories of on-field and on-ice performance.
