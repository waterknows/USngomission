Since 1970, Esperança has been providing health and hope for the world's poor through health and development projects and a volunteer surgical program in more than fourteen countries around the world, including the United States. Our mission is to improve health and provide hope for families in the poorest communities of the world through sustainable disease prevention, education and treatment. Each project is unique to the needs of that community, and we partner with local trusted agencies and community leaders at each project site to ensure that programs are culturally appropriate and build capacity. Esperança provides long-term solutions that promote sustainability and empowerment of the entire community.
