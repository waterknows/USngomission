Founded in 1966, Presbyterian Reformed Ministries International is a growing worldwide fellowship of Christians from the Presbyterian and Reformed churches. We are committed to spiritual renewal and to the advancement of the gospel of Jesus Christ in the gifts and power of the Holy Spirit. We work to ignite the Church in the power of the Holy Spirit, under the authority of Scripture as the Word of God. We aim to do this through prayer, leadership development, congregational renewal and mission outreach, so that the church will be empowered to do all that Christ commands to the glory of God the Father.
