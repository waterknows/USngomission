San Diego Second Chance creates opportunities for people to transform their own lives. We foster behavioral changes that promote personal responsibility, healthy relationships and positive contributions to society by addressing generational issues of poverty, unemployment, addiction, criminal thinking and homelessness. This is accomplished through programs that provide job training and placement, life skills, mental health and prisoner re-entry services, relapse prevention and sober-living housing for adults and youth in need.
