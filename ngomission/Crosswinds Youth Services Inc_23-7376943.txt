Crosswinds Youth Services (CYS) creates opportunities for young people to succeed, embodies our organization's primary goal of helping young people strengthen skills, develop leadership abilities, and reach their full potential. CYS began in the 1970s with a group of concerned community leaders who came together to discuss how Brevard County could respond to the increasing number of runaway and homeless youth in the community. Over the years, Crosswinds has grown to include a wide range of programs and services for young people and their families. Our programs include shelters, counseling, intervention and supervision, education, family therapy, transitional living, independent living, and community centers.
