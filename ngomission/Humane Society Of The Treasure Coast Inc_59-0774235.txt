Since 1955, the Humane Society of the Treasure Coast (HSTC) has been the leading advocate for animal welfare in the Martin County area. HSTC is an open admission shelter with no time limit on hope. We accept all animals regardless of health, age, temperament or breed. Our mission is to assure a better life for companion animals by providing shelter, finding loving homes and promoting respect for their place in our lives. HSTC cares for more than 6,000 animals every year. Over the years more than 100,000 animals have received care through HSTC's programs and services.
