Little Sisters of the Poor at St. Martin's Baltimore is located in a beautiful wooded setting just north of Wilkens Avenue in Catonsville. Our building does not look like your typical nursing home - because it isn't! We offer a continuum of care in a home-like, non-institutional setting. Levels of care include: Independent living apartments for low-income seniors; Assisted living; Skilled nursing care (Medicaid and Medicare certified). The Little Sisters of the Poor are an international congregation of Roman Catholic women religious founded in 1839 by Saint Jeanne Jugan. Together with a diverse network of collaborators, we serve the elderly poor in over 30 countries around the world.
