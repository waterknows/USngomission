Founded in 1985, Project Open Hand is a nonprofit organization that provides 'meals with love' to seniors and the critically ill. Our food is like medicine, helping clients recover from illness, get stronger, and lead healthier lives. Every day, we prepare 2,500 nutritious meals and provide 200 bags of healthy groceries to help sustain our clients as they battle serious illnesses, isolation, or the health challenges of old age. We serve San Francisco and Alameda Counties, engaging more than 125 volunteers every day to nourish our community.
