Founded in 1940 as a three-man Rotary Club service project known as Society for Crippled Children, Achievement Centers for Children is one of Greater Cleveland's most effective agencies providing high-quality services and programs for children with disabilities and their families. Our mission is to enable and empower children with disabilities and their families to grow, learn, play and prepare for lifelong achievement in society. Children served at the Achievement Centers have a wide range of disabilities including physical, neurological, sensory, cognitive, emotional or a combination of these. We focus on the key program areas of family support, education, autism, therapy & recreation/adapted sports. In fiscal year 2014-2015, the Achievement Centers served over 2,300 children and their families through our 3 locations and in community and home settings. Our dedicated staff are partners in a family's challenging journey and help children and their families find hope and get results.
