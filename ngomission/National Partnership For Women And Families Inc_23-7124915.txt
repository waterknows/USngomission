Founded in 1971, the National Partnership for Women & Families is dedicated to promoting public policies and business practices that expand opportunities for women and improve the well-being of our nation's families. We believe that actions speak louder than words, and since our founding we have played a critical role in enacting landmark policy from prohibiting pregnancy discrimination to giving families the opportunity to take the family and medical leave they need more than 100 million times. Today, we promote fairness in the workplace, access to quality and affordable health care, and policies that help women and men meet the dual demands of work and family. Through education, outreach, and legislative action, the National Partnership is an effective advocate for millions of women and families.
