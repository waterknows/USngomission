The Children's Leukemia Research Association, Inc. (CLRA), also known as the National Leukemia Research Association, was founded in 1965 to support research efforts towards finding the causes and cure for Leukemia. Forty years ago a child diagnosed with leukemia lived at best 6 months. Research has brought advancements in chemotherapy, drugs and transplants. Today children are living 5 years, 10 years and in some cases are in permanent remission. Progress has been made but we are not there yet. We strive for the day we celebrate a cure has been discovered. Until then we will support families to help understand this awful disease and through our Patient Aid Program.
