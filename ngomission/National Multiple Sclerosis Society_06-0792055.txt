The mission of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, Connecticut Chapter is to end the devastating effects of multiple sclerosis (MS). The Connecticut Chapter raises funds, through events such as the MS Walk, bike MS, MS Golf Classic, WAMS, MS Gala, MS Corporate Achievers and many others, to ensure ongoing scientific research to find a cause, advanced treatments and a cure for MS. These funds also provide for vital programs and services offered by the chapter to the more than 6,000 Connecticut residents battling the potentially debilitating effects of MS. These programs and services include: information and referral, education, scholarship programs, health and wellness programs, family and social support services, programs designed to address accessibility issues, long-term care assistance and much more.
