Empowering Lives International (ELI) focuses on providing accessible and appropriate knowledge, delivered in a cost effective and appropriate manner, which holds the greatest amount of long-term economic and relational impact among the needy. Formed in 1994, ELI integrates God's Word with ideas and practical, strategic trainings that equip the needy to make all important strides toward God and away from the chokehold of poverty. We bring empowerment to the poor through Training and Education, Care for Orphans, and Community Investment.
