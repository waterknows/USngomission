Founded in 1945, Memphis Union Mission ministers to the physical, spiritual, and emotional needs of men, women and children who are homeless, addicted, and in crisis. The ultimate objective for clients is for them to: become mature disciples of Jesus Christ; achieve freedom from substance abuse; reunite with family and loved ones; and reemerge as self-sufficient members of the community. Of the men who enter our 30-day Awareness Program, 79 percent graduate onto the long-term recovery program at Calvary Colony. And 59 percent of those men graduate from the recovery program. Of the women who enter Moriah House, 80 percent graduate from that program.
