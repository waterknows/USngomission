First Candle is a national health organization uniting parents, caregivers and researchers nationwide with government, business and community service groups to advance infant health and survival. With help from a national network of member and partner organizations, we are working to increase public participation and support in the fight against infant mortality. Born in the early 1960's as the National SIDS Foundation, the organization's primary focus was to support families that had experienced the death of a baby to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS.) In 2002, the SIDS Alliance board of directors voted to expand the organization's mission to address other areas of infant death, including stillbirth and miscarriage.
