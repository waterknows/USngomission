The Washington Humane Society (WHS), the only Congressionally-chartered animal welfare agency in the United States, has been the area's leading voice for animals since 1870. As the open-access shelter in the nation's capital, the Washington Humane Society provides comfort and care to nearly 30,000 animals each year through its broad range of programs and services including sheltering, adoption, spay and neuter, CatNiPP, humane law enforcement, lost and found, human-animal therapy programs and humane education. WHS operates two animal adoption centers, a low-cost National Capital Area Spay & Neuter Center, and a Behavior and Learning facility.
