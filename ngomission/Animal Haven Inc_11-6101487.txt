Animal Haven finds homes for abandoned cats and dogs throughout the Tri-State area, and provides behavior intervention when needed to improve chances of adoption. Founded in 1967, we operate a limited admission shelter/adoption center in Manhattan and a mobile adoption van. We also provide programs that enhance the bond between animals and people.
