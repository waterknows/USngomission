For more than 50 years, the Jewish Federation of Southern Arizona has served as our community's coordinating body for fundraising, planning, and communal services. Federation helps sustain and improve the lives of people in Southern Arizona, Israel, and around the world; wherever the needs are the greatest. Through a network of affiliated agencies, we help individuals and families, the old and the young, the unemployed, the homeless, the sick, the poor, and those who are persecuted or oppressed. In this way, Federation helps to fulfill a sacred Jewish promise which has shaped our culture for generations: the promise to build and care for our community here and around the world.
