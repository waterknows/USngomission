Founded in 1987, Priority-1 has been at the forefront of innovative programs in Jewish education. Its mission has always been to facilitate Torah education in areas and populations where it was lacking. Most recently, Priority-1 has embarked on an ambitious initiative to train teachers and parents across the country to effectively prevent at-risk behavior before it even starts. These training programs have been presented in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, New Jersey, Miami, Toronto and Jerusalem, Israel. One of the most significant and innovative accomplishments is Priority-1's Torah Academy High School, a unique alternative to the traditional Yeshiva high school. Small group instruction with emphasis on building self esteem, maturity and responsibility has yielded, in our experience, a young adult better equipped personally and socially to deal with life's challenges.
