CAST (Coalition to Abolish Slavery and Trafficking) is the first and only organization in the country dedicated exclusively to assisting trafficked persons. CAST provides direct services to meet the immediate food, shelter, medical and legal needs of trafficked persons. CAST also conducts advocacy and training to law enforcement, service providers, policymakers and the general public to improve survivors' access to justice. Since its establishment in 1998, CAST, the largest service provider in the country, has worked with hundreds of survivors of trafficking and trained over 10,000 service providers and law enforcement. In Spring of 2004, CAST opened the first shelter in the country for survivors of trafficking. On January 11, 2010, International Human Trafficking Awareness Day, CAST will launch a month long public awareness campaign to let communities know what they can do to fight human trafficking.
