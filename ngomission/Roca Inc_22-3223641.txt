Founded in 1988, Roca is a youth development organization committed to serving the most disenfranchised and disengaged young people ages 14-24 in the communities of Chelsea, Revere, and East Boston, Massachusetts. Roca builds relationships with the institutions in the lives of young people (criminal justice, child welfare, education, health, etc.). We provide the opportunities necessary for young people to live and succeed. Through intensive relationship building, Roca helps young people re-engage in society - moving them into educational, employment, and life skills programming. Roca has helped more than 15,000 young people make positive, profound changes in their lives.
