The American Eagle Foundation (AEF) is dedicated to protecting the majestic Bald Eagle, the USA's National Symbol, and its habitat by supporting and conducting eagle and environmental recovery and education programs. The AEF cares for a collection of about 80 non-releasable birds of prey daily (including 47 eagles), which play an important role in its education and breeding programs. Also, numerous orphaned and injured raptors are rescued, rehabilitated and released.
