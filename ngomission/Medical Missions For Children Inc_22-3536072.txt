Founded in 1999, the mission of Medical Missions for Children (MMC) is to help the world's critically ill children by: providing medical diagnoses and treatment via telemedicine to children and mothers in underserved communities around the world; facilitating medical knowledge transfer from those who have it to those who need it; and supporting applied medical research utilizing our state-of-the-art communications infrastructure. MMC has provided diagnostic consultations to almost 25,000 children using the talents of more than 600 physicians from 27 tier-one mentoring hospitals.
