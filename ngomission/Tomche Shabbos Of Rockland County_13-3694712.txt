Founded in 1973, Tomche Shabbos of Rockland County has been providing Shabbos and Yom Tov food packages to the Anyim of our community on a regular basis. Initially, there were only seven families that required our assistance. Late at night, the food was driven to the designated locations, whereupon the box was discreetly left at the front door.
