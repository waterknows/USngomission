Since 1977, The Spring of Tampa Bay has provided sanctuary and services to more than 50,000 abused adults and their children. The Spring is the largest of Florida's 42 certified domestic violence shelters and the first in the United States to have an accredited school on site. The mission of The Spring of Tampa Bay is to prevent domestic violence, protect victims and promote change in lives, families, and communities. The vision is to be a premier provider of domestic violence services and a positive force for social change, creating a zero tolerance attitude towards domestic violence in Hillsborough County. The Spring has seven service sites: the emergency shelter with an on-site school and child care center, a transitional housing apartment complex, three Outreach centers, and two thrift stores.
