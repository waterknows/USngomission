The Environmental Integrity Project (EIP) is a nonpartisan organization established in March of 2002 by former EPA enforcement attorneys to advocate for more effective enforcement of environmental laws. We have three objectives: 1) To provide objective analysis of how the failure to enforce or implement environmental laws increases pollution and affects the public's health; 2) To hold federal and state agencies, as well as individual corporations, accountable for failing to enforce or comply with environmental laws; 3) To help local communities in key states obtain the protection of environmental laws.
