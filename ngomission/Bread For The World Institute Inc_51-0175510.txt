Bread for the World Institute (BFWI) provides policy analysis on hunger and strategies to end it. The Institute educates its advocacy network, opinion leaders, policy makers and the public about hunger in the United States and abroad. BFWI is the research and educational partner of Bread for the World, generating studies on hunger issues and vital educational resources. We believe that a well-educated and motivated U.S. constituency who care for hungry people will ultimately change the politics of hunger. BFWI helps U.S. citizens tell the story of hungry people in their communities and see our connections to hungry people around the world. By empowering people with information, Bread for the World Institute affects real progress toward ending hunger.
