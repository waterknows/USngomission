Since 1987 Big Thought has developed and implemented quality creative learning programs. Our big thought is that all kids deserve the opportunity to think creatively, achieve academically, make healthy choices and become productive and engaged citizens. By uniting Dallas' civic, educational, arts and cultural resources in a coordinated approach, Big Thought is helping bring opportunities to learn, imagine, create and succeed every day to children and families across the city.
