The Truckee River Watershed Council was founded to implement locally developed public-private collaborative solutions to protect and improve water quality and biological resources for the sustainable environmental and economic health of the Truckee River Watershed. We identify, coordinate, fund and implement restoration, prevention and monitoring projects directly related to the health, beauty, and economy of the watershed. Combining ecological principals and a deep understanding of our region's values, we focus on the root causes of threats to the Truckee River watershed.
