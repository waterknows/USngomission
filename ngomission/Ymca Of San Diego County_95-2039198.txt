The YMCA of San Diego County is dedicated to improving the quality of human life and to helping all people realize their fullest potential as children of God through the development of the spirit, mind, and body.Character development is an important part of the YMCA Mission and through all its programs the YMCA works at teaching young people to accept and demonstrate the four core values of Caring, Honesty, Respect and Responsibility in their daily lives. Believing that environmental awareness is a key component of our character development education, we believe in environmental conservation and education.We accomplish our Mission through programs that will strengthen and enrich family life, build self-esteem and nurture personal growth, teach us to appreciate the world around us (through environment awareness, conservation, and education), develop leadership and strengthen communities, and encourage healthy lifestyles.
