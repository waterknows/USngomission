The United Way of Southeast Arkansas exists to ensure that as many as possible of our community's charitable dollars reach areas of greatest need. The United Way has been working to be a health and human services fund-raising leader in Southeast Arkansas since 1947. United Way raises funds through a single community-wide campaign to help meet local health and human service needs. The Campaign Goal is: "For every person to have the right kind of opportunity to understand and decide."
