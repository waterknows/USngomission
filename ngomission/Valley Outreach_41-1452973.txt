Valley Outreach is a bridge between the crisis of the moment and the solution of the future. We serve our St. Croix Valley neighbors by providing food, clothing, emergency financial assistance, providing education and support services, while respecting individual dignity and offering encouragement and hope, and connections to support services that will help them get from where they are to where they want to be.
