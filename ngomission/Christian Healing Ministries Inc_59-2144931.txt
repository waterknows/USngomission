Christian Healing Ministries' mission is to be a visible presence of Jesus' desire to heal in the world. Our vision is to make Christian healing prayer a way of life in families, churches, and medical professions. We want to spread the message of Christian healing, including the role of healing prayer in medicine, to teach and train others, to pray for Christian Healing, and to provide and coordinate healing prayer.
