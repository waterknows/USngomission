Located in Northern Wisconsin and surrounded by thousands of acres of state forest, Fort Wilderness Ministries is a year-round Christian camp ("family") serving over 8,000 people each year. For over 50 years, Fort Wilderness has been a refuge for youth, adults and families to build stronger relationships with each other and with God while having a great time. Fort is a big family, a place where many of our staff have committed more than 20 years of our lives doing what we love: sharing our lives and faith with everyone who comes our way.
