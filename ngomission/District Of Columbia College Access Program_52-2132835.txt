The District of Columbia College Access Program (DC-CAP) encourages and enables DC public high school students to enter and graduate from college. DC-CAP provides assistance to those students who might otherwise never have the opportunity to attend and graduate from college by providing the following: individual and group counseling; college information resource centers; college application assistance; financial aid assistance; parent education; college student support services; and "last dollar" award scholarships. All DC public high school students are eligible for DC-CAP assistance and support. DC-CAP will work with DC public high school graduates for up to five years after high school graduation to make sure they are able to complete their college education.
