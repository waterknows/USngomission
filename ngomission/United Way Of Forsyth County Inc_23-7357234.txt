The United Way of Forsyth County leads in uniting the community to bring together resources to identify and effectively address our community's most vital human needs. We mobilize our community to effectively address these needs; realize a high level of community support; and help to make Winston-Salem and Forsyth County an exceptional place to live and work. Our focus areas are strengthening families and children; increasing self-sufficiency and independence; building safer communities; and improving health and well-being. We have moved away from our focus on the number of people served and now concentrate on the results being achieved through the services being provided to the clients.
