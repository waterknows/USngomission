The National Multiple Sclerosis Society, Mid America Chapter mobilizes people and resources to drive research for a cure and to address the challenges of everyone affected by MS. The Mid America Chapter began in 1955 as the Kansas City Chapter with one staff member working out of his home. By 1982, the Chapter established the Ozark and St. Joseph branches. In 1985, the name was changed to the Mid America Chapter and in 1990, the Chapter merged with the Eastern Kansas Chapter. The Chapter and its three branches, Ozark, St. Joseph, and Eastern Kansas, currently serve 105 counties in eastern Kansas and western Missouri, and offer programs and services to over 30,000 individuals.
