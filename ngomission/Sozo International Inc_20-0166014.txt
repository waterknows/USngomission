Sozo International empowers the most disadvantaged individuals and communities by coordinating and implementing transformational development through health care, education, and economic initiatives. "Sozo" means, "to save, to heal, to rescue from danger or destruction." Sozo International formed in 2002, in response to the opportunity presented by the liberation of Afghanistan, shortly after September 11, 2001. Sozo International aims to reach the most impoverished people in identifiable communities where war and natural disaster have wreaked havoc. They provide emergency and ongoing relief for internally displaced people (IDP) and encourages development aimed at changing the day-to-day existence of people in need as well as providing hope for their future.
