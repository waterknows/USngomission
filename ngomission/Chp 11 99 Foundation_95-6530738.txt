Visionary civic leader Bob Weinberg founded the California Highway Patrol 11-99 Foundation in 1982 to provide emergency benefits to California Highway Patrol employees and their families in times of crisis. Since its inception, the Foundation has distributed more than $23 million in assistance to current, retired and "Fallen in the Line of Duty" CHP employees and their families.
