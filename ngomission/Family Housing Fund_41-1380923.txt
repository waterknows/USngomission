The Family Housing Fund (the Fund) was created in 1980 by the cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul and The McKnight Foundation to provide private financial support for affordable rental housing and homeownership opportunities for families in the two cities. Since that time, the Fund has gradually expanded its work to address the community's continually changing and growing housing needs. The Family Housing Fund divides its work into four main program areas: Home Ownership, Rental Housing, Supportive Housing, and Research and Public Education. Since 1980, Family Housing Fund's investments of $125 million have helped finance 26,400 units of affordable housing and leveraged $1.8 billion for affordable housing.
