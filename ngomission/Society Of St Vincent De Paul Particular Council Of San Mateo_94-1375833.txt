In the spirit of love and justice, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul of San Mateo County (SVdP) provides person to person services of time, talent and resources to help our neighbors in need. Central to the ministry of SVdP is our commitment to preventing homelessness. Through 33 parish based working groups called Conferences throughout all of San Mateo County, SVdP serves over 30,000 distinct individuals, almost half of whom are children annually, offering rent, utility and food assistance to keep families housed, medical aid and other basic survival necessities for those who are persistently unstably housed.
