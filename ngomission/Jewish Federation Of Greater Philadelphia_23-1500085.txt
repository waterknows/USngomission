Founded in 1901, the mission of the Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia is to identify and prioritize the important issues and needs of our local and global community, then organize and mobilize human and financial resources to successfully impact them. Jewish Federation focuses on Jewish education, human services, family, and economic needs, and provides support for Israel and for Jews at risk elsewhere in the world. We see a flourishing global Jewish community which is continually strengthened by inspiring participation in Jewish life and learning; caring for people at risk or in need; and connecting Jews in Greater Philadelphia to each other and to Jews in Israel and around the world.
