Established in 1986, the Community Foundation for the Fox Valley Region works to strengthen our community for current and future generations by helping people make a difference in the lives of others. We provide a way for individuals, families and businesses to permanently support local needs. People give through the Community Foundation to fulfill their charitable goals in easy, meaningful and efficient ways. Our service region includes Outagamie, Calumet, Waupaca, Shawano and northern Winnebago counties.
