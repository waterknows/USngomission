BrazilFoundation was established in 2000 with the goal of generating resources for social entrepreneurs who propose creative and innovative solutions to challenges faced by communities throughout Brazil. In 10 years BrazilFoundation has raised over $17 million dollars and supported more than 300 social projects in Brazil in the areas of Education, Health, Culture, Participatory Development and Human Rights. We provide project grantees with financial support while stimulating local advocacy and promoting access to goods and services, empowering communities to take responsibility for their own development.
