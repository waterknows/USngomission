Messenger International (MI) was founded in 1990 by John and Lisa Bevere in Orlando, Florida. MI inspires godliness while imparting freedom through uncompromised messages releasing people into their fulfilled life in Christ. MI is a para-church ministry that exists to help build and strengthen the local church. Over the past 20 years, John and Lisa have written over 20 books translated in over 60 languages, many of which are best-sellers with award-winning curriculum. Their television program, The Messenger, airs in over 200 nations. In 2008, the ministry launched their outreach branch, Pearl Alliance, to raise funds and awareness to prevent human trafficking and rescue those already enslaved.
