The Cherokee National Historical Society was formed in 1963 by a group of visionary Cherokee citizens who shared a desire to establish a permanent culture keeping institution for the Cherokee people. To accomplish their goals, they established the Cherokee Heritage Center. The mission of the Center is to promote, preserve and teach the Cherokee culture. The Cherokee Heritage Center's Education Department helps further the mission by presenting programs that incorporate the Cherokee culture through hosting a variety of hands-on cultural classes, special living classroom events, Cherokee games and offering a college level studies program for adult students.
